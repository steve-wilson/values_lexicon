At 39, I'm coming to realize this.  When I was first diagnosed at 34, all I could think of was all of the ways that it defined my life and how it had ruined it.  That opinion hasn't changed, but now I just try to focus on making the most of a day.  Before when I would deal with my clients, it was all I could do to not say to them "I don't know how to handle anything because I'm a crazy person, I shouldn't be trusted with anything".  Now it's "Look, I may be a little off sometimes, but I've never steered you wrong.  My recommendations have always panned out and we've worked together for all of this time because of that."

Then again, I also just spent about $4000 on new toys, emptying my bank account, so there's that.
Middle school + high school, first panel. Now = 2nd panel <.<
I'm getting towards the 2nd panel but trying this exact thinking. When the badness shows up (2 or 3 times a day), I remind myself I am not my feelings. These feelings will go away. 
Very accurate. About 7 years ago my mental health issues were crippling. I could barely leave my room. They never completely go away, but today I'm fully functional. I just got used to them and learned how to cope.
Yeah, make it your friend and know what it's good at. You have a gift that most people don't have. Use it where it helps and learn to deal with it when it doesn't. Bipolar mydelf
Good metaphoric illustrations. I currently use Ogden's Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T) as the "interoceptive" 9th of [The 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to manage any monsters that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the 

. . . a) cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking,  and Schema Therapy; the 

. . . b) "super" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT, the long-time gold standard for BPD symptom management), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR); and the

. . . c) "deep cleaners" like Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

One can look up all of those by name online. The CBTs deconstruct one's inaccurate beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be.  DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc. 

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look on the "therapists" and "psychiatrists" sections of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, on the "find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry" section of the WebMD website, the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator, and -- for DBT specialists in particular -- on the Behavioraltech.org website. If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often excellent sources of referral.

Pretty God damn accurate
Very true

Of course neuroplasticity is important--otherwise we would never learn to walk, talk, etc. But people who have what our society calls "mental illness"  have [measurable differences](http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v23/n1/full/nm.4246.html) in the functioning of their brains (which of course is only able to develop [because of the phenomenon of neuroplasticity](http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12050109#_i5)). 

Knowledge of the phenomenon of neuroplasticity does not suddenly grant sufferers the ability to change the functioning of their brains. Saying that psychological suffering is "just neural pathways in the brain" is analogous to saying that the pain of someone who just had their foot cut off is "just tissue damage" or "just signals from severed nerves." It's true, but not useful; it over-empashizes the reductive physical truth and ignores the subjective human experience. It does not make the pain go away, nor does it fix the underlying dysfunction.

If you want to argue that [our cultures help to create the narrative and reality of mental illness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drv3BP0Fdi8), I'm with you. If you want to argue that in modern society, [the state improperly utilizes the definition of mental illness as a measure of control](http://www.szasz.com/freeman31.pdf) I agree there too. But in denying the *reality* of mental illness as both a measurable objective truth and an unquantifiable subjective experience, in suggesting that it can be overcome by simply Googling the term "neuroplasticity," you are displaying a profound ignorance of neurobiology and a lack of compassion for your fellow human beings. 

*Neurotranskitters 
This is not the mechanism by which antidepressants work. They are reuptake inhibitors (the RI in SSRI) which reduce the reabsorption rate in pre synaptic neurons leaving the synaptic concentration of neurotransmitters higher, leading to higher rates of receptor binding. 

TLDR
Rather than making new neurotransmitters, SSRIs keep the existing ones around for longer. 
I'm pretty sure this is a Carrie Fisher quote...
Why the weird pill-cats, though?
Yea and SSRI (and I think the SS stands for selective serotonin? Not sure tho) can make bipolar go preettyyy nuts... Nevertheless I still love the drawing and how all the cats look like slippers and theyre all hugging eachother.

Reminds me of Dale Carnegie's coping strategy from his excellent book, "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" - to live in "day-tight" compartments.

Institutions all around Greece that deal with special needs people and are under the umbrella of the Greek Government haven't got a single cent for 17 months. We need to be heard since we can't afford working for nothing anymore. We risk closing and that means that we will lose every cent we even contributed from our own pockets to keep the institutions working. Our patience has run dry. All we need is for our voice to be heard and for greek journalists to notice us.

The principle behind this method is that our (unconscious) brains learn from our thought patterns and keep that pattern going, since the brain is always seeking a path to the least resistance. Actively become aware of negative thoughts, dismiss them. And the next step is to think of something positive, it'll become easier to do so over time (maybe a couple weeks at most and you'll be very able to do it). 

But if you have depression, you likely have mental fatigue too, so having that "will power"/energy is difficult to constantly suppress thoughts. The original post method is a great addition, as it motivates in some way and your brain has more energy to do something :). 

Also, if you've got it like me and the problem is chemical depression, you'll likely feel neutral and still mentally fatigued perhaps, but it is a big improvement from the negative thought spiral one day after another. 
Another good method is to imagine all criticism in the voice of Dale Gribble from King of the Hill.

Build a mental wall, a big beautiful wall, around those negative mental voices. Those voices are a disaster for you. Build the wall. 
This is absolutely glorious. Need to try this.
This is actually a really good idea! You could honestly picture anyone that you don't like. I'm gonna stick with Trump tho. An insult from him would just be ridiculous. 
Trump: you should not go outside. People will judge you. You will fail. You will feel embarrassed. You will panic.
Me: Fuck you and your fucking wall.



Effect: Still end up staying inside home.



Ignoring problems if they are really there are not going to fix themselves up automatically by some fix.


We're going to build a wall, and we're going to make anxiety pay for it!

It's nice to see her talking about it in the past tense, though!
This is a very good quote.

This is why it's so frustrating to hear people say things along the lines of "You have nothing to be sad about!" or "She has depression? But she's always smiling!" because sadness is only skimming the surface.
I'm slowly slipping back into depression these past couple of days after having a relatively decent week of fun and productivity. There's not really any meaningful reason for the change - I still have just as much opportunity to be productive and do things as I always do... But it feels like such a huge effort just to even be happy. I just feel more isolated, more adrift and like I'm stuck again. Stuck in the same rut I've been in for the last six years.

... That's basically the whole reason I've ended up here on /r/mentalhealth to begin with. Just when I thought I might be able to start living the rest of this year, even my life, being happy, it's dragging me down again. I'm determined to do all I can to not let it beat me though.
Wow what a profound statement. 
Did she have depression?
I get that last one a lot. 
Yes

One thing that was definitely needed this morning. Thank you for posting.
This is a very interesting view, thanks for sharing
While I have a mental illness, I've yet to meet an American who doesn't suffer with their own mind. 
Yeah dude 
Last night I went through a really down moment... then my boyfriend showed me this. So, so glad it helped you as well.

this is beautiful and I would love to hear the story behind these pieces! I have sent you a private message and hope you can take the time to view it! 
Being a person with all these issues, I see it. Beautiful expression of those. 
these are beautiful! i make similar style paintings about my depression  and such. do you post your art anywhere online?
These are beautiful! Pleeeeease do one on Borderline Personality Disorder. I have been looking for art and educational videos online and there's not a wealth of information out there, especially not information that's accurate or compassionate. It would be really great to see BPD get some artistic recognition. :)
Pretty! Love it!
beautiful. how did you make this effect with the paints?

These are wonderful, very interesting project. When you are finished with the series would you be willing to do an interview with a feature of your work on [Mental Health Matters](http://mental-health-matters.com/)? 
These are fantastic.
Done and done :)

Short story is I was diagnosed bipolar 9 years ago and only in the past 2 years have I accepted and embraced it. I didn't want to hide it anymore (in fear of judgement and the like) so I moved towards an open and testimonial attitude. I recently started to experiment with my art and expressing how these different aspects of myself look and feel. That's pretty much the short version!
Occasionally I will post on Instagram @chelseaallio but I also have an online store at Redbubble.com/people/inkcetera
Send me a pm so I can remember! I am totally up for it.
They are alcohol inks on a polypropylene "paper." When the inks hit this surface they are easily manipulated by gravity, blowing/canned air, or straight up alcohol or other solutions. Check out a youtube video! It is mesmerizing to watch.
Absolutely! That would be awesome. 
Great! I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of your work!

Yeah, this one hurt more than most for me (someone with OCD). 


A inspiration. Carrie Fisher gave me courage to not get help. When I was younger, like most young boys, she was a childhood fantasy. As an adult I have so much respect for what she did for me and the mental health community. 

Rip Carrie Fisher, you are now one with the force.
I am so crushed and not even because of her work on Star Wars. She did so many other things that I hope the general public gets more into and celebrates her for! I had no idea how outspoken and creative she was in tackling her mental illness until earlier this year when a friend said I had to watch Postcards from the Edge and Wishful Drinking. Time to pull them out again to salute her... 

Edit: not to say that she didn't do amazing work on Star Wars, I am just not particularly a Star Wars fan!
Legend. Thanks for the work Carrie.  RIP
Bipolar could be more psychological than chemical.

The pharmaceutical industry has an enormous profit motive to push the theory that it is chemical , but there isn't sound evidence or solid proof of that claim considering the significance of what rides on it.

Apparently multiple studies have shown other treatments like aerobic activity or "exercise" to be as effective as drugs, which doesn't support the theory of a sole chemical cause, at least it doesn't support the use of the artificial drug chemicals as the only viable treatment.  There is a significant risk of negative adverse reactions and complications with drug use that should NOT be summarily dismissed by those advocating health, especially concerning long-term use.  

Don't let drug companies capitalize so easily on celebrities to push drugs on you.  Don't let them use the celebrity status of the recently departed as a mouthpiece for some new agenda when that person isn't even able to speak for themselves.
To not get help?
I work in a psychiatric hospital
I see people that don't medication and try other solutions. I've seen patients that suffer a lot. I can't say for sure that i met all the people with bipolar disorder that don't take medication but those that i met are feeling better after medication
Bipolar disorder is almost certainly more complex than a simple chemical imbalance. But a chemical imbalance is undeniably part of it, which is why medication helps.
Why is "a chemical imbalance undeniably part of it"?  
If I take a drug like heroin, I feel better.  That doesn't prove I have a heroin shortage.
The answer here may lie in the subtle difference between feeling 'better' and feeling 'less awful'. If you - presumably a mentally normal person - take heroin, you feel high. If someone with bipolar disorder takes medication, they feel normal, instead of soul-crushingly terrible. 

It sounds a bit subjective and abstract, but that's how life is.
Didn't take you long to go from "undeniably chemical" to "subjectively feeling better".

Don't question the society that destroys people, just drug everyone out of their minds and call the new thing statistically "normal".  Just make sure you drug yourself with a socially acceptable substance, 'cause not all opiates of the masses are deemed equal.  That wouldn't be *normal*. 
My point is that, when it comes to the human mind, 'subjectively feeling better' is undeniable evidence that chemical imbalance is a factor.
hahaa.  Many of the therapies with effective and lasting results *aren't* chemical.  
I know.

wow I love that. I have been struggling with very dark negative unsafe thoughts this week and that just made me smile and almost cry with the feeling of support
Yep, now I'm crying. You made me cry.
As a therapist, this beautifully sums up what I see in my clients. The strength to overcome is already there; sometimes we just need a reminder that we're worth saving.
This strip is one of quite a few featuring [Boggle the Owl](https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/boggle-the-owl). The original source appears to be a [Tumblr account](http://boggletheowl.tumblr.com/) that still answers questions.
This is actually really helpful for me, especially today.
This is definitely wonderful. I guess this is not the best place to post this, but after reading that, I can agree that yes, I'm "staying alive", "hanging on", but I'm not making any progress. I'm not being a productive member of society or of help to my family. It's been years. Is just "hanging on" really enough?
I just broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years because of my depression and the fact I'm not doing anything about it. I've been jobless for a year living back at home with mum. We both agreed this was for the best right now. But I wanted to show her and myself I will get myself out of this hole. I cried my eyes out as I read this quote to her. I have never given up on myself, I've got my stick. It's time to move out of enemy lines. 
After I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a two week mandatory stint in the local psych ward (complete with police escort), I *saw* this in a couple of groups that I joined to gain a bit more perspective.  It's nice.  I like it.

Just thought I'd share that there as the other comments seem to be coming from other professionals.

Edit: I a word.
I really needed this today. 

Could have done without the crying, but they were happy tears and I will not be ashamed of looking like a blubbering child right now. 
This poster almost doesn't make sense at the beginning. The terrible font and the childish owl really made me detach from it. But it's like a spell and by the end, tears were in my eyes. Thank you.

Get cross-linked, this is what I do. I'm not really clever, I link thinks that feel necessary so the clever flows.
This is fucking great. Thank you for sharing. 
I hope things start looking up for you. Take care of yourself. That's what I tell myself, you don't have to love or even like yourself, but you gotta take care of yourself. Because in the end you're really all you've got.
Good tears I hope :)
Sometimes just hanging on is what gets you to something better down the road.  Sometimes it takes years.  Keep hanging on.
i dont really think therapy is effective
Hey, thank you for your reply and encouragement. You have a point. Being around means there's likely the possibility of things getting better. However, I feel that without active or strong positive efforts to change/live, things stagnate, and that isn't living either. Or is it? I guess it depends on person to person and their goals in life. Imo, my hanging on just feels like me wasting away. 

Apologies for being pessimistic. Thank you really for your comment. I wish you all the best. 
I think it is. And really.
I think most of us really do want to feel better.  We may not always feel up to doing the work it takes to get there, and it is okay to take some time off from this work.  But as you have suggested above, it really can make a difference if there are also times when we do work at getting better, even if we feel unmotivated/anxious/whatever. 

One way that can start is by leaning what things make you feel better, because that is very individual.  For one person that might be time spent with family, while another gets value from a long walk in the park.  Sometimes things that don't seem that appealing beforehand turn out to lift our spirits after all.
i think the most it does is kick the can down the road.
That's true. Someone once told me that we don't need reasons to do things. It should be do first, find a reason later. Otherwise, we'd never do anything because every reason when analysed too much becomes meaningless. I guess for me it's about taking the first step, and making an effort to try or do. 

Thank you for your reply. All the best to you. 
You can not pre-plan the scenario from your current situation.
And to you. :)
i can say that there are no words that will help me.
Yes.
that's all a therapist can offer me.
No. There are different activities about crafts, therapy animals, meditation techniques and sport-therapies, to name a few.
all not going to change me. 
Therapy that changes people is not even brain washing, it's straight out necromancy.
Mental illness, including depression, which is mine, is ACTIVELY trying to kill you. It does it by telling you that nothing can help, and certainly not something dumb like therapy.

I don't know for sure that therapy will help you. Occasionally it does not. But you might as well try it - there's an even bigger chance that your current thoughts are actually another assault by your illness.

Interior assaults are the most effective and most Insidious. This is why I love the Theodan and Denathor characters in Lord of the Rings. Saron ruined entire countries by assaulting their heads of state from the inside, much of the time via fatalism and cynicism.
i've never seen it happen. it doesn't produce a sustainable mentality for me.

had a therapist once told me that new techniques were really more like flavors of the month, all being just about as equally effective.
actually i have faith in magic mushrooms at the moment. but i'm still in the process of getting an experiment up and running to see if /r/microdosing holds it wieght.

i simply don't have faith in the information bubble that currently exists around the mental health care industry because i know past society biases have wrongly not been questioned by the mainstream thought.

> is ACTIVELY trying to kill you.

honestly, given the state of the world, i don't mind leaving it. that is a sober rational conclusion.
Out-numbering the possible routes you can take by an estimated thousand, I conclude through logical negation that you do not want to "pick and choose". From which I assume that you require a feeling of safety over a feeling of creative impulse. (Because that is a human need, a bit like eating and sleeping, but more important on a pyramid drawing I once saw!)

Well, since science does not give you what you need, I recommend investing in it until it does.
all i want to try microdosing magic mushrooms.

> Well, since science does not give you what you need, I recommend investing in it until it does.

i have nothing to invest
You have this here subreddit and time. I don't think "microdosing" is real to be honest. Or magic mushrooms. I think it's like smashing a computer screen open and saying "woah I interpret the lack of my own XYZ into the open hole". Because what the mind does not notice, it interprets by itself over blind spots.
why don't you think microdosing or magic mushrooms is real?
It sounds like a snack with side effects. And from the re-creations I saw I thought "meh".
reset.me

i see no reason why salvation should come from my human body, it can come for somewhere in the rest of me too, like magic mushrooms. 
You are dealing in absolutes, salvation doesn't come from a requirement.
> You are dealing in absolutes

are you saying we should absolutely not deal in absolutes?

> salvation doesn't come from a requirement.

absolutely?
Yes, and yes. Maybe my logic has beached on a koan again. 
This is my thought-process: Salvation is a freedom of need, requirement is a form of need, that means with a requirement there is no salvation.

Or "You would then be depended on magic mushrooms".
you're logic is self-contradictory and bullshit. absolutely not dealing in absolutes is inconsistent with itself, and cannot be true.

and i will never be free of need of oxygen, food, and water. adding magic mushrooms is not a huge extension. lol.
Yet you first try to get somebodies approval for it, like it mattered.
Or you are not searching approval, but having better logic is more fun than magic mushrooms can provide and it is creepy to be aware of this?
what do you mean i first try to get somebody's approval? i'm always looking for ways to connect with someone, approval is one of them ... ?

why not both magic mushrooms and better logic? i need something that logic cannot provide, i'm very good at logic, to the point that it impedes me in this world that doesn't really respect logic like i do.
I was mistaken, I thought you wanted my opinion on microdosing, to prove you know it better anyways.
I think that drugs make logic harder, because they damage the brain.
i had no end goal you are assuming, i'm just responding as i see fit. 

i would love for someone to change my mind, and i give them a chance, but people don't understand that their arguments are rarely unique. people aren't really all that different, when you cut the core at a deep enough level.
lol. talk about social conditioning right there.

you're completely wrong. most drugs do not damage the brain, and psychedelics would not be in that category.

alcohol, however, is. our society is backwards.
So you are waiting for the perfect argument, from an unique person, who you know does not really exist in this way, to change your mind?

I'm assuming (falling into intellection) when I got lost on track.
I must say, I don't have the slightest idea about the chemical details.
you are correct, i am not assuming a person exists than can change my mind in this regard.

i'm waiting for my family to cave on withholding money to me until i get a therapist. 
don't believe the egregious amounts of hasty generalizations this world likes to make. 
Or your could get a job.
I have a bit more insight than the chatter of educational TV, but yes.

Have you "found the world in a grain of rice", by the way?
or i could just starve. 
> found the world in a grain of rice

i dunno what you mean by that.
You can hold up any object and compare it's attributes to the entire world and find how everything that made the object is somehow made by the world. It's a form of meditation.
sure that's just analyzing how something came to be: systemic analysis of its roots. 

I had commented on this about why it's so problematic. They immediately deleted it. Meditation is great however many people who suffer from mental illness need medication. Without proper medication someone could become suicidal, self injurious, or unmotivated. Medication is not the enemy and organizations like this are extremely damaging. End the stigma on medications.
I agree completely, personally I believe that therapy and meditation should be tried first, but those things alone cannot always solve the problem. Many people rely on medication and they should not be shamed for that. 
Tried therapy, meditation, St Johns Wart and anything else suggested. Nope. Need drugs. Went off of them because I was pregnant and I was scared of what they would do to my baby. Husband moved out until I was back on something. Doctor told me that being on the meds was healthier then committing suicide. 
As somebody who doesn't necessarily believe that medication is the answer, yeah this is pretty problematic. 
Nothing helps me meditate like medication 
Ugh super cringe. What message are they conveying about people who use medication? 
People can and do recover from certain mental illnesses and, for them, medication is no longer needed. 

That being said, there are people who will always need medication and when they don't take their medication they wind up putting themselves or others in danger. 

One of the most frustrating things about working in community mental health is when I hear from people with severe psychosis that they or their family don't believe in medication. 

On the other hand, in addiction treatment, I hear from people recieving Suboxone and methadone treatment for opiate addiction that they want to be on these meds for the rest of their lives. That and doctors who precribe benzodiazapines for decades.
This is the same kind of shit parents lose their children over by trying to 'pray-away' disease and infection.
Mental illness is just that - an illness.  Diabetes,  heart disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol are all treated by examining the patient's medical history and lifestyle.  Mental illness should be treated the same.  We can't treat any illness with slogans.
I am not saying meditation doesn't work
I am saying that medication should not be shamed.
This shirt is problematic because it's basically promoting that meditation is the correct way while medication is bad.
I can only speak for myself I have no degree or work experience in the field of mental health.
I have been on many different types of meditation including plenty that had negative side effects.
The medication I am on now isn't perfect but I'm a whole lot better with it than without it.
I do believe in meditation, it's helpful and can be healing. But without medication that healing isn't enough. 
Without my medication I can't function normally. 
Therapy can be helpful but for some people therapy isn't enough, I do highly recommend looking into DBT skills if you suffer with depression or bipolar, a lot of them are very helpful. 
For me my medication helps motivate me to try, without it none of the coping skills matter because I have no motivation to use them.

Meditation and medication are great 
They should not be compared as a "greater or less than" kind of thing 
I used to take meds but meditation, especially visualization meditation proved WAAAAY more useful to me.. but that's me, I do think meds should be a last resort though.. I received way too many side effects from the ones I was taking (propranolol, escitalipram, clonazipram) 
It's not an either/or deal. BUT... It's crucial to understand that medications are only for stabilization of the "[fight-flight-freeze]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=fight+flight+freeze)" reactions to external threat or stress. They do not do anything meaningful for the more subtle "cognitive distortions" and "defense mechanisms" to which those with mental illness have been instructed, indoctrinated, programmed, conditioned, socialized, acculturated and normalized that are built on unrealistic beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be. Nor do medications induce "emotion processing." [Suggested reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/61mh21/medication/).

I'm medicated for anxiety, depression and a handful of other things. If you all were really supportive of people on meds you wouldn't be trying to shame me for giving my opinion in a separate comment in this thread.  This is not a supportive subreddit for mentally ill people, just another cruel club that shames people for speaking their mind. Think of what you're doing. We're all the same. Peace. ✌ 
Everyone's treatment and recovery is their own boat to row. For some people, that will include medication and for others it won't. As has already been said, people shouldn't be shamed either way. 
It works for some people, and some people do end up on medications they don't actually need. Just because it doesn't apply to you personally doesn't mean there's something wrong with it.
I have no qualms with this. Our country is over medicated and everyone knows it. This doesn't mean that certain people don't need medication.

Combined with my ability to read others well, I end up saying that coldest, most damaging thing possible while the real me  watches in horror from outside my body almost. It's never loud or expletive filled, just nasty and abusive. Bless medication because it lets me be the real me, who's patient and kind.
This idea seems to elude people when they hear that you're on medication. Currently if I wasn't on my medications, I'd become manic, self injuring, suicidal and depressed. Hmm. (Sarcastically) "Maybe if I meditate long enough or pray hard enough, maybe I won't have bipolar disorder anymore." Mental illness is not always temporary think, but can be a permanent condition. Ugh. This frustrates me to no end. Don't tell me that I'm not trying hard enough or that I'm weak just because you're a war veteran. 
Agreed. Thanks for standing up for all of us who wouldn't be here without our meds
I'm all for medication *if* the person has already tried improving their lifestyle in terms of their diet, exercise, sleep, and other habits (could include meditation.) The reality is that a lot of people don't.

Lifestyle changes are not a guaranteed fix, but neither is medication, so it makes sense to try the option of not being dependent on meds first.

-- A couple of clarifications I should've made clearer from the start:

 - I'm talking about illnesses for which it has been proven that in certain cases, environmental changes can be just as effective of a solution, if not better, than medication. i.e. not for an illness like schizophrenia.

 - My suggestion doesn't apply to extreme cases where someone is on the verge of seriously harming themselves or others. These, though, are the minority of cases.
Its a tshirt, don't be so sensitive and self righteous about it.  That's her truth not yours.  Let her speak hers and you speak yours. 

Edit: I take meds myself and need them.  But really if you want to be as knee jerk about such trivial things then nobody is going to take you seriously no matter how serious of a problem you have.  It's just a tshirt.
I have a friend who's convinced being on meds means she's weak and she keeps trying to stop them and function.
> being on the meds was healthier then committing suicide. 
Your doctor has a nice sense of humor.
Yeah it kind of terrifies me how a lot of psychiatric meds have "we don't really know much about how or why it works, but it works" attached to the prescription, but once you find the right meds for your disorder it is downright heavenly and you realize that meds can really help.
This is so true.  In depression, blocked from being present by the consuming void, in mania, broken by the cry of exultation.     But when the blinding fire of the brain subsides, the mind can settle gently, and be.

>I hear from people recieving Suboxone and methadone treatment for opiate addiction that they want to be on these meds for the rest of their lives.

Are you saying that you think that's good, or bad?

I think it's completely fine if that works for them; What works for one person may not work for others. And if methadone helps an individual achieve a certain quality of life, and  helps them be a "productive members of society," (eg. Working, paying their bills, relative happiness, etc.) rather than a much worse alternative,  then who is anyone to say otherwise. [And we can argue about political philosophy if we want to delve into our conception of what "citizenship" and productive member,"  etc.  means.]

I don't necessarily want to see anyone *need* a drug to function, but fuck me if I ever judge that as good or bad based on moral spooks.  

As long as they aren't a danger to themselves* or others, and are living the way that works for them, keep on keeping on. 
Harm reduction. +++
__________

*requires a massive footnote here as well.   
True. And some mental illnesses have a known physical component and some don't. And some people respond better to medication, some to meditation, some to both or neither.
No one is being shamed for speaking their mind.   The tshirt shames people who need medication, or who's illness is pointless to address without stabilization by medication FIRST.

Yeah, the problem is that it's a dangerous idea to suggest to vulnerable people that medication should only be a last resort. The reality is that for some people medication has to be a first resort. I am a masters level therapist and i have worked with people who get to a point where medications aren't needed anymore. That is a personal choice. I have also worked with way too many people who live with severe psychosis and think that medications are unnatural and they want to try a vegetarian diet and eating more walnuts because a guy they met in the park recommended it. 

I will not ever support a blanket message that medication is unnecessary. The only appropriate message is that each individual case needs to be assessed for the appropriateness of medications. 
You realize it says "an mountain", right?
Thanks for saying this. The meanness and rage is a new facet of depression I've just figured out and it's so frustrating.
I'm on two antidepressants and an anti anxiety med.  I also run 5+ miles a day to feel better. I still wake up with horrible depression and anxiety occasionally.  How would I be without meds I always wonder!?
Could you elaborate the "my ability to read others well, i end up saying that coldest, most damaging thing possible" part. I mean how do you read people?  Peoples ability to read others always made me curious about how they could have done it.
(sorry for any grammatical mistakes it has been a long time since the last time i spoke English)
This type of mindset is really damaging to those of us who actually, really DO need medication to function. You can be "all for" it or not but the truth is, it shouldn't make a difference to you whether I tried meditation and lifestyle changes or not before I went on medication to manage bipolar disorder. If you haven't been through it, don't try to make sweeping statements about how in reality people blah blah. 
Lifestyle changes can work wonders for some people. But a person with severe mental illness, like schizophrenia, severe depression, or bipolar disorder are going to need meds. 

Advocating that a person with severe depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder should just learn to use a stairstepper and eat more broccoli is a real good way to keep someone away from the treatment they need, resulting in people dying. 

Your remarks and attitude are careless and harmful. 
T-shirts are advertisements. This t-shirt promotes a harmful idea. A person who needs meds could see this t-shirt and think that they don't need their meds. 

This kind of crap happens all the time.  You go ahead and work with a caseload of people living with schizophrenia, half of whom don't take their meds, then get back to me about how trivial this attitude is. 
It's not about self righteousness, it's great if meditation works for someone however putting it in a way like this makes it seem like meditation is inherently better than medication. That's what I see as the issue 
Basically this is the sum of the conversation I always have when I talk about my disorder. Being on medication or not, is a deeply private and sometimes hard decision to make and being lectured to about either decision is more harmful than beneficial. 
I liked that he was also very blunt. I'm a big woman. When I couldn't keep food down for weeks he told me not to worry and that the baby would live off the fat of the land. 
It is bad. Suboxone and methadone are not meant to be taken for life. They're meant to make the process of opiate withdrawal easier. It's meant to be gradually reduced until it's no longer needed. They aren't meant to allow the person to stay addicted for the rest of their life. 

> What works for one person may not work for others.

I think this is the key. If someone was on medication and it wasn't working, and picked up meditation and stopped the medication and that was better, why should anyone else complain about them wearing this t-shirt? It will probably prompt conversations with people, and then it's on both of them to remember that what works for them may be different from what works for others.
>The only appropriate message is that each individual case needs to be assessed for the appropriateness of medications.  

Nailed it. 

I think the problem we have here is that people attach multinational corporations to drugs, or rather the **industry** of drugs (which they obviously are) and from say, a structuralist perspective, yeah this is definitely a problem. But saying that drugs are bad, in and of themselves is, in most cases, completely fucking absurd.  It's the equivalent of believing that all GMO's are bad for the same reason. Sure, shady shit does and can go on in MNC's and agencies like the FDA, (eg. regulatory capture) hence for example, maybe some drugs aren't as tested as we are told, or with doctors in clinics over-prescribing drugs (eg. Ritalin) but it is still a mistake to conflate that evil for the drugs themselves. 

Meditation vs. medication is a false  dichotomy. 



          
> I will not ever support a blanket message that medication is unnecessary.

What strikes me is that so many of us take the t-shirt as a blanket message. We could just take it as a message about what worked for her.
Man, y'all get whiny about jokes in here.
My parents, especially my dad, and I all get the rage. Just flip the fuck out over nothing. My brother doesn't seem to rage as much, and my mom tends toward hopelessness and tears. I've been dealing with it long enough that my first thought when I have really violent thoughts is "Did I take my medication?" It's difficult though, because it honestly just comes off like emotional abuse to other people, not the symptom of an illness. I tell my close friends to just say, "You're being a real cunt over nothing. Did you take your medication?" and anymore it's enough to get me back on track. I also take a birth control to control my hormone levels to avoid any anger spikes due to that crap. Hurray depression! Such fun. 😒😒
I dunno, my dad and I are both good at it. I think we both notice body language a lot, and strange ways of speaking. We both observe and listen a lot, and people tend to just come up and tell us things. Part of that is an American thing; it's semi normal to get into a discussion of stomach health when you see some stranger at the store looking at probiotics. But sometimes it's very dark or sensitive things and people just tell us out of nowhere.  Other times they completely avoid a topic, and that always seems odd to me too.

One example would be that I can tell when someone's hiding the impact an event had on them. I knew someone who's parents divorced shortly after he was born. He didn't seem affected by it to most people. I could tell he had internalized the rejection by his dad and it manifested in a weird perfectionism and desire to be well liked to the point that he had no opinions unless he knew you were a safe person who wouldn't leave. I tried to ask him if he needed to talk or whatever but he would just get kinda brusk and change the subject.

I knew a kid in college that everyone thought was very cocky and self assured. I looked at him, thought he seemed like a former fat, shy kid who was overcompensating for his self hatred and insecurity, and felt sad that he needed to act like that. Later on I found out I was 100% right. In both these cases, it would have been really easy to go for the throat when I was in rage mode and really hurt those people.

So, I guess it's a combination of knowledge of psychology and human emotional needs, empathy, body language reading, and observation.
I haven't been through bipolar disorder specifically, which is why I clarified I'm talking about the most common disorders where lifestyle changes in themselves have been proven to work, namely anxiety, depression, and ones that stem from those.

> it shouldn't make a difference to you whether I tried meditation and lifestyle changes or not before I went on medication

I'm not invested in your personal life, and it doesn't make a difference to me what you choose to do. You don't get to dictate who  deserves to feel strongly about something or not. I have an opinion, it's fine if you disagree. If it's "damaging" to you, that's on you.

> If you haven't been through it, don't try to make sweeping statements about how in reality people blah blah. 

I've been through severe mental illness myself. Illnesses for which many think medication is the only option. I've also been close to people who've killed themselves *because* of their medication, and others who've had medication save their lives. Just like you have your opinion on this subject, it's also valid for me to have one.

> This type of mindset is really damaging to those of us who actually, really DO need medication to function.

Similarly, I can say your type of mindset is really damaging for those who could keep their illness under control without medication, yet they resort to medication and end up dependent and/or worsening their symptoms.

The difference between my mindset and yours is that I'm saying at least try lifestyle changes before medication, that way you'll know if you actually need meds or not, rather than blindly choosing meds. While you're completely dismissing lifestyle changes. It could even be argued your mindset is even more damaging than mine, as you're completely dismissing a possible solution.

> Advocating that a person with severe depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder should just learn to use a stairstepper and eat more broccoli

I didn't say I advocate *just* lifestyle changes. I'm suggesting that for the most common disorders, for which lifestyle changes in themselves have proven to be a valid treatment option, it makes sense to try that before resorting to medication. Assuming both lifestyle changes and medication work, the former is obviously superior. In the more extreme cases (the minority) though, I agree that medication should be tried ASAP since lifestyle changes often take a lot more time and effort. I'm not saying someone with obvious signs of paranoid schizophrenia should try going for a jog and eating spinach, it's ridiculous that I have to explicitly clarify this.

I feel strongly about this because I suffered from depersonalization/derealization, panic disorder, pure-OCD, and depression at a point in my life and have learned how to manage and/or overcome it without medication.

> use a stairstepper and eat more broccoli

The fact that most people in this country consider that a significantly positive lifestyle change is part of the issue.
Meditation and meds have helped me.  I don't know too many schizophrenics who meditate because it's more for anxiety and depression.  I just think it's foolish to make it a binary decision between meditation or medicine. Both sides are just telling their truth.  In reality both are valuable tools. 

T-shirts advertise everything and this is clearly designed to provoke mentally ill people who are overly defensive. I don't like seeing it trivialized in a tshirt but I also don't like trump hats. I don't care though because it isn't going to change anything unless people blow it up by overreacting.  Neither is going away...relax.
And you thinking this tshirt actually matters is what I see as creating an issue out of nothing. You want to be on the right side of a non debate. 
We don't pad the world for babies and we don't censor our t-shirts for the easily influenced.  At least not in the US. I made an assumption this was about American culture.
I'm on a bunch of meds, she says she doesn't think of me as weak but she can't stop thinking that about herself. I just try to be supportive and lend an ear.
This so much. People on both sides of the fence need to stop shaming each other.
[deleted]
There are industries for the production of medication, and industries for the teaching of meditation.  When done by their target customers, they are both can be quite expensive... but also, can be inexpensive.  My primary med costs about $60/month, true retail.  Meditation will cost me about 10-15 hours/month, so a bit pricier in wage standards, at about $120/month.     Seeing my psychiatrist for more professional assistance... $250/mon;  seeing a mindfulness therapist that teaches... $400/mon.  retail prices again.

Both are structuralist, greedy corporation, evil capitalist processes.  There is not good vs bad to be had here.
Jokes are supposed to make sense. 
Lol, "Hurray Depression!" Should be the title of my next book of comics. I say that way too much.
[deleted]
Did you read any book about that? Or its pure skill and experience?
"last resort" is the wrong sort of language to use.   It means trying therapy or meditation first.  When for many, many people, attempting those first is a complete waste of time.  I learned meditation techniques very young, and practiced them most of my life.   Didn't and couldn't do a thing to stop a bp episode.     Now that I have some meds for it, I can use meditative techniques to polish up the edges of comfortable function.

A doctor should be determining which should be last resort and which should be first for any particular person.
>I'm not saying someone with obvious signs of paranoid schizophrenia should try going for a jog and eating spinach, it's ridiculous that I have to explicitly clarify this.

But it's not ridiculous. There are people who read what you write who are attempting to find answers. You advocated that everyone should try lifestyle changes before getting medication, you didn't specify what people or what mental illnesses. 

>I'm suggesting that for the most common disorders, for which lifestyle changes in themselves have proven to be a valid treatment option, it makes sense to try that before resorting to medication.

This is a far too simplistic understanding of mental illness. You are talking about things like Major Depressive Disorder, without any consideration for the reality of that disorder. 

Eating a balanced diet and getting daily exercise are part of a healthy lifestyle. Starting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is possible because most people have the willpower and motivation to adhere to those life choices. Major Depressive Disorder impairs that willpower and motivation. 

Major Depressive Disorder is inherently an impairment of functioning. It's part of the diagnostic criteria. If a person had every symptom of MDD but showed that it wasn't impacting their ability to function, I would not diagnose them with MDD. 

What MDD does impact is a person's ability to care. Their interest in maintaining their health and daily activities tends to drop. They tend to isolate. Their willpower and motivation tend to deteriorate. They not only don't care about things, they can't care about things. This is not a time when a person is likely to develop and adhere to a new workout routine. They probably know they should, but they can't care enough about it. This apathy is often what leads to suicidality. 

So if a person presents to me in this state, should I suggest that they go jogging for 30 minutes a day for a week and get back to me? I will not. It is not likely to be successful, and it will leave that person feeling that they have failed and worsen their depression. I will make a referral to a psychiatric practitioner and get them on some meds. Then once those meds have started improving the person's symptoms, we can start on the process of improving lifestyle and learning coping skills. 

You're also making a pretty huge assumption about correlation and causation. Do a person's mental health problems usually result from a poor lifestyle, or does a poor lifestyle usually  result from mental health problems. Knowing what I know about the symptoms of MDD, and other disorders would say it's much more likely to be the later. 

What University is your PhD from?
> meditate because it's more for anxiety and depression. 

THAT is the nature of an advertisement.   "more for".  complete bs.  complete, unprovable bs.   The only thing that is true is that there are a lot more cute girls wearing tshirts that suffer from MDD/GAD than there are sz/bp thus a larger market.

In fact, given the nature of things, if I had to bet on a hypothesis, I'd bet that the percentage of high functioning sz/bp folks who work meditative techniques HARD far exceeds the percentage of MDD/GAD folks that do.

Still would be tough to really prove though.
words matter.   It absolutely does matter.   You are allowed to write and say what you want.  Others are allowed to call you out on its cruelty.
It's not a false dichotomy for the person who experiences it, it's a true sharing that X worked when Y didn't. I agree that in the current context of beliefs/attitudes around mental health the shirt would be improved if it had an asterisk that said "...worked for me. Something else may work for you." The same label should be required on ads and other materials on medications.
>There is not good vs bad to be had here. 

Exactly. It's a false dichotomy. You're helping solidify my argument for me. Thank you. 
I understood her as soon as she started her account. I'm the same way. I don't take Vyvanse, but I am on Adderall + Wellbutrin which works like nobody's business for me. When the Adderall wears off, the potential for rage comes back but normally I'm getting ready for bed at that point so not in the danger zone.
I take 40mg Vyvanse and 60mg Prozac. I've taken the Prozac for over a year and it's helped. It has a lot of side effects going on the Prozac but once I got to 40+mg it was fine. I've also tried Zoloft (stopped working after 6 months), Lexapro (even with the Vyvanse I slept like 14 hrs a day), and Welbutrin (worked fine but went off it to add the Vyvanse back in the mix since I could afford it once again). I took Prozac and Welbutrin together for a while but couldn't increase the doses without some serotonin syndrome type stuff.

My brother and my dad do Adderall and Welbutrin, so Welbutrin might be a good option.

The birth control I take is Yaz. It's the only thing that works for me. It treats PMDD and endometriosis, so it's one of the heftier drugs as far as hormone levels. I love it. I've been on it for years. I tried switching to a different birth control that was cheaper and had an awful time so I went back. I take active pills only and do not have the pill period.

Hope that helps!
Just a skill I have, but a book on like, how to be a fake psychic or how to influence people might tell you something
You tried lifestyle changes (how and what you tried is a whole topic of its own,) they didn't work, so you went with medication. That's exactly what I'm suggesting people do.

Great, you tried. You wouldn't have known if you hadn't tried it. It's irrefutable that for some people, lifestyle changes alone can keep their mental illness under control.

> When for many, many people, attempting those first is a complete waste of time.

True, and  the opposite can also be said. For many, many people, attempting those first is *not* a complete waste of time, and actually a legitimate solution.

You don't know which pool you fall into until you try it. There are also more categories to consider, like those who don't respond to either lifestyle changes or medication, or those whose condition is worsened by medication. Out of the scope of my original point, but something to consider if you think meds should be the first thing you try.
Fair point about initially not specifying which conditions I was talking about. I've clarified it. I understand that mental illness itself can prevent someone to have the capacity or motivation to act upon lifestyle changes. All I'm suggesting is that if possible, they at least give lifestyle changes serious consideration. If for whatever reason they find themselves unable to, or it doesn't do shit for them, nothing's stopping them from trying medication. I'm not advocating against medication at all costs. 

> You're also making a pretty huge assumption about correlation and causation. Do a person's mental health problems usually result from a poor lifestyle, or does a poor lifestyle usually result from mental health problems. Knowing what I know about the symptoms of MDD, and other disorders would say it's much more likely to be the later. 

I'm not making any assumptions about the cause of the illness itself. You're actually making an inaccurate assumption about what I'm assuming. Whether it's genetic, environmental, or a mix of both (this is actually more probable), my suggestion is the same. If lifestyle changes work, it doesn't mean there's no genetic component to it, or that the illness was purely environmental. It's a fact that in certain cases, environmental  factors can trigger, or exacerbate a mental illness. Therefore a change in your environment could possibly work in the opposite way, mitigating the bad symptoms, or even putting you into "remission", as it did for me.

These are the actual assumptions I'm making:

 - Both medication and lifestyle changes are proven to be *possible* solutions to certain mental illnesses. i.e. neither is a guaranteed fix.
 - Assuming both solutions work for you, lifestyle changes are superior (if we don't agree on this one then there's really no point in debating and we should just agree to disagree)
 - Assuming none of the solutions work for you medication still carries more risk in the form of potentially worsening your condition, serious unrelated side effects, abuse, etc.
 - You never know whether something will work for you until you try it.

It makes perfect sense to, if possible, try a lifestyle change before biting the bullet on meds.

yw.  reading that last line, I hope that its clear enough I'm not really trying to beat up on pharma nor therapists; everyone should expect to be paid for their work and should seek to optimize their return on investments.

I definitely agree with your conclusion of "false dichotomy".  

Yes! Apparently the mechanisms that causes mania, hypomania, and ADHD symptoms are all kinda similar. I've never had any other ADHD symptoms, and if I have bipolar 2 it's pretty depression heavy with the bare minimum of hypomania. But, both cause rage with the heightened focus and energy. I think there's probably something connecting people with depression who have the rage fueled energy (to do basic life activities) and that anger that shows up in a lot of other mental illnesses. 
I'm not the one claiming to be an expert.
I agree, a PhD is not required, but specialized education and experience are. Do you have a firm understanding of the theories behind the diagnosis of mental illness? Do you know about biopsychosocial theory? Do you understand research methodology? Do you understand statistical analysis? Do you know what research backs the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5? Do you understand how to interpret that research? Do you have the experience working day in and day out researching and/or treating people who live with mental illness? 

Behavioral Health is a very complicated field. People who work in behavioral health are required to have education and experience and demonstrated understanding of mental health issues. 

There was a time when I thought I knew enough to recommend things to people just because I had a mental illness myself and because I read up on it. I look back on that advice now and cringe.

The main problem was that I didn't have any idea of what I didn't know. I had to learn about those things that I'd never even considered, through education. The process of education, training and experience have actually made me the expert that I thought I was. 

Can you have an opinion? Sure. Is it wise to share this opinion when vulnerable people who don't understand how limited your understanding is are likely to read it? No. 

I'm not just arguing with you for fun. Everyone can have an opinion, but if your opinion is potentially harmful, which yours is, it becomes a problem. 



Shockingly, having an opinion does not mean you're an authority on the subject. If so I should really be making more money as a spokesperson for Ben and Jerry's, since I'm an authority on Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavors. What with my opinion, critical thinking and research.
Not at all.   NO ONE is saying they don't have a right to print such a thing on a tshirt.   Why are YOU so sensitive to the idea that others find what was printed to be invalidating; you want to protect the speech on the tshirt, but not the speach of the critique.

I want to protect both.

If medication does not work for the person wearing the shirt, and meditation does, then the dichotomy is not false.
Your standards for education are way too low if you think one needs to be an "expert" to understand and reason about the points I presented.
I can see how saying something like "don't take medication, change your lifestyle and you will get better. Trust me." is harmful, which is what I assume you're getting at. But I fail to see how advocating for a serious attempt in lifestyle changes *before* biting the bullet on meds is worse than going straight to medication.

> I'm not just arguing with you for fun. Everyone can have an opinion, but if your opinion is potentially harmful, which yours is, it becomes a problem.

The same can be said about your opinion.

My whole opinion can be simplified into: if possible, seriously try lifestyle changes before trying medication for conditions where lifestyle changes have proven to be possible effective solutions. How is that more dangerous than always prioritizing medication, which still isn't a sure fix, and could also potentially worsen your condition or have unintended side effects?

It doesn't take specialized education to understand this.
I laid out my opinion, I felt it was misunderstood/misrepresented, and I attempted to clarify. No where did I claim I was the authority. Good thing it's just an opinion on reddit where anyone is free to agree, disagree, or simply dodge my points and resort to personal attacks.

Anecdota does not evidence make. We are talking about an actual science, not your preference between coffee and tea.
Okay 

"my opinion is that the Holocaust never happened. My evidence is that it would have taken hundreds of years to burn all of those bodies."

Now respect that opinion based on the evidence that I have provided. 

The opinion I provided was offensive and incorrect. The evidence I provided was nonsense. 

But you'd better damn well respect it, right?
You are confusing the proposition of a generalization with the proposition of a specific case.
It's fact that lifestyle/environmental changes can be an effective form of treatment for certain mental conditions. I presented an anecdote to support that fact. You're free to do your own research if you don't believe me. Trust me it's not that hard, you don't need to be an expert. 

It's no different than other people on this sub saying medication saved their lives. Just because they didn't cite multiple research studies doesn't invalidate what they said.

Evidently people here think it's a pissing contest and don't care for facts unless they support their viewpoint. It's not hard to find studies supporting lifestyle changes. A few seconds on Google got me: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3674785/

"In summary, exercise appears to be an effective treatment for depression, improving depressive symptoms to a comparable extent as pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy."

Now, if someone provides actual evidence that attempting lifestyle changes before medication is "harmful," I'm all ears and open for debate. But despite all the replies I've gotten telling me how wrong I am, all I've gotten are attempts to invalidate my argument by attacking my credibility claiming I'm not "qualified" or that I'm not an "expert," which is basically ad hominem, since nothing in my argument requires extensive, professional expertise in mental health.

I suspected a large amount of users here are currently on medication, and did not attempt significant lifestyle changes before resorting to pills, so the downvotes are understandable. Our viewpoint bruises their egos by basically saying "what you did might have not been optimal."
What evidence do you bring that supports that claim? 
For some people, it is that black and white. For them, the dichotomy is real.

For other people, meditation and medication both have a role. For them, the dichotomy is not real.
Now you're just misrepresenting your opponent's position. No one has ever said that attempting lifestyle changes before medication is harmful. 

What is harmful is the statement that lifestyle changes should always be tried before medication. 

Instead of acknowledging that you may be wrong, you chose to flat out lie about the position being taken by your opponent. 

If a person has years of education and experience, and you don't, it may just be that they know more than you do. It's not an unreasonable assumption.

You aren't qualified and you're not an expert. That's not ad hominem, it's a fact.

I clarified my position several times, limiting its scope, and admitted that was my original mistake. You continued arguing. So you've either ignored my clarification, or you are actually saying that lifestyle changes before medication is bad.

> You aren't qualified and you're not an expert. That's not ad hominem, it's a fact.

That in itself is not ad hominem. Claiming my opinions or arguments are invalid because of it, is. Qualification is also subjective in this case. Someone with more expertise than you can claim you aren't qualified, and that you're no expert either compared to them. Does that mean you're wrong? Not necessarily. That person might or might not agree with you, but "qualification" doesn't determine the validity of your argument, only the argument itself does.

Hypothetically speaking, if an established expert shared my viewpoint and I simply repeated his words verbatim, would that make the point invalid because it's coming from me? No, you'd have to look at the point itself. Sure you can have suspicions and bias based on my background and expertise (or lack thereof) but ultimately that doesn't determine the point's validity.

One doesn't need to know the inner workings of a car, the physics of steering, and the history of vehicles, to have a valid opinion on how to drive.
Let me know when you've started debunking. So far all I see is misrepresenting and baseless claims. 


I read and have no issues with the paper presented. 

It doesn't provide any evidence to support your claim, though. 

You act as though my position is that exercise does not work for depression. 

My position is that exercise should not always be tried before antidepressants are prescribed. 

I have already given you my reasons for this position. 

Even the very article you cite states what I have already stated: The symptoms of depression are going to be a barrier for some people. The article  recommends using motivational interviewing. However MI is not a panacea. 

What the article does **not** say is that exercise should always be tried first before prescription medications.

So you still haven't provided evidence to support your claim. 
I know what it is. I'm not sure why you don't want to accept that "medication vs. meditation" is a false dichotomy for some people, and not for others.

Didn't reply to [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/649vps/this_is_problematic/dg3wctl/) either proving they're just using ad hominem.
I get that some people are averse to taking medication when they might benefit from it, and the shirt probably doesn't help them. I already agreed with you that a qualifier would make it better.

Some people have a hard time getting off of medication when they might benefit from that, and the shirt probably does help them. (And note that it doesn't specify mental health medications.)

Most of all imho, we need to stop looking for any one-size-fits-all solution, because different things work for different people. Which I think is where this all started.
[deleted]
Only if you take it as applying to everyone and not just the person who's wearing it! *That's* the problem here!

EDIT: And again I agree a big qualifier on the shirt would help. As would big qualifiers on medication ads.
[deleted]
All of your alarm is founded on the assumption that the shirt is *general* advice, intended to apply to all. I question that assumption, as one could also take the shirt as being just about the person wearing it. I've said this five different ways, but you seem either unwilling or unable to understand it.

Re: homeopathy and meditation, there is plenty of research showing benefits of meditation. Not so much for homeopathy.
[deleted]
And once again, you seem unwilling to see that the shirt could be just about the people for whom, in objective fact, medication is bad and meditation is good!
Because they are uneducated.  That is what makes it dangerous.   

You look good. Keep moving! :)
It's a good place to start. You're a handsome chap, you got this! 
Very nice!
It's hard to look at yourself lovingly, knowing all your faults. Congrats on being strong enough to face those things!
Looking well pal
Good on you, you're going to go further than you could imagine. This is your first step, congrats for taking it. The world is at your doorstep and you took your biggest step of opening that door. Step by step, you're going to get out into that great big world and own it. You really can do anything. 

And as someone suffering with mental illnesses, I congratulate you again, and thank you for showing me it is possible to take those tiny positive baby steps forward when you're in a rut.

So from a stranger halfway around the world, thanks for being a bit of inspiration I needed when I was feeling hopeless.

You've got this man. You're gonna get through this. I believe in you.

🐭🌈💚
I want to hug you !
I think you're handsome!! 
> avoiding myself

This hits really close to home. Good luck!
You look good man, go hit the gym, get a haircut and you'll look even better!
Don't avoid yourself. You're beautiful. Love yourself fully so you. And be loved fully. 
If ever you need someone to talk to, I'm here man.
You look great! It's not about what you actually look like if depression turns what you see into something that is not there. Objectively: you are a good looking guy!
You look connected to yourself.  Just the impression from looking at the photo.  
You have very confident eyes.
Thank you, I really appreciate that. It's been feeling like the  scene from What About Bob... Baby steps on the bus
It's all about the baby steps. We take the giant leaps when we're ready. But baby step away, because no matter how small that step is, you are moving forward. And that's an achievement.

So I hope one day you'll look back at this picture and realise that this baby step, was actually the biggest step you took. Because it was your first.

Congratulations.

And may you find many aspects, features, quirks, and perks about yourself, because I know there are a lot more there waiting for you to discover 🌈🐭💚
No joke that movie is on TV right now. I'd never seen it and I am watching it right now!

that is amazing. i love the sentiment; not only does she care enough to go through the work to make this, but also is conveying the message that you are equipped to handle whatever the struggle is. not alot of people get that from a parent, so this is touching. 
I am in no way religious myself, but the meaning behind something like this is so amazing. It's wonderful you have a mother who spent time to make you something so deep to try and help you see light in the darkness. Very beautiful indeed
I love this, very thoughtful.

It's amazing when anyone does anything this thoughtful to show though they do not fully know your experience they want to help and support you but means so much when it's a parent.

I love to think of analogies or things outside/beyond me that I can use to help me fight; this is a great one.

I attended Church of Wales' (Christian) schools in the United Kingdom but my parents were quite relaxed. Although I've moved away from religion myself, I admire the teachings of love for one another, charity etc., great values for anyone to have.

It's been quite a journey with my parents and although they may never fully "understand" it means the world to me that they try.

Use what you have, ask for help and take it, keep fighting and stay strong.
Your mom is awesome
This is awesome
Support for evidence-based therapy would have helped you more.
This is such a great gift.
Allow yourself to pass all anxiety and worry onto your warrior, allow him to carry your stresses for you so you dont have to, this can be therapeutic. A
Happy Cakeday!



This is great :) You should draw a happy wolf! I love happy wolves 
These are awesome! Put them on a t shirt!
Love this!
These are great and so uplifting! You should be proud :)
I know this is a coping mechanism, and a damn fine one!, but this is also an idea for a great handmade product line; you should sell these!

Nothing is more fulfilling than when a creative hobby can also be one that supports you financially!

Beat of luck - great art!
Nice job, OP. You should be proud. I paint too to cope with depression and anxiety but usually of plants and landscapes.

Inspired by a thread from the other day, can you draw a [baby ray with a darn big smile] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5r0al2/zoo_keepers_of_reddit_what_is_the_funniest_animal/dd46268/ )?
These are absolutely amazing, thank you so much for sharing! They're so vibrant and they really made me smile.

I'd love to be able to make something so beautiful, well done. Keep creating and keep coping! 
Talent! You should sell these on Etsy.
This is probably much healthier than stress eating
I wish I had the talent to draw! This is beautiful 
These are stunning and so wholesome - thank you. 
Thank you for posting. That puffin genuinely lifted my spirits.
These are beautiful. Thanks so much for sharing them!
Wow, that's awesome! When will you put it into a book?

Loved this , i also draw things too
Great idea! Thank you! 
Thanks for your kind words. I don't think I have the time or energy to set up an online store for any of my work just yet, but I'm honoured you'd suggest that. I'm curious though - what sort products would you like to see the critters on? 

Great idea! Thank you for your kind comment :) 
That story made me smile so much. Thank you for the nice comment, I'll do my best! 
I don't think I have the time or energy to set up an online store for any of my work just yet, but I'm honoured you'd suggest that. :) 
You could try redbubble for it, but I don't know much about the process.

This is definitely something that I'd love to have as a print.
I think it would be great on simple canvas! They almost remind me of disney illustration, or for a lids book. They are warm; i like that.

I completely understand where you're coming from regarding time and energy. I got into woodworking by accident when i discovered i am handy and working with powertools was therapeutic, and i was entirely overwhelmed at the beginning....and still am.

Keep that option in your back pocket, you never know when you'll have the time, but its always worth a shot!
You're welcome. :)

Medication can be a useful resource, but most people walk into it with the wrong idea. They don't realize it's a supplement to Therapy, exercise, behavioral skills, and Journaling. Moreover, most people don't realize that after 3-5 months if a med is not working you should try another med. Which sucks, but it can help. 
"Make my medicine and give it to me for free or I'll kill myself and others."
I needed help to function again and stabilise my moods so I can start therapy... I'll have to be on meds for the next 5-10 years still but it's better than nothing. Again, I'm starting therapy once I'm stable and once school is over. In terms of money, I'm just lucky mum works at a pharmacy that stocks mostly psychiatric meds. Didn't have to pay too much.

Here is a link to a crisis text line. It is very easy, and you will be linked to a real person who am help you work through some of these thoughts. You can text them about anything. 
I still can't belive that you guys have to pay for your medication.
what is it that makes some Americans proud about having to pay for medication generally? it's a shame really
The bigger problem is getting people to take their meds whether they are free or not.
Nothing is free. 
So many reactionary shit-bags preaching against "muh free shit" for a mental health sub-reddit.
Meds don't magically solve everything. Many times it's a placebo.
If you can't afford your meds you need to reach out for help, be it from friends and family or government assistance. Whatever state or country you are in, there should be SOME sort of government or state programs to help you cover the cost-if not get your meds for free. This post reads as very threatening and I don't find it very funny. 
Mental illness is real but medication IS NOT the answer.  It can be a useful tool but it is certainly not a supplement!   If you believe taking a pill is the answer to stress, anxiety and depression your are misinfromed.  These meds can create the symptoms of depression and make you agitated and then you switch to another med then a few years later another perhaps a combo of 2 or more. 

Meanwhile all this time you truly never dealt with your issues and its 15 years later. Trying to wean or stop these meds is worse then a valium dependence!   

Please people find a good therapist you will be amazed what a non biased opinion to your situation can teach you. 

From someone who tasted the pharmaceutical rainbow it comes with uncertain life changing consequences which outweigh the good it does.

IMO!
Fact! Chemical imbalance is a theory!  
The best that could happen is that they or their helpers could figure out that those who claim that radical dietary changes can greatly help most mental illnesses are not lying.  The worst that can happen is that they could kill themselves or others.  A big problem is that some meds for some people will cause them to kill themselves or others.  Meds are no guarantee that everyone will be safe; but they are guaranteed to make you feel sort of off and other unpleasant side effects.
I've been looking as meds as a way to get stable enough to begin to do the work necessary to get better. 
Some people can't get significantly better with therapy or other forms of help than meds because they really just have chemical imbalances and whatnot — but I totally get you. Especially when it comes to acute depression and anxiety, meds should be used as a crutch to get you back on feet while therapy/whatever else that works for you does its work of giving you permanent keys to get out of the ditch.
I take my tabbies for anxiety and depression... but the thought of going to some random, talking about my life and problems and considering HOW TO PAY FOR ONGOING THERAPY makes me feel even worse. So I just take the meds. 
Yeah I was gonna say, I'm in favor of socialized healthcare but the OP words it like a threat. 
You have to pay for medication in The UK too, it's about £7.50 each time you collect your prescription.


Nothing is free but the rich can and should pay for what the poor need but can't afford. At least, that's my opinion and probably OP's too. We end up repaying the state what we owe once we get out of poverty.
Let me tell you about how wrong you are with your comment of
"Meds are no guarantee that everyone will be safe; but they are guaranteed to make you feel sort of off and other unpleasant side effects."
If meds make you feel off; you are on the wrong meds. 
If you have unpleasant side effects; you need to talk to you doctor about them.
Due to stuff that has happened in my life I ran out of refills and have been without my meds for about a month and let me tell you I "feel off" now more than I did when I was on them. My anxiety is bouncing around more than a superball dropped from a sky scrapper. No matter what I eat, what exercises I do; everything is off. My brain chemistry is off. My brain does not make enough of one or more chems it needs for my mind to be balanced. A nice healthy green salad is not going to help that, nor does going for a run. 
Just, no.
Are you saying diet > therapy > meds? Or is it more of a follow a healthy food lifestyle and a healthy mind comes about kind of thing? 
For the record, meds are not guaranteed to make you feel sort of off. Not all meds have unpleasant side effects. Not all consumers feel all or any of those side effects. 
Now Dr. Oz, please go back to read a medical journal and don't spout so much opinionated conjecture. 
That's my thought too, I find that I am in a much better mood generally when I am able to exercise regularly but sometimes I am unable to do so and my mood crashes awfully. 
I'm in the same boat. Starting therapy next year once I'm stable and school is over
Good on you. 
sometimes you need permanent meds too. Its a case by case thing! 
He or she is not a random. He or she is a trained professional who is bound by state, federal and local law to keep your secrets. that is if they are doing their job right. 
It's more of a loaded question than it is a threat... but a legitimate question,  neverthless.
£8.60, and only in England. The rest of the UK gets them without paying a charge.
Starting a discussion here, not a fight. And I'm playing devil's advocate for the sake of it. 

There's an argument to be made that if you/the government pays for everything a man needs, there is no incentive to find a job or work. There is a natural element of laziness to people, myself included. If someone hands me the basics to what I need to survive, without me having to go to work at all, what is the incentive for someone? Not all people think like that, but there are certainly a great many people who would rather stay in moderate poverty and be paid for, than rise up and have to conceptually pay it back. 

That being said, my point was not let's just let poor people starve. It's just something to think about, looking at all sides of the issue. And again, this was for the sake of a discussion, not an internet argument. 

EDIT: Also consider that method from the perspective of the wealthy. There is no such thing as a free lunch, someone always has to pay, somehow. 
Yeah I was going to say something similar. I'm going on meds soon because after years of healthy diet and plenty of exercise, I don't feel any better
Uh yeah that's literally what the first sentence of my comment said :P
And therapy is a system of evidence-based techniques implemented by said professional, not just venting/talking with no point or goals. 
I didn't know that it was only England that paid the surcharge!  Thanks! 
Well if you re-read my message, I was in no way suggesting we pay for everything the poor needs. Simply, when people are forced to go off their meds because they can't afford them, they suffer a great impact to their well-being and may even have to take days off work or put off looking for work or cancel a job interview or whatever. Withdrawal effects from antidepressants and other meds for psychological conditions are very very hard to handle for some molecules. It compromises the efficacy of treatment and, on the long run, their ability to contribute to the economical health of their society. It's in the best interest of everyone that those who need meds, therapy, and things like that get them when they need them if they can't afford to pay for them, so they can get back on their feet.

I also explicitly said that the rich would have to pay, I know "free" things have a cost.

I am well aware that there is an ongoing theory that full on communism leads to work apathy, though this is just theory, it has not been proven. (I don't think neither the USSR nor Mao's communism qualify as proper communism.) But communism is not what I'm suggesting either here, just giving help (or at least some help) to those who need it to get by. The fact is, the US has almost twice the rate of Canada in terms of deaths by starvation, and trice Sweden's rate. ([Source](http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/malnutrition/by-country/)) You're not advocating for people to starve to death, but this is what happens.
Something is amiss, and it isn't because you are deficient in pharmaceuticals.  I would try to fix it before I did meds.  I am going to bet that your definition of a "healthy diet" is not what your body actually needs.  Too much dependence upon what experts say and now you are again depending upon experts by taking their meds.  I would think that thinking for yourself with the tremendous resource of the Internet would be a better idea.
I know I was parroting/agreeing with you friend! 
YOu are highly misinformed
Yeah, but I am cured and happy and getting along with others.  And before I wasn't.  And I didn't use pharmaceuticals, so I don't have any side effects and I don't have to be concerned about any future problems with what pharmaceuticals now  could do to me in the future.     

How are you doing?

Thank you for posting this and making me smile.

I agree. A superpower for the depressed would probably be humility.

You have a twinkle in your eye. Nurture that until all of you glows. You can do it. I believe in you.
I am so proud of you - keep up the good work, friend! 
You are a handsome young lad! Congrats!
You have a very kind smile 😊 
Keep your head up, you're doing great! 
Be kind to yourself. 
I am so proud of you, friend <3
Good for you! You have lovely eyes!
Stay strong you are great!

Shit.... Hits home real hard... Couldn't describe it any better really...
That's spot on.  This is how I feel all the time and I couldn't have said it better.
and every once in a while, the current slows, or the water gets shallow. You get a chance to move forward, and maybe catch up with others. They still look at you funny, but are relieved you're "finally catching up." 

Then you move forward, and you think "I can do this." You wade to the bank. You feel like you're almost there...

...but it's farther than you thought. And the water gets a little deeper, rougher. And as you try to get through it, moving forward, the water is back to where it was a moment ago - maybe rougher. 

obviously I do not know you,  and I have been up for 34 hours on molly but regardless hang tough,  try not to borrow your happiness from later with drugs like me.

When we are flush we are flush,  when we are bust we are bust

These are so beautiful. The love is so evident in every word. I am incredibly jealous. No one wrote to me in the psych ward.. You have a wonderful gift in this person who cares so much for you.

TRANSCRIBED:

>DAY 1:
>Dear ███,
>We watched hours of Orphan Black and Master Chef yesterday. I could tell your body was lounging on my couch but your mind was elsewhere. I wish I could soothe your mind, bring it back to my couch, nurture it, heal it, be its crutch even when you don’t want it. I wish I were able to better navigate this tight rope separating my own selfish desire to “help” you by imposing myself upon you and letting you do your own thing, whether it be staggenng (?) haggardly (?) or expinng (?).
>Regardless, I ♥ you!

>DAY 2:
>Dear ███,
>Today we almost got attacked by the demented sprinkler system but instead we scraped by and welcomed the residual mist on this warm evening. You were quieter today, more reserved and less talkative. Unwilling to force conversation, I doodled on your arms and thought about how I only ever see you this often when you’re in the psych ward. Am I being selfish for forcing my presence upon you in my lame attempt to mask my need to go through the motions with this image of “supporting” you? I can’t tell what you want or need from me, and it’s killing me.
>~E

>DAY 3:
>Dear ███,
>Today I was unable to visit you because I had to force myself to stay home and catch up on errands, so much to Har’s dismay, he was bathed and clipped. I also haven’t been making enough progress on my thesis to warrant a visit to you. I am trying to prioritize my thesis above visiting you, but it’s proving harder than I thought. I can’t seem to divorce my guilt from not visiting you from my need of the extra time to write. But I’m trying because my visiting you while worrying about my lack of progress is not enjoyable for you either. I know that I can do it; I just don’t like how I have to choose between you and my thesis. I hope I can see you soon.
>♥, LN

>DAY 4:
>Dear ███,
>Today your papa drove all of us to you in your guys’ fancy new car that doesn’t have the spaceship seatbelts. Your papa brought pictures of you when you were younger (ie pre-me), which you flipped through while I decorated your bun (8/10 rating) with a grass flower crown. I rather like doting on you  I often find myself wishing we could go back to the times of 2686, because I thought that we were happier. But now I realize that really, only I was happy in my ignorance. I realize that we can’t ever go back, that things will be different now because mental health isn’t something that can be stowed away in a time capsule and forgotten. So…the future is going to be a BITCH.

>DAY 5:
>Dear ███,
>Today I didn’t visit but hopefully I’ll get enough done on my thesis to warrant a visit tomorrow! And if that doesn’t happen, maybe I’ll get to see you in your apartment on Monday! I know that your getting discharged doesn’t mean you’re magically cured, but to me it’ll mean you won the battle this time. And I’ll celebrate that. Because that’s all that I can do: celebrate these small victories with you. I wish I could do more, but I know I can’t, which is probably the hardest thing that I still trying to come to terms with. But I know that I have to accept it, otherwise I’ll be stuck in misery, which definitely won’t help you. I have different friends for different purposes; for example, my labmates for their expertise and going out (though that’s rare now), ______ for her humor and motivation, ___ for her Asian-ness and her emotional acuteness. And I realize you have different people for different needs too. But I wanted to satisfy all your needs, so not I’m struggling to accept that I can’t.

>DAY 6:
>Dear ███,
>Today I baked a batch of chocolate chip cookies that were supposed to turn out super fluffy as perfect ice cream sandwich material, buuut my baking soda must be reaching the last of its days because I pulled out one GIANT baking sheet-sized cookie out of the oven. The cookie, however, was probably the best chocolate chip cookie I’ve ever made. I’ll have to make them again when you’re out. I keep wanting to send you snaps of them but then realize you won’t see them. I don’t like not being able to access you constantly. Like just the fact that I can’t text you whenever really bothers me, even though we’ve definitely gone longer without texting each other. Hurry and get out so I can try these snapchat face filters with you!
>~E

>DAY 7:
>Dear ███,
>It’s already been a week?! I hope you’ve made more progress on your mental health that I have made on my thesis, particularly because today was a trainwreck of a day. But somehow, you’ve still managed to save my day, even when you aren’t here. It’s a long story. I’m sure I’ll explain it to you, because in retrospect, it was kind of hilarious. It mostly sucks because I lost a whole day and thus lost the privilege to go visit you. I hate prioritizing my thesis above you. It feels so wrong. I’m trying to tell myself that writing my thesis will help you too because then I can go visit, but I can’t seem to act upon that logic. And then things like today happen and set me back even further and widen the gap between you and me. I can’t seem to win this came.
>~E

>DAY 8:
>Dear ███,
>Today I called you because I wanted to check in with you after not visiting for 4 days…but who’s counting? For some reason, time drags out longer when you’re at the psych ward; 4 days where you’re there feels like an eternity, but somehow I’ve gone 4 weeks without contacting you while you were living your normal life. It was so good to hear your revelation today. I could tell you were more…optimistic about your plan of action, and that makes my heard swell  I’ve been rooting for itty bitty ███ and now all the will power (or whatever you want to call it) she can muster. I know that itty bitty ███’s journey won’t be easy, for you or for me, but itty bitty ███ is worth the hardship!
>~E

>DAY 9:
>Dear ███,
>I really miss talking to you. Anytime I start to delve into my darker austere logic with anyone else, I scare people, or make them worried. I hate their worry more than their fear. Like today I was talking to someone about how I don’t know if it’s worth it for us humans to be able to feel happy if that also means we can feel so much pain. Particularly because animals in general are wired to respond more effectively to negative stimuli. So for every 1 unit of pain, you need like 3 units of happiness to make having an emotional capacity worth it. The odds are not in our favor, yet for some odd reason humans are constantly fighting for happiness, or maybe my math is wrong. I make stupid mistakes all the time and I actually hope this is one of them.
>~E

That's really sweet.
I have so many friends but I can't think of one person who would do something like this for me. Sometimes I wonder if it would be better to just have one really close friend that I could actually talk to rather than trying to maintain three different groups of friends.
A true friend!
You're lucky to have them OP! And I gather from their letters that they believe the same of you :) all the best!
This is touching and beautiful.
That's an amazing friend. Wishing both of you the best.

I didn't even realize it was out! I know nothing about this game and I'm buying it right now. I've played and loved all the other Mass Effect games so I'm excited. I needed a game like this to come out. 
I've often thought that more entertainment should be educational as well as fun, so the audience always goes away smarter as a result of it. This is a great example of that, so well done to the Mass Effect team.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

It has about the same pacing as mass effect 1. A lot of story. I have gone hours between combat time just talking to NPCs and so on. 
It's a really good game. It gets a lot of hate because of the rabid fan base, but I liked it. Sure, the animations aren't great during conversations, but I'm 32 and grew up with a gameboy so it looks amazing to me. Ha
Awesome! That's exactly what I'm looking for. Can't wait to get home and download it. 
Same.   I am still used to reading the text for all dialog.  
Haha yep I'm 26 and also remember finding an original gameboy over my aunts house when I was a kid and it all started from there. Played through my parents old NES, played those incredible Zelda games in the late 90's (Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask) on the N64 with my mom. Nostalgia!!! 

I left it to download last night because my internet is a bit slow, but something got messed up so now I'm home and had to continue the download since it paused for some reason after I left last night. I'm on PC and it says I can start playing when the game is 43% downloaded. 
Soon you get to play alien sudoko !
Haha that sounds so cool

@FoulVowel Before I let you go, this tattoo is for myself and for my patients. In no way do I need to consult others before I choose to advocate for something that I believe in. The mental health professionals that you suggest I leave the advice to, they're my colleagues. I am a mental health professional, seems to me that I am giving advice with your approved credentials! 

Happy Monday! 😊
That was lovely. May I ask about your semicolon tattoo? Just wondering if there's anything more to it? 

Edit: Sorry I remembered not long after posting what the tattoo is about. I'm glad you're in that place. I think I might get one of those soon when I'm ready to be in that position. 

Edit 2: just for other who may be wondering. http://www.pennlive.com/living/index.ssf/2015/07/little_semicolon.html
I really needed to read this today. Ive never felt as low as my current dip, but I needed this. Thankyou
The world needs more people like you.  Thank you :)
You have no idea how much those first two sentences meant to read.
Thank you so much.
What are these good days you speak off? I only have bad days and really bad days.
that's nice of you, though I politely disagree about the 'non contagious' statement. sure, it is non contagious perhaps from a biological perspective (probably most conditions), but from a behavioral viewpoint it certainly is. violence for instance spreads like a virus whether the source is a mental health problem or other. violence in itself can cause many mental health issues for the receiver which can include spreading violence further.  
So those unmedicated Bi-Polar Schizophrenics really aren't shaped by their mental illness?  Same with those BPD Narcissists?  Yeah, I'm sure that it really doesn't play a big part in who they are.  

Lady, you tattooed a big ass semi-colon on yourself.  For what reason I cannot even begin to fathom.  I can't help but think that you might have not done that if you mental illness was under control.  

Please continue to attempt to control your mental illness.   Perhaps you should let the mental health professionals dispense the mental health advice.  I suggest asking some people what they think about a tattoo before getting one.  

"Semicolon?  I'd either go full colon or just say fuck it and go with an Interrobang".  
I wanna be like you. For real. I'd probably flipped my shit if someone was that snarky to me, and you just smile at them. That's wonderful.
Your my hero! Keep being awesome and advocating for people like me.
And by the way, your tattoo is awesome. I have on my wrist next to a "failed attempt scar" to remind myself that my story isn't over and that scar is the proof!
I am studying to be a mental health professional and I so admire your perspective and grace. Thank you for being a wonderful model for future this future counselor. 


Thank you for sharing the link! And I so encourage you to advocate for what you believe in, whether that be by getting a tattoo or not! 
I'm glad I could help :) Shoot me a message if you ever need anything! 
No, thank you! I appreciate the kind words :) 
You're so very welcome!!! Write them down somewhere, like a planner or journal of some sort, so you always have something to reference on the bad days! That's what helps me! 
I know what you're saying! I was there once too, for myself I really pushed to find the good in every situation. I was reaching sometimes, but it really helped me to change my mindset and how I viewed the things that were out of my control. 
That's a great point! 
However, I'm talking about the stigma that surrounds individuals struggling with mental health disorders. The thought of some that they cannot associate with people who struggle with mental health because they think they'll "catch" depression, suicidal thoughts/tendencies or whatever disorder it may be. 
Thanks for your input! It won't be taken into consideration when continuing to practice what I believe in, but your opinion is still welcome! 
You sound like you're really struggling. I hope you get the help that you need.
/u/FoulVowel sounds like they're ranting, and I'm not sure what about, but I gotta admit I read this post and thought, "well she left out BPD, schizo, and a boat load of others in that statement. Cool." Just sayin. Inclusivity, not exclusivity.
Haha, thank you! It's taken me a long time to get to a place of not blowing up on people and staying level headed! For myself, I would never want to sink to the level of belittling a person for their beliefs, so that's what guides me in my responses! 
Thank you, thank you!!!! 
I love that! I hope you're in a better place and am so glad that you're using your previous experiences to continue forward! 
Good luck!!! It's an amazing career field, filled with even more amazing individuals and clients/patients! 
Thanks! I'm glad to share it, I think it has a beautiful message. One that perhaps might be difficult to describe to people without insight but is actually one of real positivity. I'm very glad you reminded me of it. Thank you! :) 
Thank you so much! May just take you up on that offer :') 
i agree, plus the stigma creates shame for the person with the disorder, which is a problem in itself. 
I'm all about inclusivity! I didn't have enough characters to outline every single mental illness, but you're totally right! Inclusivity, not exclusivity! 
Definitely! There's so much negativity around disorders, in general, that so many people go undiagnosed and won't seek treatment just because they don't want to carry around that stigma! 

I've had feelings like that for many years
What if there is no "used to enjoy" or "usual energy"
Thanks for helping verify the fact that i am depressed. Because I feel everything on that list
"and/or increasing drug use"?

I love that they naturally assume all of the students are on at least a *little* but of drugs.
So now we know, what do we do about it?
Damn. This was my life for over 10 years before I got back into treatment. 
Well...nothing new to me there. 
I thought I was out, but it just keeps pulling me back in. 
oops
Ergh. Me too
Probably means its ongoing depression rather than a depressive episode
same here
Isn't that awful. I think many of us do. Why though, when many of us also do have good things in our lives. I know I do, objectively, but inside it's like it makes no difference. Ugh. 
Agreed it is easy to notice when things are wrong, but yet so hard for many of to stop and notice how good things really are. My main reason for feeling the way i do is the lose of so many ppl that were close to me in the past 10 yrs.  first my brother ten years ago this year, my favorite uncle 7 yrs ago and my father this yr. death seems to surround me.  

You're a hell of an artist.

I understand this is a coping method, but this is the type of art i appreciate. Mostly because it must take so much courage to publish it.

The raw emotion (for lack of a better word) is apparent; its truly powerful to see the manifestations of one's mind. Its like...looking through a window into someone else's world.
A few folks are asking direct questions or complimenting OP... pretty sure the OP just posted this because it's really a cool article. First person was used in the original title of the article. The OP was not trying to represent his or herself as Kate. 
Hah,this is exactly what I do,I have Schizo-affective or Schizophrenia dependent on psychiatrist...but I'm nowhere near as good as you are at drawing 👍
Thank you for sharing!  These are wonderful... learning about other peoples hallucinations fascinates me.  I was diagnosed with psychotic depression years ago, but my experiences are much different than that of someone with schizophrenia.  I always wonder why it is that hallucinations aren't more friendly, or why voices say hurtful things.  Is your fly a friendly character, or is his only purpose to torment you?  And what does the Messiah do when he appears? 
wow this was so awesome and eye-opening. I studied psychology and am getting my master's in mental health counseling, but it's so very different reading a textbook and then seeing someone who actually has the disorder use their real-life coping methods. I have somewhat debilitating anxiety and wish I had half her talent!! It would make life a lot easier to be able to just get it all out sometimes. Thanks for sharing this article, I just followed her on instagram and she seems like such a strong, talented girl
Wonderful art! Birdie is interesting to me, she seems to be a positive force in your art. 
I wish my schizophrenia was profitable or at least made me really smart and artistic. 
These are spectacular, you're a great artist. I'm glad to hear you've found a way of coping. 
I've tried drawing my hallucinations but I can never represent them accurately enough. Maybe if I was more artistic. I've tried to draw some before to show people what I experience but it doesn't do it justice.
You cute. Stay strong 
"Why are the cute ones always crazy!?"

On a serious note, it sounds like a great hobby and also a great distraction from the disease too. Keep going!
>  folks are asking direct questions or complimenting OP..

I'm glad at least 1 person here figured this out...
Oh. :-/
Oh oops, I thought that as well.  Thanks for clarifying.    
I know it's morbid, I just always wondered. I've tried to take my life before and only one of my friends really cared. My parents and sister were obviously upset but I don't mean that I mean does it really have a huge impact on some people? Like is there anyone on here that's had someone close to them commit suicide and knows what it's like. I just feel selfish but I want to know because I wouldn't want to upset the people closest to me or make anyone else do it 
OP, for the longest time, I absolutely hated a distant friend of mine for taking her own life. After being missing for three days, her dad found her in their shed, hanging from the roof. The sheer grief it caused her family and our community was tangible. Damn, I could barely look as the coffin was lowered, so I was looking around the gathered people. The clawing movement her mum made as the casket was lowered, as if there was something she could do to bring her back... She had to be held back by her partner. That image is something that will stay with me the rest of my days as the picture of grief.

After the initial sorrow, I was furious. How could she not think of those around her? Her mum, who was willing to throw herself into that pit on the barest glimmer that she was alive? Her dad, who worked tirelessly to keep her and the rest of the family sheltered and fed, but still found time play soccer with the kids out front or set up the make shift water slide in the summer? Her siblings? Her other friends? Me? How could she squander something as precious as life when so many where denied it?

It took years, and a lot more maturity to understand, that it wasn't selfishness that guided her actions. She honestly thought that the lives of those around her would be improved by her not being there. If she was dead, she couldn't be a disappointment. If she was gone, she couldn't fail. If she died, she couldn't lose the fight anymore. She could stop fighting.

If she'd even caught a glimpse of her mum's face, pale and tear-strained, clawing through the air towards her casket, I don't think she'd have dreamed about doing it. It took me years, and going through a few bouts of it myself, to realize that depression firmly gripped her in that moment, and that moment was all it took.

Now, when I look back and think about her, I can see a scared girl, tired of constantly failing and doing what she'd convinced herself to be an act of love. I have a strange mind when it comes to things like this and think in analogies, so please bear with the oddity. I look back at Sam and I see a girl fighting a horrendous monster alone, so caught in the fight and the beating she's getting that she doesn't see the weapons and armour her loved ones where holding out for her. So large was the creature she didn't see that she didn't have to fight alone. It drew the air from her lungs and she didn't have the words to tell her closest folks she was in trouble. They all have their own battles and shouldn't have to fight hers. It's hard, so very hard to push through that, to reach out, but you have to, for them.

So there's one less person trying to tear through the air, through to the afterlife just to embrace their loved one's again.

You don't have to fight alone OP. Your family cares. Your friends care. Your teachers and relatives care. Everyone who has contact with you would feel the hole you leave behind. Dammit, I care. Take the armour. Take the weapons and take a breather. You don't have to beat it right now. Recharge, breathe deep and go again tomorrow. There are so many sources available.

Breathe. In and out. You can do it. Make yourself something warm, boot up a laptop and have a google and a phone to hand. Take the first step, take the armour, take the weapons, and tell people you might need a hand with this beastie. There's no shame in that.

Reach out OP. You got this. 

Don't be Sam.

Don't let someone else be Sam's mum.
Of course they'd care. I dont know you and I care. You will be ending your own pain but causing so much for those you leave behind. My brother in law committed suicide in 2014. It devastated me and I don't think its something ill ever be over. To know he felt that the best option was to end his life breaks my heart. I loved him very much, he had good family lots of friends. But for his own reasons he did not want to live. He had depression and other mental health problems and i don't blame him or think he's selfish for wanting to go and making that decision. It would be unfair to expect sometime to keep living a life they don't want to live anymore.. But im also sad that the friendships and love we had for him weren't enough for him to want to keep living. 
I had two relatives of mine complete suicides about three decades ago.

I'm still upset.

I still can't shake the feeling that I should have seen or done something.

I still shed tears when I look at their portraits.

I don't really share this story much but I feel it's important. I was very depressed and had constant anxiety. I used to think my friends and family hated me and constantly talk behind my back I had also failed many times and thought I the the most disappointing child my parents had and it ate me up inside. I couldn't talk to any one over the fear of being called crazy or someone telling me how other people are suffering much more. 

One day after failing another test at school I was done without even realising it. I starting having suicidal thoughts for a few days and actually thought of a good way of dying, it took me some time to realise what I was actually thinking about and it scared the crap out of me and I decided I NEEDED to talk to some one.

I decided to talk to my teacher and told him everything I was feeling and thought of over the past year and looking back today the signs of worry showed clearly on his face but I didn't see it back then. I expected him to get angry or tell me how unimportant my feelings where but instead me just said that he understood. We talked a little more and he invited me to a hike he has every year with his wife, I accepted and asked him not to tell my parents.

That one day, changed my life, we drove to the place and had a very nice talk and his wife was very pleasant. The spot was in the middle of no where surrounded by nature. It was beautiful! As we walked he would ask me to listen to the he birds and the sound of the water, would ask me to observe the light shining through the trees and in all honesty I had never seen the world like I did until that day but nothing compared to what I saw at the top of the big Hill.  We reached the top and looking at the land below was beyond amazing and he told me how his dad brought him to this place when he was a kid and how it made him realise that the world was full of beautiful and not everything was dark and horrible, I started looking at the world differently and can never thank him enough of what he did. Lost contact with him after I graduated but I can never forget him.
Hello, I just wanted to say that I'm overwhelmed by the amount of beautiful souls on Reddit that have taken the time to send me messages and have left such positive replies. I made this Reddit account yesterday just because I wanted answers to one question and when I woke up today I couldn't believe how popular my post had gotten and I'm still a little baffled. 
This community truly is amazing I couldn't have gotten this much support through even 10 more years of therapy it's just so refreshing to hear a nothing persons point of view on the subject. 
So once again thank you all so much for your help I feel so much better :) 
I feel like this post should always be here or there on the site just incase someone is in the same position as myself so they can come across it and cry like I did and take a while to think things through.

So many people will care. Having recently witnessed firsthand the impact of a dear friend's suicide on his family, I can promise you, they will care. It will effect even more people than you can begin to imagine. When I went home for the funeral and to support my friend's family, my dad held me and sobbed and sobbed just at the mere thought of losing me or my siblings and just imagining the depth of pain his parents were experiencing. No parent should ever have to bury their child, but especially due to suicide. There is no way to cope with the fact that your child actually wanted to die. 

Believe me. I was dealing with suicidal thoughts for a few months before my friend died. Just imagining the pain my parents would feel has guilted me enough to not want to die. I don't think that guilt is a good or healthy motivators for most things, but if it keeps you alive, use it. Use it until you can find more reasons to stay. 

Please, OP. Stay alive. People care. I promise. 
Yes, people would care. People would be distraught, devastated.

The reason that I know is that I almost died in an accident, and I experienced first hand how people around me reacted. I was never suicidal, but before my accident, I had sometimes wondered whether my life or death would make much of a difference. I'm married but with no children, didn't feel very close to my family, and didn't feel that I had many friends. I thought that if I died suddenly, a few people would be sad for a little while, but they'd soon get over it. I just assumed that my death wouldn't make much of an impact.

Then one day while on vacation in a foreign country, I fell and broke my neck. One moment I was fine, the next, I was a quadriplegic. I was thousands of miles from home, flat on my back, paralyzed, and helpless. 

As horrible as it was, the experience taught me a lot. First and foremost, after being with my husband for over 25 years, I finally learned how much he really loves me. I half-expected him to leave me, but he didn't. He stayed with me and helped me to adjust to my life as a disabled person. It's 10 years later now, and he's still with me, helping me get through every day.

Secondly, my family and my husband's family pulled together and rallied around me. Everyone pitched in and helped, each contributing based on their own skill set to help me get my life back together. Family members that had not been on speaking terms for years put aside their differences in their commitment to helping me. My own relationships with family members became closer than they'd been in years as I came to appreciate how much they all love me.

Finally, the outpouring of love and support from friends and acquaintances was astonishing. I had no idea that I had so many friends who genuinely care about me.

My point is this--I think that most of us are unaware of how much the people around us truly care about us. And we get so caught up in our day-to-day lives that we fail to let our loved ones know how much we care about them. But we do care deeply about them, and they care just as deeply about us. Unfortunately, it sometimes takes a disaster to shake us up and get us to actually let people know how we feel.

So whenever you're feeling alone, unimportant, or unloved, please understand that none of those things are true. Think of all the people you care about, and realize that they also care about you even if they haven't said so recently. Then try to reach out to them and let them know how you feel.
I had a really good friend.  I thought he was fun to hang around with.  He was smart and talented in many areas.  He wasn't super funny himself but he laughed at my jokes, so that shows he had a great sense of humour.

After college he moved to another city a couple hours away and we only saw each other every couple months as adult life started to kind of take over our spare time, but between me and a couple other friends in our circle we all saw him regularly.  Two of us went and visited him for a week just before his birthday.

He was living with another old friend of ours from high-school and we all had a good time.  We went and harassed him at his record store job and he took us around town to some of the cool spots.  We went clubbing and walked all the way back to his place after we missed the last buses.

On the day of his birthday we had already planned to head back home due to other commitments so we sang him happy birthday, had a bunch of hugs, and started to head back.  We stopped off downtown with his roommates to pick up some gifts for his birthday that the roommates would take home for him.  Then we drove across the big bridge and headed back to our town.

That night our phone rang.  It was his brother across the country.  Our friend had jumped off the very bridge we drove over to leave town.  After a short investigation a few days later it turned out that the coroner put the time of his death at *about the same time as we were crossing the damn bridge*.

It took quite a while to get over his death.

The point of my story here though is that this was *20 years ago* and I *still* think of him regularly.  REGULARLY.  I see a new technology arise and think about how he would have felt about it.  All kinds of things make me remember him.  I don't feel the sadness the same way any more but I definitely still miss him.  I can't even begin to imagine how his parents must feel, or his brother, but they were a nice family so I imagine they must have the same lingering gap in their lives.  He didn't leave any notes or anything so no one really knows why he did it.  Completely baffling to this day.

One thing I have always had a hard time with is that he didn't say anything to us.  He didn't put out any clear signs or ask for help at all.  He DIDN'T EVEN GIVE US A CHANCE to help him.  I've always been a little pissed about that part because there was lots we could have done to make changes and we were all so goddamn young.  So young.  Life changes.  I never gave a ton of thought to how my life would work out, I have always kind of just bounced along letting things take me where they may, for good or bad.  I am sure it would have been great to have him along for the ride.

Please consider giving people a chance to help you.  Please consider how things really do change as you get older, even if you don't think so now.  Please give yourself a chance.
There's a man who recently died, one I literally hoped for years would die. He was an arrogant man. My friend was in a relationship with him and he was overbearing, often unreasonable, and controlling. I loved this man's parents, I loved his girlfriend, I loved many of his friends. I loved a lot of people who loved him. After he killed himself, myself and quite a few others felt relief (privately). When people expressed what a great man he was, we rolled our eyes amongst ourselves and quietly agreed that death didn't make someone a good person.

What I learned was that you don't have to be a good person to be incredibly loved. His death made the happiest people I know into hollowed out husks, literally crumbling to their knees in sobs just when it seemed they had it together. I'm not sure they will ever have it together again and it breaks my heart. They didn't deserve that. My friend doesn't deserve to feel like it's her fault. His friends don't deserve to feel like they weren't worth sticking around for or reaching out to. I deeply regret hoping for his death at any point, I never realized the full impact it would have on our community. I don't think he did, either.

I hated this guy but he brought a spark to his old man's eye that I haven't seen since and I wonder if he ever knew how much happiness hinged on his existence. I very much wish he hadn't done it.
I had a classmate kill himself. I hadn't seen him in years and I had almost forgotten about him except when I saw him at the shops where he worked. When he died it was like "oh" and this expanse silence filled me. He wasn't even my friend but I had spent my classes seeing his musical talent, his character.. I specifically remembered thinking one day in class that one day he would be the greatest father--not exactly a common thought to have about someone in high school. It felt like something valuable was taken from the world when he took his life. He honestly would never have impacted my life but I knew he would have made a family and his children so happy with his kindness and energy. There aren't many good people in the world that feel like that. No one can replace him...Even people that don't talk to you much see you. They remember you and enjoy that you exist in the world beside them. 
I know I'm way late to this, but I wanted to post in the off chance that you see it.

I was dating this girl about 8 years ago and we spent a lot of our time going on double dates with her best friend and her boyfriend, let's call him Marcus. Marcus and I got a long really well, better than all the other guys and girls in that social circle. He was quiet, thoughtful, and really funny in his own way. I also knew that he struggled with schizophrenia and severe depression but from what I knew was handling it well. Hell, he was very open about it.

Anyway, I got transferred to another state for work and my girlfriend and I broke up and I lost contact with a lot of her friends, which is pretty natural all in all.

About a year ago my ex gf messaged me saying that Marcus hung himself in his apartment that he and his gf shared. I was floored, shocked, and kind of numb to it at first. I mean after all I haven't seen or heard from this guy in years.

Then two days later I went for a walk and this song came on my shuffle, "Winter takes all" by Common Market...a hip hop group that he introduced me to. I just lost it, I mean fall on the ground wailing in tears kind of lost it. All I could think about is how badly he had to hurt, or how tired he had to be from fighting, that he felt this was a preferred option to continue living. I barely knew him and I was in such gut wrenching pain...for him. Then I realized the pain that I felt right then is the same burden that probably carried when he told us all he was doing great.

I don't know where I'm going with this but I just want you to know that, even though you're an Internet stranger, people care. Hell, I care and all I know is that you're in pain. Don't give up, let people know...even if it's a hotline or a message board. The world can be a cruel place but I promise you that there is compassion out there if you seek it.

Good luck and don't give up.
A family member of mine committed suicide in June 2009. I will never forget that day. 

My cousin and I were with my grandparents when my grandmother's sister called and told us. I then had to call my mom and tell her, a conversation I will never, ever forget, I'm crying just typing this. 

She suddenly developed a sickness that stopped her from doing the things she loved the most, topped with a medication that made her depressed (but doctors refused to take her off of), she thought that life was no longer worth living. 
She jumped out of the window at the hospital not long after her parents had visited. They couldn't save her because she was on blood thinning medication, which means they couldn't operate on her. 

We were unable to attend her funeral, but several hundred people flew in from all over the world to attend, she meant that much to so many people. Her mom has stayed strong through it all, but I know it's killing her too. Her dad and siblings as well. 

I've battled depression for a very long time, and I've asked myself this question many, many times. I still don't think a lot of non-family 'friends' would care, but I think more people care than what we think. I've seen my mom lose someone she loved dearly, and I know that if I ever did this, or my brother, it would absolutely break her. I was 16 years old at the time, and I remember sitting in bed crying that day, with my cousin comforting me. She was my cousin's family member too, but my cousin lives in another country, so she didn't have that much of a relationship with her. 

I'm not angry with her, I understand why she did it, and I don't think it's selfish because I don't think anyone makes that decision without a reason. That doesn't mean that I don't miss her, and I do wish she hadn't done it. 
My friend Mavrick. I knew him since I was 8 years old. I'm now 20. He was the sweetest little boy ever. Would do anything for anyone, and was always trying to help people smile. He had a really hard life, and he still did what he could for others. Almost 2 years ago he killed himself. 

I have not gone a day without thinking about him. And we weren't even that close. I saw him about 4 months before it happened at a Halloween party. He seemed so much happier to be away from all the things that gave him a rough childhood. He had such a sweet girl with him, and I've never seen him smile so much. I never was angry at him or blamed him, but man did he cause some grief. His older brother, the strong, confident kid I'd come to know was silent, playing with a baseball that I can only assume they've had since they were kids. I've never seen him so broken. 

To this day it still makes me cry and I still can't believe he's gone. Out of all the people that should be alive today, I feel like he deserves it the most. He'll never get to see that life gets better, and more importantly he'll never get to see all those people who were so heartbroken at his funeral. All his friends that still post on his Facebook wall, desperate to try and have some kind of connection to him again. 

He'll never see how much I care, how much someone he probably never thought would care, does. 

People care OP. And life will get better. You gotta keep pushing through hard times to get to the good times. I guarantee you, your fans would be devastated to see you gone. Even if it seems like they don't care, I promise you they do. All your friends, distant or close, they'll blame themselves for not reaching out, for ignoring your texts and calls, for not noticing that you were so broken on the inside. OP, never ever think that people don't care. Because if you could attend your own funeral, you'd realize how full it actually would be. 
I bet you're thinking about a million questions: Do I matter? Does anyone want me? Am I loved? 

I honestly don't know the answer for you. I've been on the brink countless times, but I know personally that I could never do it. I'm not strong enough. Only you know your strength. Sometimes true strength however is to put down the noose, the gun, the knife, the pills, whatever, and just stop. Ask yourself if you really don't want anything anymore. Death is not pretty, death is not a miracle, death is the ugliest thing that will happen to you in all likelihood.

So, would anyone care? Yes. You would. You are that anyone, because as close as I've ever been, I didn't do it because I didn't have to strength to let myself down and give away the most precious gift I would ever receive. Life is also ugly, but it is also so damn beautiful and I really don't know your life, but I know that life has it's ways of showing it's pretty side every once in a while. 

Do it, or don't, but if you do remember who you're really letting down. You have a gift, use it for every drop of juice it can give you before you decide to get rid of it. And the one thing I do know is if you feel the juice is running out, it isn't. Squeeze from a different angle, from another perspective, and the juice will come flowing. Good luck, OP.
Are you on meds? If so, might not be the right ones. If not, get the fuck on meds right now. It can take a few tries to get the right ones, and you can have a pretty hairy time of it (puking, etc) but I promise you they're better than being depressed by about a million miles. There is no side effect or problem I've yet encountered that's even a fifth as bad as a depressive episode. 

My feeling is that people care a lot - Parents tend to be pretty amazing at pretending bad things didn't happen to their kids. So half the time when it looks like your parents aren't bothered by something, it means they're so bothered by it they can't actually think about it. 

PS: Also, get therapy. Sometimes you can get some kind of perspective on things like that. Almost invariably you can make the day-to-day much easier.

PPS: If neither drugs nor therapy work, try different drugs and different therapy. Takes different drugs for different people, and a lot of therapists are useless.
This clip really made an impact on me, I've shared it a number of times.  It's the best description of the impact of a suicide I know of.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urZxLdrwcbQ
My younger brother killed himself in 2012. Shot himself in the chest in his bedroom with a .357 Magnum. My step mom found him. My brother and step mom had to help move his body and clean his bed. My dad cried uncontrollably all day, and to be honest, he's never been quite the same since. A light has been extinguished, and I don't think it will ever return. I can't explain it, but our family is...different. It goes beyond the absence of a brother whom I loved, whose goofiness made me laugh, who played games with me and watched movies with me and had sleepovers with me, the younger brother who used to ask me to style his hair like mine or who'd join me on a midnight run to a 24/7 taco shop. There's a pain and sorrow that will never leave, I think. It permeates all our family gatherings, in the making of plans, the nostalgic reminiscing, and in the silence. So to answer your question, yes, people would care if you killed yourself. More than you can imagine. 
Thank you so much, I really mean it that made me tear up. Now I really know what it can do to the people around you, I feel selfish just taking an over dose a while back even though I didn't die my family must have been so stressed :( I'll keep trying you've really inspired me 
I do not mean to be an enabler. But I (as someone who has thoughts of suicide but will not do it) feel this argument of living so others are not upset to be a terrible one. If I feel life is just pain, should I just serve time in this endless torture prison jut so my family can pretend that all is OK? I shall bear the pain so they dont have to. Presumably I am weak in some ways since I suffer from these mental issues. Why should I carry this burden for everyone else?

That said, I am not for suicide. I think people that feel this way need help to not feel this way. Instead of being told to just carry the burden.

This may not be what you intended to say. Sorry if I misrepresented you to make my point. 
That's one of the best analogies I've heard and I really commend you for sharing your story. I hope it really reaches OP and anyone else reading it.
Thank you for all of that.

That was actually what kept me from doing the same when I was a teen, in many ways.  I had NO self-esteem, NO self-confidence.  I hated myself.  I was supposed to be *so* smart, yet I couldn't figure out why I wasn't happy, why succeeding at things gave me no feelings of accomplishment, why I was so awful.  And how much it all hurt and I wished it was over.

My Dad would say, "You have your whole life ahead of you."  I asked, "Are you trying to make me suicidal?  I feel awful; I hate myself; and you're telling me I have sixty or more years to feel like this?  Why would I want to feel like this?"

But I realized that the pain killing myself would cause my parents...I couldn't do it.  I liked *them* more than I liked myself.  I cared more about *their* feelings than I did my own.  I wouldn't even crash my car because I liked *my car* more than I liked me and didn't want to see it hurt.

And as your posting, "Breathe.  In and out."  A friend literally wrote that on the palm of my hand one day--he had had experience with depression also; he understood that it's sometimes that simple.  

"Breathe.  In and out."
I'm not OP, and I am definitely not trying to shit on you.

But the pictures you paint don't apply to everyone, and I wish it did. Some people are truly alone.

They don't have a family, even if they have relatives. They have friends who readily toss them aside because you're not happy - not because they are mean or bad people, but because they aren't equipped to deal with it. They have coworkers who are there in the way that everybody that sees themselves as sympathetic or empathetic is there.

You say people are there trying to help you fight that monster, trying to give you the weapons, trying to give you the shields. But some fight it alone. You paint an idealized picture of people's lives, and make it so that it's just the depressed one not seeing it.

Some wake up every stupid fucking day and convince themselves to not just pull into their garage and be done with it. Some go to a psychologist, take meds, and they fight for it but are unrecognized by the ones that could, indeed, have the impact you try to convey. They try to convince themselves what is always said - that it gets better.

People don't truly understand and people don't want to believe that somebody can be truly alone.




As a person with major depression that has been hospitalized involuntarily. I feel like most people don't understand. For me,  I felt completely alone and isolated,  even when I was surrounded by people I believed were friends. When I tried to talk to people,  they treated it as though I was sad,  that it was just a temporary state. But it's not just sadness,  or feeling isolated; it's a crushing weight where you stop caring about anything. My hobbies and the things I did for fun slowly dropped away, because I didn't enjoy them anymore. Going to work,  the gym,  eating,  it was all just habit; I did it because I had to. Going out with friends was,  at best, a temporary respite. 

It's exhausting. I was tired all the time. I wanted to do nothing except sleep,  because while I was sleeping I couldn't feel anything. 

...And it's really fucking disheartening to reach out to people and ask for help,  and either have people not get it "cheer up! "), or just not get any response at all. 

When I lost my job,  and my wife (now ex) told me that she wanted to separate, I didn't even have the force of habit to keep me going. I ended up being involuntarily hospitalized instead of committing suicide. 

I just wanted it to be over. I didn't want to exist. I didn't care about what other people thought or felt,  I just wanted to get off the ride. 

&nbsp;

I've often thought that there's an irony in calling suicide selfish and thoughtless. The argument is that you should live,  because your death will hurt other people. And yet,  that prioritizes your family and acquaintances over your self; their *potential* pain is more important than your current and lived pain. You should endure more pain, so others can avoid it.

To be angry at a suicide victim takes an unbelievable amount of selfishness. That you even consider *her*, and not *you*, that is the selfish one brings me to an absolute rage. Have you ever thought how *they* felt? 
> They all have their own battles and shouldn't have to fight hers

God damnit. This is the exact reason why I have endured crippling sorrow and deppression on my own the last few years. I broke contact with almost all of my friends as an act of selfishness in my mind. They deserve a good friend, and a good friend I can't be right now..  
  
I think I have some reflecting to do..
Well I am sure that my family appreciates not being traumatized but I'll tell you this: When the only thing keeping you alive is the crippling guilt over what your suicide would do to others life isn't too peachy either. And while I really wish that I didn't want to get away from it all it's not all that obvious to me, down there in the dark places, that it's less selfish to demand that someone stays alive so that you don't have to feel bad.

Help costs money. If you don't have it, no one cares about you. 

People always say "You are loved", "People care about you", and "Please get help" without thinking about what that entails. There is nothing more crushing than taking that advice and holding on to that last little bit of hope and then seeing it snuffed out before you when you try to get help and no one seems to give a shit because you're broke. 

Sometimes you have a shitty family. And sometimes your friends abandon or ignore you. And sometimes your significant others will just use you. And for some people, all of these things are true. 

I'm not trying to be an asshole, honestly I'm not. But sometimes life beats people so far into the ground that there's just no clawing out. The earth is too soft and you just keep falling back into the hole. And one day you look up into the sky from the bottom of that hole and realize that nobody's coming to the edge to throw a rope down. 

What do you do then? What do you do when you're out of strength and that hole is now a grave?


From someone who has stood on both sides of this (I personally got very close and was hospitalized for my own protection a very long time ago and also lost my dad to suicide) this is a beautiful and perfect post. 

Thank you for sharing. 


Thank you.
Dam man. 
I'm so glad I beat depression. I'm so glad that in 2010 i decided to not kill myself, and survive just out of spite for he people who hurt me. I'm glad that in 2014 I found the self respect and happiness to want to live just to enjoy life. 

If someone had told me my parents might have responded like this to my death, I might have been more motivated to do it. They ought to feel the consequences of bollocking up parenting as badly as they had. They ought to feel the pain of driving their own daughter to suicide, reading a note that calmly laid out why they were responsible, finding the body they created. 

Alas, I'm going to live as long as I can, and I'm going to try to help my depressed friends find happiness and beat depression as I did a short three years ago. They might not never know how much they damaged me back then, but I guess I'll give the idiomatic best revenge. 

Living happily. 
No, you don't care.

This is all about you. All of this comment is about you, how other people suffer. It's never about Sam.

She was 'depressed'. Everything else was perfect, and it's her fault for being depressed. If a soldier comes back with PTSD, it's the PTSD's fault. The battle was okay.

People like you are why we kill ourselves. You never stop to think, what if something really is wrong?

Blame depression. It's the easy way out.
Not a girl,but my name is Sam.  I'm hopelessly depressed and have been as long as I can remember.  Thank you for the mental image of the mother, with that and the "Don't be Sam.", I cried because I am in the position of being the family burden.  I haven't cried and had such feeling for a while.  Honestly, it's what I needed today.  Thanks.

Thanks for taking the time to write this out.   I've dealt with depression since puberty (I'm 39.)  Although I'm on medications, each year at this time, I get depressed again.  And each year it weirdly just seems to get harder.

This is a really good reminder that I shouldn't even entertain the tiny "better off dead" thoughts that occasionally crop up in my head at this time.
I like your analogy and I want to build on it. She wasn't the only one fighting a monster.

We are part of an army, formed by those who support us (our friends and family). Everyone has their own monster to fight in this war of life, but some are larger than others. And sometimes the equipment we are given is broken. Your friend's equipment was broken, but she didn't see that there was extra equipment around for her to use. And her friends and family didn't see just how chipped and rusted her equipment was because they were too busy fighting their own monsters.

Good post though.
Says you.
Profound 
One co-worker's suicide had such a deep impact on me, that to this day, I'm fairly sure it caused me to blow a pretty important job interview. 

Background: Used to work in a very large law enforcement agency, with a disgustingly high suicide rate among its officers. I was there 5 years, and in that time, 5 officers who I knew personally killed themselves. This doesn't even count a few more who worked in another part of the state, who I hadn't met.

I was applying for another law enforcement job, city police in my home town. I was in the oral board, which consists of a panel-like interview with 3 to 5 individuals who ask questions and determine your suitability for the job. For this particular agency, before you go into the interview, you take 15~ min hand writing an essay, on a topic they give you; my assigned topic was why suicide rates are so high among law enforcement officers. I wrote a few paragraphs on it, adding that I have personally seen the effects of this.

When I went into the interview, they went through the usual formalities, and then asked me a bit about how I had written my essay, asking specifically about my experience. 

I started to lay out the whole story on the most recent coworker who had killed himself (at this point, it had been probably 6~ months earlier). *"Well,"* I said, *"I'd known Officer [name removed] for my entire time with the department. He was always cheery, and pleasant to be around, always asked how I was doing whenever we saw each other. When I came back to work after taking a year off to deploy with the US Army, he tracked me down and insisted on asking how everything was, and how I was doing. His wife was our full-time mental health professional, who would come in and give all the officers a mandatory class every year on suicide prevention...* [I kind of trailed here]*"*

One of the interviewers, a sergeant for the police department: *"So, what happened to him?"*

At this point, I just completely lost all professionalism and couldn't hold back tears any more. Sitting here in the conference room of the police station, I started sobbing enough that I could barely choke out the words *"He shot himself."* I tried to regain my composure and struggle through the rest of the 15~ minute interview in a somewhat professional manner, but there was no going back from there. I did not get the job.

I don't think I realized until that moment how much his suicide had really affected me; I had been holding a lot more emotion pent-up inside over it than I had known. The next week, I called my platoon sergeant from when I deployed with the Army, a man who I have an enormous amount of respect for as a mentor, to talk with him about it. During the early days of Iraq, he lost a shit ton of close friends in combat with 1st ID, and I was hoping he'd have some answers on how to cope with it.

You know what's really interesting, though? This wasn't a "buddy" or a "best friend" of mine. I didn't go to barbecues at his house on the weekends. I didn't call him up to go on hunting trips. I didn't meet him after work for a beer. He wasn't even on my fucking shift. He was just another coworker who I'd run into frequently, and liked making small talk with, because he was just enjoyable to be around. 

And his decision to kill himself still haunts and devastates me. This was almost 3 years ago, and I still think about him every day.

**TLDR:** Yes. People would care.
I really need to read this. When your at the bottom of your hole it get so easy to think that everyone in the worlds better off without you, or you just get so tired of fighting yourself that you just want it to stop. This story made me tear up a bit. After my attempt a couple of weeks back I started getting professional assistance, and it helps. I'm going to keep this in my back pocket in case I get that low again. Thank you for taking the time to share that. 
You're a good person, and I sincerely thank you for posting. 
Thank you.
There aren't enough upvotes in the world.  Truer words have never been written.  Thank you for what you're doing.
as someone who lost a bestfriend the same way a few months ago, and in turn have been thinking why not too... thank you. 
This is the best comment I've ever seen on Reddit in 4 years of Redditing.


It reminded me of this little story from a Boggle The Owl cartoon:

I don’t like the phrase “a cry for help”. I just don’t like how it sounds. When someone says to me, “I’m thinking about suicide, I have a plan: I just need a reason not to do it,” the last thing I see is helplessness.

I think: Your depression has been beating you up for years. It has called you ugly, and stupid, and pathetic, and a failure, for so long that you’ve forgotten that it’s wrong. You don’t see any good in yourself, and you don’t have any hope.

But still, here you are: You’ve come over to me, banged on my door, and said “Hey! Staying alive is REALLY HARD right now! Just give me something to fight with! I don’t care it it’s a stick! Give me a stick and I can stay alive!”

How is that helpless? I think that’s incredible. You’re like a marine: trapped for years behind enemy lines, your gun has been taken away, you’re out of ammo, you’re malnourished, and you’ve probably caught some kind of jungle virus that’s making you hallucinate giant spiders. And you’re still just going, “GIVE ME A STICK. I’M NOT DYING OUT HERE.”

“A cry for help” makes it sound like i’m supposed to take pity on you, but you don’t need my pity. This isn’t pathetic. This is the will to survive. This is how humans lived long enough to become the dominant species.

With NO hope, running on NOTHING, you’re ready to cut through a hundred miles of hostile jungle with nothing but a stick, if that’s what it takes to get to safety.

All I’m doing is handing out sticks.

You’re the one staying alive
It's a lovely sentiment, and I agree with most of what you said.  However, if I wanted to ensure that I was not going to destroy the people I was trying to protect from the damage that I perceived I was doing to their lives, I would not end my life in such a way that they would have to deal with my body.  I would leave a note, so they would not wonder what happened to me, but I certainly would not hang myself in their shed for them to find.  I would end my life in a way that my body would never be found.

I will eschew details, but it does not take all that much imagination.
>If she died, she couldn't lose the fight anymore. She could stop fighting.

Isn't that what everyone wants? To stop fighting? Every fucking day is a fight and you know what...it gets real old real fast, espically when you feel that all your best days are behind you.

>If she'd even caught a glimpse of her mum's face, pale and tear-strained, clawing through the air towards her casket, I don't think she'd have dreamed about doing it.

So she was supposed to have kept being alive because of guilt? Fuck that. Guilt trips is a manipulative and terrible way to get someone to do something.

>They all have their own battles and shouldn't have to fight hers.

Exactly, everyone else is caught up in "the fight" as it were, what right does she or anyone else have to burden other people with their problems?
That's awful :( 
I also have mental illnesses, depression and anxiety. I try not to make a big deal about it you know? I just keep to myself and I've been getter better but sometimes I just lose it like today I didn't want to be around anyone and panicked and went to cry in the bathroom i just don't understand how to get better it's been 4 years now. I think my sister would never forgive me for it and my parents would be devastated to be honest I don't think I could put them through that kind of worry again 
That's awful, I'm so sorry to have a similar mind set when it has impacted you so personally :(

Part of the thing with suicidal ideation is that when you get so everywhelmed with the psychic pain, it's like your critical thinking regions of the brain shut down and you can't find better strategies to cope with the situation. Learning to recognize your early warning signs of stress and taking steps to intervene to stop you from snowballing into a worse state can really makes all the difference, in the long term. It just takes time to learn and establish good coping skills with a mental health provider.
I honestly don't know a whole lot about suicide, but I had a friend who was suicidal 10 years or so ago.  I'll be paraphrasing her advice from memory.

She ended up being given a puppy by a friend after an attempt that scared the shit out of everybody.  That puppy ended up saving her life.  It was the cutest damn pug ......thing, I'd ever seen.  

From what she said.  "You end up thinking you're doing everybody around you a favor by killing yourself.  Your parents won't be disappointed, your friends will stop wasting time trying to make you feel better, etc.  Puppies won't be disappointed in you.  Puppies don't leave you.  They don't care if you failed a test, they don't care if you got yelled at by your boss, they only love.  They're always excited when you come home, they're always devasted when you leave, and that puppy will love you unconditionally their entire life.  But that Puppy will be absolutely devasted if you kill yourself, and there is nothing that anybody will be able to do to fix it.  To that puppy, you are it's entire world, the biggest source of happiness in it's entire existence, and the thought of leaving my puppy behind helped show me how selfish I was being."

So her advice has always been, if you are truly feeling suicidal, get a Puppy.  

So again, I don't know anything about suicide other than please get yourself some help if you are feeling down, and get yourself a puppy.  It'll probably be the most exciting day of both of your lives!
Stay the course, and be encouraged knowing that there are many willing to help you shoulder your burden until you regain your emotional footing.

Fuck, PM me if you want to talk - as someone who has been through this and struggled with it for the last 15 years, I'm by no means an expert, but I have some experience and perspective on depression & suicide, and I'd love to be here for you and talk with you. 

I remember when I was standing on my balcony, aiming to dive headfirst onto the stones 40ft below, and one of the recurring images as I stood out there was of my mother's face when she would hear what I'd done - how it would devastate my family, even though my reasons for taking my own life were because how I felt I'd mistreated and taken advantage of my family, specifically one of my brothers. 

There is a lot of support for you -  here, at home, with counselors, at school, at work - there are a lot of people who are passionate about helping people like us feel better. 

Lastly, rely on the community around you - we are survivors and not just because of ourselves. I remind my closest friends all the time that we live in community with each other. This means when I'm down, I can rely on my community to pick me up, and when I'm up, the community can rely on me. Don't feel bad for being down - we're here to support you. 

Heartfelt love, /u/GemmaNiamh
Gosh. I really didn't expect this to blow up the way it did, but if it's helping folks, then I'm glad it has. It's really warming to know that something positive can come out of tragedy.

u/GemmaNiamh, I never intended to make you feel selfish, and I'm sorry if it's come across that way. My intent was to let you know that there are people who care all around you. Very rarely is anyone given the chance to see the hole they'd leave behind, and to picture it can be hard because it means trying to judge your own worth, one of the first things depression robs you of.

I fear I might have gotten drawn off topic above, but the bottom line is, I think you'd be missed. I think you're loved and that's something we rarely appreciate enough. Heck, you just have to scroll down the thread to see it. I'm glad the anecdote's helped. 
Stay strong, op. I'm rooting for you, and I hope your life gets better, bit by bit. :)
It's not about just living to make your family happy. It's that they want you to live so much - why shouldn't you?

It's not a way to guilt you into the rest of your life. It's a way to show you that you matter to the people around you enough that their grief would be overwhelming. You put enough good into their life that they would trade places with that corpse in a heartbeat, out of love.

Don't live for your family - take your family's would-be grief as a sign that YOU aren't seeing the whole picture. There's something you're missing, an element you aren't taking into account.

As a last resort: There is always one more day. You have one life. You always have the choice, but you can't take suicide back. Even if this life is miserable, it will be over eventually no matter what you want. Why not see what it has to offer? Try to find what you're missing. Get medicine. Get help. Leave the country, if you have to. But don't miss the only opportunity at life that you'll ever have just because of pain. Pain can be tolerated, powered through, cured. Death cannot.
Please don't apologize for opening up a conversation. One of the big things about mental health is that not nearly enough folk discuss it.

I'm actually really glad someone brought this forward. There's a whole host of different reasons to keep going, and other people is only one of them. To clarify what I said, I wanted to reinforce that the people around you would miss you should you pass on, and to add that there are folk more than willing to help, they just need to know that you need it. No-one's telepathic. Reaching out is possibly the hardest and first step towards trying to manage depression and find a way to overcoming it.

A coping strategy isn't a solution. It'll help keep you going until one is found, but it's not a replacement for the likes of CBT.  

But, coping strategies are important. They're your first line of defense. A mindfulness of others works for some. A determination not to give in works for others. Personally, I find my primary reason to keep going is to experience. I believe the philosophical term is a Raison D'Etre, but I could be mistaken there. Anyway, whatever happens, if anything happens, beyond this life, the only thing we're sure of is that we don't take these bodies with us. So, we might as well experience what we can. Smell flowers. Touch things. Go running. Explore. Doing something that makes your heart race and relish it. For me, that utter fascination with something, or that racing heartbeat and the energy it has is really being alive.Some days it's delving into a story. Other days it's running until my lungs are about to give out and feeling the blood thundering around. 

That's a bit of a romanticized ramble, but it's a bit of a look at my more personal philosophy.

And, if I may, I'd like to tack on another point. Depression is, by no means, a sign of weakness. I'd like to throw in the cliche about being too strong for too long, but I find that doesn't always ring true. In my opinion, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and some folks are weak to their own mind playing merry hell with them, sapping their strength and resolve. Just because it's an internal problem doesn't mean you can't get external help. 

I apologize for the long-windedness, and heartily welcome more discussion, if you're up for it. 
Yeah I think it's more along the lines of urging someone to ponder the idea of "maybe I'm wrong and they're right. Maybe my mind IS just playing tricks on me. Maybe I do have worth." It's a start to recovery.

I always thought of it using scientific reasoning: 

What are the chances that I'm right (about having a life not worth living) and everyone else is wrong? The probability is much higher that I'm wrong and they're right. It feels like I'm right, but that's what depression is, it's my mind playing games with me. I started questioning what's real and what isn't. And then some sort of therapy (it's different for everyone but meds and analysis worked for me) helped me start seeing what's real and putting less importance on what's not.
I don't know if any piece of advice could ever apply to everyone... except wear sunscreen
You're completely right. Mindfulness of others is a coping strategy that helps some until they can get the help they need, but it doesn't help everyone. Those who don't have any 'others' to speak of certainly struggle. Good news is that mindfulness isn't the only strategy available, and that there are a wide variety of helplines and resources available for those who don't have family or friends.

But, and I should reinforce this, a coping strategy isn't a solution. They're prompts, things to keep you going until you can seek out treatment and find the right one for you. A Coping Strategy is no replacement for the recommendations of a qualified person, something which I am not.
I wish I was part of the majority who don't understand. I've never read my feelings expressed more accurately as you've just done.
So much this.... I don't want to exist. I sleep because it's the only relief I can get from feeling, which is so enormously exhausting. Currently I am at the lowest i have ever been. I can't do simple tasks. Someone told me yesterday to just "stop being depressed." Oh ok. I'll get right on that. 

My best friend killed himself in June. Right now that is rotting me emotionally. Everything we had together is now just a reminder that he shot himself in the head. Paint that picture. His 8 year old daughter found him and I had to take care of her after it happened. 

You know, I am basically at the point where I am somewhat jealous of him, he doesn't have to deal with life, why should I?! I was already dealing with depression and anxiety before it happened. The world is greatly missing out without him in it alive. It has nothing to do with my anger or selfishness of wanting him back to make me feel better.

He didn't believe he was important enough for this world, or that he could make it through his stressful times and he was so wrong. So so so wrong. I always believed in him no matter what obstacle there was. The world lost a cool ass person who deserved at least a mediocre amount of happiness. Everyone deserves something good in the present moment to hold onto. 
Exactly.  Why should a person have to go through a lifetime of meaningless suffering just because if he decided to end it, someone else might feel bad for a little while?
As I've said above, awareness of others is one of the coping strategies available. It works for some, it doesn't work for others. It wasn't my intention to depict suicide as selfish nor was it cause a guilt-trip.

The intention was to promote mindfulness and increase the awareness that a death has an impact on those around it. 

I'm not expecting anyone to keep going based on that alone. Coping Strategies aren't Solutions. They're supports, things to keep you going until you can find the solution that works for you, with the help of a qualified person. I'm sorry for the misinterpretation.

It is an unpleasant truth that the people that happen to be blood relation are not will or able or just the best to help you out of the things you are going through. There AREA people out there willing and able though. Please look for your local emergency hotline for depression or suicide, most places has one. If not, go to your doctor or even emergency room.

Hope you feel better and find your way. /hug
And if the stress is constant and unavoidable? If the pain is always there every day? How do you cope with something so pervasive?
I sort of have this question too but from a different note. My wife passed away almost 5 months ago. I felt her draw her last breath in my arms and that will never go away. I always hear that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but my wife will never come back. This is a blackness that I will carry forever and has robbed me of all hope and joy. There's a significant chance I'll never find that level of happiness again and an even bigger chance that, if I do, it's at the end of so much pain I might spend more time trying to get there than I have to enjoy it by the time I do. So I ask, why is it fair to ask me to carry this burden, to suffer this pain simply so others don't have to shoulder a smaller burden. Surely it couldn't hurt anyone person more than I'm hurting now? It feels like people just want a happy ending, that they want to see me make some reason out of this so they don't have to see what I see... That life is cruel, pointless and unfair. Most of us don't get a happy ending. My wife didn't, why would everyone assume I would or want to?
Yes. I see what you mean. But fact is that I see my family a few times a year. They dont impact me (in positive ways) in my daily life. I am not present in theirs. They just know that I am out there.

I dont need to me shown that I matter to them. And they matter to me. But it is not enough. I am not sure how common this is or if there are many who wish to die for the specific reason that their family wouldnt care.

I know there are times were it would take literal weeks before I was discovered to be dead (presuming I had vacation from work). This is depressing to me. So while they would care that I die, do they care that I live with pain?

Basically I feel that this is way to complex for the "your family loves you and care about you and would be upset". All this may be true, but in my experience it changes very little about my situation (read: personal experience of it).
This.

Thank you.
Yeah we are different. And I guess for some just knowing that someone cares is enough to cope. I just feel like to often it is the primary tool prescribed by people without and real insight into what people with these thoughts are going through. 

Personally I use the motivation of curiosity and knowledge but it conflicts with my coping mechanism which is escapism, ie I play pc games and work and keep busy so I wont notice my loneliness and depression. But this also stops me from moving forward. 

I am an atheist and as such do not believe in any non-personal "meaning of life" and doubt I will ever find one (that isnt Epicurean), my question and desire is to be happy and can I get that without a sense of purpose and meaning? I dont know. I have coped instead of trying to fix it for many years. Probably making it worse. 

Anyways, that was longwinded and personal without bringing the topic very much further. 
>Depression is, by no means, a sign of weakness.

Oh, but it is. It is a defect in the way our brains process things. *Normal people* dont need to take drugs every day just to not be burdened by the total and complete knowledge that life is meaningless and everything we do will get lost in the noise of humanity.

*Normal people* can talk with other people without feeling like they are a burden on the other person.

*Normal people* can somehow tolerate doing the same fucking thing at the same desk with the same people every fucking day for 30+ years.

*Normal people* dont wish they had the courage to end it all before they finished college so they could go out on a high note instead of getting slowly ground down to nothing over the next 10 years.
I recommend getting professional help. Yes,  talk to friends,  but get professional help first and foremost. I can't promise that things will get better,  or that life will feel worth living. But suicide can wait. You can try to find something that can help,  while holding that option in reserve. 
I think that you pretty well answered OPs question. Your friend probably thought no one cared or would miss him, but *you* certainly do. I think that's a pretty shitty reason to hold on though - I think you should live for yourself, not because other people want you to live.

Grief combined with existing major depression is a pretty bad combination. 

I'm sorry for what you're going through. I don't have any answers for you, certainly no solutions. Remember that you cared for your friend, and maybe there's someone out there that feels the same way about you. At the same time, if you want to live, you need to live for *yourself*, not someone else.

Most importantly, you aren't alone. My life and experiences aren't the same as yours, but I think that I understand and empathize with the way you feel.
They don't. He was just trying to point out that people care, or at least think they do. I'm in the same boat as you guys, if her mother *actually* cared, she would have taken some action to make things better while that was still possible. Rather than waiting until her death to show it.

That said, there *are* good things out there. Don't do it for them if you don't want, do it for yourself, hang on as long as you can and do the best you can to find something worth living for. That way, when your time comes at least you can go with some dignity.
Because it can and will subside. If current therapy and medication trials aren't enough, look at research studies to enroll in for treatment resistant cases. Rely on your support systems and positive coping strategies to mitigate what you can.
Life is not about a happy ending. That mindset will lead you to disappointment and suffering. It's not a fairytale and it's not fair, that much is true.

Life is experience. Life is about seeing and doing all that you can see and do on this Earth before you're gone. Pain is an obstacle everyone experiences - for some it is a fence in their path, and for others it's a mountain.

Why do people climb mountains? It's a whole lot of sweat, tears, blood, time, and pain - why are there mountain climbers willing to do it?

It's to know that you've done it. To stand at the top of the mountain in your own triumph - not to overshadow the pain, but to give the pain meaning and purpose. Love and pain are merely two sides to the same coin - without one, you would not understand the significance of the other.

Give that pain a purpose. Art, music, work, or even speaking publicly about what your wife went through. You're right that the pain will never completely go away - perhaps you can help save others from the same grief.

Ask yourself another question - what would your wife have wanted for you? Would she stand for you to suffer because of her, or ask that you find something to hold on to? Some light in your life, that brings you the smallest joy. Because once you're gone, that joy can never be felt again.

Procrastinate. Tell yourself that there's always another day to make such a permanent choice. You cannot take it back. You have not seen all there is to see or done all there is to do. Throw caution to the wind and participate in something you never thought you could. Skydive, para-glide, pet an elephant, see the Taj Mahal. At the very *least*, do those before you make the choice to lose those opportunities forever.
This isn't a popular opinion or way to say this among those trying to help others, but I will:

The fact is that I cannot give you the catch-all answer. I know what it is, that it is right to live, but it's impossible to put into words. It's something you have to discover for yourself, through experiencing the world and everything it has to offer - the good and the bad in equal measure.

But you're still arguing with yourself. *There is a reason for that*. If there was none at all, you wouldn't be here. You're right that it's complex, and that's all the more drive to keep searching for that seed, that little nugget of hope, and hold onto it tighter than you've held on to anything before.

I'm not a professional, not an expert. I'm just a person who's been to the darkest corners of consciousness and knows that there's an explanation for why I'm still here. And I'm a stranger that, from the bottom of my heart, genuinely hopes you find it. As strongly as if you were sitting right in front of me, searching my eyes for the answers that are too big for me to understand yet.
I am getting professional help, besides that I don't really have friends who I trust enough for me to tell.. All it seems to accomplish is drive a wedge into the relationship. The cost never outweighed the benefits..
Again, stress is there every day and then explodes into a mess other days.

The pain for me is headakes and doctors dont have a fucking clue what to do. I'v been having them every day for almost all my life (at least >10 years). I'm just been given different drugs at different doses with no clue if it would be effective or not.

And support systems...ha. I'm alone and socially isolated, I have no support systems. 
>Life is not about a happy ending. That mindset will lead you to disappointment and suffering. 

Well life in general leads you to that anyways, plus delusionally happy people think that way and seem fine

>Life is experience. Life is about seeing and doing all that you can see and do on this Earth before you're gone. Pain is an obstacle everyone experiences 

I believe the "everyone else jumps off a bridge" scenario plays well here. I mean I *could* crawl to the Pacific Coast and try to swim to Hawaii, that would be a pretty cool experience wouldn't it? And painful too! Well damn I've got nothing to lose!

>Why do people climb mountains? It's a whole lot of sweat, tears, blood, time, and pain - why are there mountain climbers willing to do it?

Two reasons, either they are adrenaline junkies, or they're trying to prove some sort of point/pretend it makes their life mean something

>Love and pain are merely two sides to the same coin - without one, you would not understand the significance of the other.

Sure I guess but it doesn't even out in most cases, so why bother. 

>Ask yourself another question - what would your wife have wanted for you? Would she stand for you to suffer because of her, or ask that you find something to hold on to? Some light in your life, that brings you the smallest joy. Because once you're gone, that joy can never be felt again.

Right, but neither can pain. Plus you won't care anyways. Once you are dead it will be like you never existed.


>You cannot take it back. 

Well neither can birth, but nobody gives two seconds to wonder how much their kid will have to suffer on their life

>You have not seen all there is to see or done all there is to do. Throw caution to the wind and participate in something you never thought you could. Skydive, para-glide, pet an elephant, see the Taj Mahal. At the very *least*, do those before you make the choice to lose those opportunities forever. 

W00t, apparently suicidal people are made of money. If I was, I wouldn't have to work or be around people, which would solve most of my problems in one fell swoop. 

>Life is not about a happy ending. That mindset will lead you to disappointment and suffering. It's not a fairytale and it's not fair, that much is true.

Then I wish people would not have told me it was when I was a kid. Shit, all the media and parents set kids expectations for life way to high. "You can grow up to be anything you want", bullshit. "There is someone out there for you (romantically)", **bullshit**.
Yes. I think you are right. And thank you. 
Do you live in an area with specialists? I hear psilocybin is showing great promise as a treatment for cluster headaches. Have you had a brain imaging diagnostic to rule out underlying structural pathology?
It's hard for parents - they want their children to have imagination, hope, and to become excited at the prospect of a fantastic life. The intentions are the best, it would break their hearts to not see their child be as happy as possible.

But the results are disappointed and jaded adults, when they aren't properly grounded later in life by parents or people around them. That's why it's important to have friends who will give you *good, constructive* criticism as well as support. And that you learn to take it and put it to good use, instead of being hurt or angry.
I'm seeing a neurologist right now. I dont know what other specialists there are.

And ya, had a MRI and it found nothing (same as when I had one in high school). I wish something had showed up, then it would at least be something physical instead of "all in my head".
Well, a start would be to have friends (real, physical, meat-space friends) at all.

>It's hard for parents - they want their children to have imagination, hope, and to become excited at the prospect of a fantastic life. The intentions are the best, it would break their hearts to not see their child be as happy as possible.

This is why I never want children (edit: as if I would ever have the chance). This world is so shitty and full of disappointment, why the fuck would I want someone else to experience it.
Must just be something micro rather than macro that would show up in a scan. It's all physical, either way. Even chemical or cellular is physicial, despite not manifesting a larger structural change.
Ya, it just sucks that it is nothing obvious. I'v been dealing with these  headaches constantly since I was a teenager. Was told there was nothing wrong with me then. Finally decided to get help ~6 months ago and no closer to knowing what is wrong with me now than I was back then.

My life
BTW no it's ObiWan Kenobi 

love it :)
Oh I love it! Not only is the activity good for the depression, but the look on her face would be too. Good on you!
Genius! You find light in the little things, love it.
She asked me one day to make her a dog, I had never done it before I turned to youtube. Now I have made her every animal you can make with a single balloon.  So now she likes to challenge me.  Haha.  It is amazing how I can just zone out and not be ruminating while I am twisting balloons. So therapeutic for me.
She likes to challenge me, and I think it is good for her to see me struggle sometimes because I never give up trying until I make it.  I hope to instill in her that sometimes you have to keep trying to get what you want.
That's exactly the way I see it with my boys. I blog and I make it public. They are teens so they can read about my experiences. I'm also taking some time out as a psychiatric inpatient so I am finding that is helpful. If you'd like to read my blog go to sindahella.blogspot.com.au and see what you think. Good luck xx
My mom has struggled with depression and schizophrenia since she was in her 20's. She's 74 now. Over 50 years of fighting the demons within. But she's never given up and through all of it she is the kind, gentle woman I remember and love from my childhood. 

Did she have bad days, bad months, even bad years? HELL, yes! Literally hell. When the voices in your head are so strong that you ask people around you if "this is real? Am I making sense?" you know it's getting bad. When she tries to talk but she's in so much mental anguish she can barely push out the words and it sounds like someone is pushing on her lungs so hard she can't get a deep breath, it's bad. 

But then she breaks through on a better day and she's calling me to ask me how I'm doing. She's writing letters to family and friends to encourage them. She's pushing herself to be a helper in any way she can even in the confines of her senior's home. 

And she's never lost her faith. Sometimes the 'angels' she talks to aren't real, but there are days I have to wonder if her connection isn't stronger than I might ever know. 

She's amazing because I think most people would have given up years ago. But she won't. Because she's my mom. And she's a hero. 

Don't give up my friends. There are people who are looking up to you even as you struggle on.
Winning is not giving up
Just starting the journey now with a 25 year old daughter and her two year old son. I have her son and she is hospialized. i know this is going to be a long road. OMG......
I thought the voices were gonna go away :-(
There's no such thing as winning. It's just about how fast or slow you lose. 
They do, at times, when she's on the proper medication. But things change, her meds change, her will to stay on them changes, so they come and go. It's mostly under control now, but it's taken years and years of trying every kind of med to find a good combination for her.
Perhaps not the most tactful thing to say on a post like this...
Same

In the US, replace Mad with broke/destitute/homeless and it's the same thing.  I make barely enough to pay my bills as I look for a job (for the last five years).  During which time, my mental and physical health have declined as I can't afford any treatment.  I broke a tooth two years ago and was told that it was going to cost me $6000 to fix as I don't have insurance.

So I've been walking around for the last two years with a false tooth that was only supposed to be used for a couple of months.

And of course, I've been off my meds this whole time.  I've had plenty of offers from people to get me various things, but I'm hesitant to take anti-psychotics from basically a street dealer when I have zero support system in place.  That said, I'm 100% positive that there are plenty of people that do just that.

'murica.  Land of the free and home of the suicidal.
Sounds about right, when I was trying to find a new therapist places refused me because I had been hospitalized in the prior rolling year.
I just got her new book. She's awesome! Worth following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rubyetc). 
I like this. It makes me know I'm not alone. I have been in both of those circles. Luckily I'm in the top one now.

This doesn't make sense- anxiety and depression were adjectives before being disorders
[deleted]
Also crazy and insane can be inappropriate. I've been stopping myself from using those when I won't know my audience.
I hate when people assume (without knowing anything about the disorder) that bipolar and borderline people are super dangerous, unhinged monsters who want to hurt and manipulate others. And gods forbid you actually try to correct them, because they'll start shouting about how they knew a ___ once who was mean and abusive and *obviously* that's how they all are by nature. 

I just want to make it clear that bipolar doesn't mean instantly flipping from emotion to emotion, in fact rapid cycling bipolar disorder is fairly uncommon. It just means that someone can shift from the highest-highs of mania to the deepest pit of depression. 

BPD isn't dangerous, and people who suffer from it aren't dangerous, evil, manipulative people. It often means having previous trauma or neglect which (primarily) can make someone have a deep-seated fear of abandonment, and an insidious thing called emotional impermanence. 

People with these disorders are actually *less likely* to be abusive and/or violent, but of course most people don't care and will continue to think of mentally ill people as future serial killers.
Shouldve been "traumatic memory". Bad memory sounds like dementia.
Your other points are good, except this bit:

> You are not anxious because you're slightly stressed out.

Actually that is correct usage. Anxiousness is synonymous with worry. The mental disorder is named "Anxiety Disorder."

Anxiety isn't the disorder. Anxiety is something normal that everyone gets at times. Anxiety Disorder is when you get Anxious too much and too often and/or too severely.

> You are not depressed because you are sad right now. 

That is also correct usage. Being depressed at times isn't a disorder, it is a normal thing everyone gets. It just means a period of strong sadness. If someone close to someone dies, they would be expected to be depressed for a while. That is normal and expected.

The disorder is "Clinical Depression." The Clinical bit is added to the front to indicate that it is a more severe level of depression than what people should normally experience, and possible without an external cause (such as a death of a loved one).
Let them keep their adjectives, id prefer to go back to being crazy.
I don't disagree with the sentiment, but as someone who's relatively high functioning with a sort of complicated pathology (5 different diagnoses in a few years, none of which have been called a misdiagnosis), things like this make me feel like it's wrong for me to think of anything I'm feeling as a symptom.
Not particularly accurate. I work with these Disorders for a living and I am responsible for diagnosing and treating these disorders on a daily basis.I also live with PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder. 

Anxiety is the same as stress, they are synonymous. There are several disorders which include excessive anxiety. These disorders are called Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, and a few others. Anxiety is something everyone experiences. When it impairs a person's ability to perform their social, occupational, or self care functions, then it becomes a disorder. This is the same for any disorder. 

Stupid is a pejorative term for low intelligence. Retarded is a pejorative term for low intelligence. So, yes, retarded is the same as stupid. The currently accepted term is intellectual disability, which still means low intelligence. The fact that you use two pejorative terms makes it seem as if you aren't particularly concerned with how a person with an intellectual disability would feel if they read this.

I have never seen anyone represent schizophrenia as being contradictory. That doesn't make any sense to me. 

You admonish others for not understanding what they're saying, but you do not show a lot of understanding here
There's actually no correlation between font and reading disabilities; unfortunately, clever marketers have made a lot of money off of products and programs using this idea...
Anxious should be changed to Have Anxiety and Depressed should be changed to Depression. You can be depressed,doesn't mean you have depression...you can be anxious, doesn't mean you have "anxiety" (of course contextually meaning an anxiety disorder) 
It does make sense. I am saying that the MISuse needs to stop. You can't just say things like "I'm so depressed" when you're just in a down mood. It does a disservice to those who are truly depressed. Mental illness has a stigma as is and disorders will never be truly understood if they're thrown around like that. It would be nice for people who don't suffer from mental disorders to have a better understanding what the rest of us are going through, don't you think?
How did medicinal weed help you? I tried it recreationally once and ended up screaming at grass because I thought it was 'watching' me. I was, however, cross hazed so it isn't really a fair example. 
Ohhhh. Yeah came here to ask, since when is forgetfulness considered a common symptom of ptsd??

Thanks for clearing that up 
Thanks for saying something about retarded/stupid. Every time I see an advocate for mental health say "retarded" it makes me want to die because that's really how they see intellecually disabled & neurodevelopmentally disordered people. Like, great! Keep on calling us something that's been used as a weapon against us!
What I am saying with this is that this is how I have heard other people use these terms and that they're saying them without taking anyone else into consideration. I can't tell you the number of times over heard someone say something like "oh my god, I did so bad on my test, I'm so depressed." Or "oh you didn't know that? You're so retarded."
That's not how those words should be used.
Maybe I didn't do the best job of portraying what I'm trying to get across here, but I only had 270 characters to explain it in the title.
I'm not saying that's what I think all of those things mean, I'm saying that's how I have heard others use them and I don't think it's okay to do that.
Maybe other people haven't heard folks say these things. Cool, move on then. I have. I don't appreciate any sort of disorder or disability or medical ailment, or anything that someone can't help, being causally used in conversation in the wrong manner.
I really do not believe that.
And here I thought my lived experience was trustworthy. Thanks for your unsourced "no correlation" though, asshole.
Where are your credible sources on this?
Attention all: take these edits and read the post this way instead 👆🏼

Yes, that is more of what I was going for! I had no clue this would cause such an uproar lol
Thank you - that's much better
I agree with you when people say, "I'm so OCD/bipolar" etc. But you can be anxious or depressed without having an anxiety disorder or depression.
Sorry, maybe I'm going too far saying it makes no sense, I've just never felt the way about people using anxiety or depression to describe their non-illness related feelings (which still match the dictionary definitions of those words) as I do about actually saying bipolar or OCD for completely unrelated things
Pretty sure you are looking for GAD and MDD. People with those disorders don't own the words "anxiety" and "depressed."
[deleted]
It's part of the avoidance symptom. Avoiding to think about a traumatic event can cause someone to forget details about the event (place, date, people).
Depression is something everyone experiences from time to time. It is completely appropriate for someone to say that they feel depressed after a difficult situation, because they are depressed. It doesn't reach the levels of metal disorder, but it is depression and you have no business denying them their feelings. Depression is a symptom of major depressive disorder, but it is not the only symptom. 

You are upset because people aren't using the terms correctly. However, you also don't use the terms correctly. 
Let me clarify- there are some fonts which may be able to improve readability (for everyone, not just those with reading disorders), but it's primarily based on subject preference, not necessarily a statistically significant difference. And fonts designed specifically for those with reading disabilities have no effect. 
Yikes. Sounds like you maybe need therapy for a different reason. 

Try reading the rest of the thread. Another user posted one source. But if you want more, just Google it (or Google scholar, if you prefer). You'll get a ton of hits. It's been decently researched and no clear correlation has been found.

Like I said to another poster- your "lived experience" certainly counts for something- it's just not an evidence base. 
Check out Wery & Dilberto (2016); Rello & Baeza-Yates (2013; 2017-- size only correlated). 

As aforementioned, you can also use Google scholar or just a generic search to research yourself. 
Glad I could help :) 
No and I totally get where you're coming from too.
It's just very frustrating for me, as someone who suffers from both anxiety and depression, to hear people use them that way so often. I think that's where the annoyance is ... that is is SO common for people to use them that way with no regard for those who actually suffer. That's all I'm getting at is that people should think about what they're saying before actually saying it.
I've been getting migraines something fierce recently, and I'm going through everything to try to get it fixed. How did you go about getting it prescribed? 
Forgetfulness is not a symptom of PTSD. The closest symptom is not being able to remember things associated with the traumatic event or events. That is not the same thing as forgetfulness. 
Okay, that makes more sense! Thanks.
I hadn't heard about this, mostly because I had no reason to look into it. Here is [one study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11881-016-0127-1), into one of the fonts. It showed no significant difference. Which makes sense.

edit: also I don't know why you're getting down voted, even if you were wrong (which you're not); it's not like you're being mean about it or something.
Every person with ADHD that I've known (including myself) find it much easier to read fonts with clearly separated characters than fonts where the letters are connected. It makes it more immediately readable.
[removed]
Thank you, they are interesting studies.
[deleted]
Yes, this study references specific fonts designed for people with reading disorders-- which is mainly what I was referencing in my original comment-- definitely no efficacy there but like I said- people are definitely making money off this idea!

And thanks for the note about the downvotes- I was wondering that too. However, I find that many people downvote (in other subs too) when they disagree, which is against the rules. Downvoting is supposed to happen only when the post doesn't meaningfully contribute to the discussion. Oh well. 
ADHD isn't a learning disability; it's a neurodevelopmental disability. My comment pertained to reading disorders. 

Anecdotal evidence is not scientific. What you describe is primarily just preference. Studies show no statistically significant differences with font type or line spacing. 
Seek help for why you feel so defensive about this. 
What is MOM? 

You should x-post to r/art. I like :)
The art is very good. Do you feel the meds have made a difference with your creativity? 
This is lovely! I love your colours, which watercolours are you using?

Also, the darker spots on the paper: are they darker from paint or is the paper warped a bit from over-saturating with water? Because I used to get that all the time, but using a thicker paper while taping it down fixed it. :D
This is the same way I feel about my meds. I feel like there's so many they make up half my diet. But I'd definitely not be alive without them,  so I'm grateful.

Absolutely beautiful work. ♡
Oh I should! Thanks :)
It's a bit complicated but yes. When I am stable on meds I have to really try to create whereas when I'm symptomatic the creativity comes more easily. I don't know if it's meds though. It could just be that when I'm stable I don't have strong emotions and therefore I am less inspired. Complicated. 
I like using Golden brand paints and inks. The darker spots are indeed from warping of the paper. I wasn't planning on making a high quality piece at all; it's simply a page in my sketchbook!
PS - thanks for the tip :) will definitely use for future more purposeful works!
Thanks for the answer.  I like the piece and am trying to improve my own drawing. 
I feel similarly since I started taking meds. Before I started taking them, I found that writing poetry came more easily to me. Usually I would write when a wave of anxiety had just passed over me. For some reason, my mind felt looser, if that makes sense.

Also, I wanted to say that your artwork is lovely :)
This is *exactly* how I feel. I'm more consistent in practicing art when I'm on my meds, but I'm more "inspired" when I'm off them. (But it's like, bursts of intense art but then nothing for months.)
Haha, that happens to me a lot! (I end up with a lot of sketches I like on lined paper from work...!)
Anytime! I love watercolour, it was one of my favourite mediums in school. If you need any help, holla!
I know exactly what you mean! Frustrating because I love making art but hate how it's like pulling teeth nowadays. Comes and goes. 

Thanks for the compliment :) happy that my art is being well received. 
Brains are so wonderfully complicated. 
Awesome, thanks!!

Couple of my favorite quotes from her Wishful Drinking book:

>“One of the things that baffles me (and there are quite a few) is how there can be so much lingering stigma with regards to mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder. In my opinion, living with manic depression takes a tremendous amount of balls. Not unlike a tour of Afghanistan (though the bombs and bullets, in this case, come from the inside). At times, being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you're living with this illness and functioning at all, it's something to be proud of, not ashamed of.

>“I thought I would inaugurate a Bipolar Pride Day. You know, with floats and parades and stuff! On the floats we would get the depressives, and they wouldn’t even have to leave their beds - we’d just roll their beds out of their houses, and they could continue staring off miserably into space. And then for the manics, we’d have the manic marching band, with manics laughing and talking and shopping and fucking and making bad judgment calls.” 
I didn't think it was possible to love her more -- then this happened. 

 
She drowned in the moonlight, chocked on her own bra.
TY Fisher.  It breaks my heart that it was your passing that has likely saved my life, probably twice over really, but I'll always remember.  Ty with love.
Love this
her medication is literally keeping her together now.  
Yeah this made me smile this morning. What a lass!

Alt version:

Disclose and don't get the job in the first place because of social stigma about mental illness.

Keep quiet and lose said job within months of starting for not being able to meet the requirements due to side-effects and symptoms of whatever condition one is living with coupled with the stress of full-time employment.


My gf left it off of one application for a retail store, and disclosed it on another for a different store. Got the one she disclosed it on
I don't think I've ever seen that on a job application, and I don't think it would be legal, either. But if it did come up, of course you don't disclose. There's no way it could possibly benefit you, and may very likely keep you from getting the job in the first place.
Disclose and they likely won't give you the job. They'll see you as unreliable and a liability. Nope.
According to US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:
•They cannot ask you if you have a disability that will affect your performance on the job on an application. 
•Have you been treated for mental illness?

However they can ask after making a job offer. 
https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/jobapplicant.html
No, no, no, no, no disclosing this shite. 
I always disclose. I've never regretted it. 
We need to be brave and change perceptions 
In the US it might be legal for some professions (e.g., police officer). I do know most every job application I've filled out asks if you have a disability (usually supposedly confidential), but I'm not sure if that includes mental illness or not.

Most likely OP is outside the US though.
I've job hunted in the US and UK and everywhere asks about disability as an equal opportunities thing. And since mental illness is considered a disability, that's how they cushion the question.
In the UK, we have questions like this and also questions about gender, sexuality, ethnicity, etc. at the end of the form on a separate page. It is not part of the application and they just use it for monitoring. The questions are optional. 
IT Professional here, it's on every application that I've submitted in the last couple of years, mostly in major cities.  Big part of the reason that I've given up on getting a job and focusing on working as a consultant.  Fortunately, I just started with a firm that I work from home with, so I make my own schedule, so if I have to take a break, I take a break and come back.  The downside is that I don't get paid for any of that time and I don't get benefits, but at least I'm not about to lose my home.

Edit: Which has happened ... a few times.
Congratulations on your firm! That's really cool. I admire people with business talent.
Business skills aren't a big deal.  Sales skills are.  I'm terrible at sales, but I can see an opportunity, and if I have a good relationship with someone, they'll usually listen.  It's establishing that initial relationship that I have problems with.  Usually when I'm meeting someone for the first time, it's because they've got something that isn't working, they tried to fix it themselves and made a huge mess, they lie to me about it out of embarrassment or to shift blame, and then want a flat rate.  Then, if I give them a flat rate, which I almost never do, they start making requests, or something will come out of left field that will change the whole thing.  Then we'll have a conflict because I'll explain that they have to pay more, and then it just goes downhill from there.

You have to admire a sales guy's ability to sell something that they have no understanding of.

For instance, I saw a request this morning for a server upgrade.  Sales guy's response: no problem, we can do that.  
My response: I need the history, status of the current server, do they have a new server already in place, what's the os of the old server vs the new server, what services is it running, and I'm going to have more questions after this is done.  
The response that I'm expecting from the customer: how much will this cost?  
My response will invariably be: fucked if I know, you haven't answered any of my questions.

I can do ROI analysis, research for days or months on end, come up with multiple solutions, forsee market trends with pretty reasonable accuracy for someone that isn't a soothsayer, implementations, translate IT person to executive, but ask me to cold call, and I'm completely flummoxed.

This is such a great shot. 
Looks great
I suffer from quite severe anxiety at times too and I find photography to be VERY therapeutic. Good shot! 
Nice use of bokeh.
Lovely picture. Photography helps me too
I just realised photography helps me too. How could I have never realised before? 
That's better than how I combat mine.
Everyone here talking about how it helps. 

What do you shoot with ? 
Nice picture.  Love the flowing nature/formal structure contrast 
Nikon d3300.
What lenses ? 

Spot on.
This is great art. 
Every waking moment.
yeah
I like this a lot besides having the medication in the side that's weighing you down. 
...nah
i like that they list it on both sides - when medication works, it works. but when it doesn't - it really doesn't.
You replied with your opinion. Does not make sense that you get downvoted since your post is relevant.

This is amazing. I've never seen something so truthful, yet so macabre. 
This is fucking dark.
I wish I didn't relate to this so much. 
see the trick is, is to wear the suit to bed

that is really intense. i hope it's not too bad there and that the people who should be helpful are being helpful. and that you've got good ones to talk to. 

love and luck, stranger. 
[deleted]
This is just fucking cruel dude!
I'm working through the process of trying to find a new mood stabilizer.  It is awful.  I keep mentioning to people that the 2 people in my family that could help me the most committed suicide decades ago.  Their loss has always haunted my family and this is a good reminder that the struggle is worth it for the people that love you.  Good luck.  It can seem like no one understands but there are millions of us in this fight.
Did you voluntarily commit yourself for treatment; how long have you suffered with depression/bipolar?
 The message is so raw and real that I can see why it struck such a nerve with you.  Please discuss more as I am glad you are willing to share this. 

Having lost someone to suicide, I can tell you the result is a tremendous and ongoing painful process. 
I don't even know where to begin in describing what's so wrong with this post.

It's not helpful, for starters. It promotes a falsehood that suicide is selfish. And it's an inane comic that isn't even meant to be taken seriously.

Many people who try to take their lives do so because they think they're doing other people a favor. For them, a post like this reinforces the idea that they're bad people -- and reinforces the idea that they perhaps SHOULD take their own life.

Which, really, is the exact opposite of what I think most people here would want. 
I went through a time of suicidal ideation, mostly because when I asked myself if I mattered to those around me I couldn't feel as if I did. My choice was to bury it for the time being, but when it came back up, I realized I didn't love myself back then because I had no one in my life that could show me how.  My parents didn't love them selves and I just naturally absorbed that energy, because that's the only mechanism kids brains have for understanding their environments.  
There is better, and you will experience more in your life even if it doesn't feel like it now.  Ultimately, the best solution is to start to experience that self love without the guilt piece, and just know there are others who found it coming from their own pretty dark places too.  Love and thoughts internet friend.
Way to close to home with this one. Ugh the feels.
I disagree: people commit suicide (in my part of the world) to stop their own pain.  But the point at the end is still correct.
That comic hit me.  I'm a survivor of suicide by cop, so seeing my parents while I was locked up was really hard.  Their faces were heavy and lain with grief every time I saw them, and it tore me up inside to see how it affected them.
You're allowed to use your phone? They didn't let us have our phones when I was in a psych ward. You're one lucky man. Use it to your advantage and also use the doctors and help to your advantage. I get better every day but sometimes I still think about just ending all of the pain. Be stronger than me. Don't let it phase you. 
Well that's something to paste in my wellness journal... It makes me think of Robin Williams and what I saw afterwards. Its hard if not impossible for those who are suicidal to think about what happens afterwards for others. 

I'm in a decent enough place to realize that if I had killed myself on the day I was alone in my apartment, the lives of my friends and family would be destroyed. But in the moment? All I was thinking about was that I was taking someone else's place in life. I honestly don't know how to feel about this comic. I don't know if I should be upset that they're painting the dad as selfish or sad that the son is now going through the pain afterwards. I agree with you OP, the comic hits you hard.

I hope you are getting the help you need OP!! *internet hugs* 
Yep, just pile that fucking guilt *really* fucking high, OP.  Some of us need to feel even shittier than we already did when we came here.
Thanks for linking to that Maria Bamford podcast episode, haven't heard that one yet. I've listened to a few episodes of The Mental Illness Happy Hour; highly recommend it. 
Well it helped me realize how selfish it would be of me to kill myself and how hurt my family would be. 
I'm completely voluntary, and I've been struggling with it since I was ten years old, I'm twenty now. I'm just tired and want the pain to end. But I know I'll just hurt the people around me. 
Well, it helped me. I'm sorry it hurt you. 
Well I'm sorry I hurt you, but it really helped me and seemed to help some other people in this thread. 
This is absolutely the wrong attitude towards the suicidal that we should have. Calling people who commit suicide "selfish" is beyond unempathetic and judgmental. There's a reason guilt-tripping and "suicide is selfish" comments are strictly forbidden in suicidewatch; it's hurtful more often than not.

It's sad that this attitude is being propagated in a sub designed to educate people about mental health. Shameful.
I completely agree with ^
I am so sorry that you have such a mentally  painful illness; however, you have insight into your illness which is very promising.  The fact that you voluntarily sought help, concerned about the pain of those close to you, and your apparent intelligence is something you should focus on. Most people don't really understand how painful  it is for those with suicidal ideations/thoughts. If you have dealt with this for so long (from 10yrs old), that must be incredibly hard and mentally crushing.  I am truly sorry for this. I am sure you are taking medications; however, I also understand it's difficult to find the best Med or combination.  I just say all of this though to encourage you to focus on others as you have. A dear friend failed to, and his death was beyond devastatingly painful for his family and friends. We all feel we let him down somehow; and the void of his absence was and is crushing. 

What helps you the most or helps you feel lighter?  There is much new research into treatments.  Your post touched my heart  so. 

I also feel the Reddit community is a good as you can discuss things and most everyone is supportive. 
I didn't say it hurt me.

I'm saying it will, however, not help others - and quite likely do some damage.


And, as at least one other person here who had a lot more patience than I do has pointed out, your bullshit guilt-tripping stick-figure cartoon **actively harms people**.  But don't just take my word for it, [read this list of talking tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/).  Pay particular attention to this bit:

> **Perception that one is a burden.**
> We can prevent this from getting worse by avoiding solutions, advice, and judgements. We can sometimes improve it by reflecting back to the person things that we genuinely value or appreciate about them, but it has to be utterly sincere. If you can't find something specific, positive, and accurate to say, just move on to the next strategy. By building a strong rapport you may discover some genuine positives that you can reflect back to the person.

Piling on the guilt by calling suicidal people selfish and saying they hurt other people **is only going to make someone feel like more of a burden**, as multiple people here, even the ones you think you've "helped," have pointed out.
Of course you'd be downvoted for speaking against the disgusting attitude towards the suicidal, despite providing actual evidence to support yourself.

Guilt-tripping is an extremely ineffective and potentially harmful method. Just because it "helped" some people like OP doesn't change the fact that it hurts far more people. Living solely off guilt is unsustainable, and calling suicide "selfish" is so fucking ignorant and callous. 

I like the analogy.  Thanks for sharing it, OP.  I just wish there were something as reliable and repeatable as glasses for depression.  Right now it feels like half of the "lenses" out there just planks of wood with rusty nails pointing inward.
Just what I needed to see tonight. 

Every nonth is mental awareness month 
What happens in this month to raise awareness?
I just got a campus wide email that a student committed suicide. Seeing this... there needs to be way more awareness and support than there is. 
A month is a start.  It will take a lot more than that to raise the awareness needed though that is forsure
I just started this blog - [The Mental Health Repository: Winding Through The Willows](http://throughthewillows.com) - that focuses on mental health literacy, hoping to raise MH awareness in Singapore.

There is a serious lack of easily accessible resources here. 

Edit: Typo
May the Mental Health Be With You.
CMHA is doing a thing: http://getloud.mentalhealthweek.ca

Man, that's what everyone keeps telling me. It doesn't seem like it to me though, got to the point where I tried to hang myself last week and today. But everyone keeps telling me this and sending me this pick lol everyone loves bojack. I never seen it but it must be pretty good
actually Rick and Morty had the most optimistic pessimism bit that really spoke to me.

"Nobody exists on purpose. Everyone's gonna die. Come watch tv?"

It made me realize that it is OKAY to just like knitting and books and tv shows and lose myself in them. It doesn't make me a bad person that I'm not out there protesting with every spare moment and donating every spare penny to charities. It doesn't mean I have to find some massive, overarching plot to entertain people with. I don't have to make other people happy. I don't have to  spend my life in the service of others. I can just enjoy being myself. And it doesn't make me a bad person to do nothing spectacular with my life and just you know, live.

Mr. Peanutbutter said it in an episode of Bojack, but in a different way.

"None of this matters, you just keep filling our lives with meaningless things, and eventually, you'll be dead."

Yet he is literally the happiest character in the show, and like Bojack, I hate him, because I am Bojack.
I'm so glad you're feeling better :) 

Today is much better than yesterday!
Made my life a hell of a lot better!

Took a lot of treatment before to get my mind to a state where it could accept this but so true.

I found it more useful/accessible than 'take it a day at a time' but essentially it's the same message. 

I used to have a perfectionist mindset and would lie awake all night planning going jogging, applying for jobs, basically doing everything and I'd do none of it and feel like a failure.

Then I thought, if I just get up and do one thing, like jogging on its on, I could actually do it every day and I'd feel good and it really built up my once shattered confidence.

Everyday is a struggle still now but in a good way.

The Bojack series truly inspires me and has helped me, I just totally relate, so many great quotes from this show both optimistic and pessimistic, and of primary and secondary experience of mental health issues.

Stay strong, find inspiration and comfort where you can.
True dat
I really just don't think this is true 
I don't know you, but your comment broke my heart. Please keep at it and keep trying to live. You are not alone.
Please watch the show! I've been where you are and if nothing else, it'll make you laugh and I think it will be a distraction and a comfort. Please feel free to PM if you just want to talk.

Thanks my dude, I really needed to hear that right now

>It made me realize that it is OKAY to just like knitting and books and tv shows and lose myself in them. [...] I don't have to spend my life in the service of others.

Yeah I enjoy knitting and tv and games but at the end of the day I barely have any time to myself to do them.

That's because I *do* have to spend my life in the service of others. If I don't, I get to be homeless, and do none of the things I enjoy.

Although I guess that's probably not what you meant on second thought
And that's fine everyone has different opinions. It just helped me so I thought maybe it would help others. Because in my opinion, you do have to work every day to try to get better, and sometimes it does pay off. But I do see where you're coming from, I'm not trying to offend anyone.
What a wonderful message to wake up too!! Thank you! I'm trying
Thank you. I'll give it a watch
Why?
Yeah I was talking about volunteer work and saving the world and all that.
You are so much stronger than you know. Just trying takes so much. Keep fighting. You will get all the happiness you deserve, and sooner than later! <3

Oh I'm sorry, in the past I tried to off myself and someone tried to find me just by my general area. Tried to send cops. 

USA btw, and thank you for the kindness :)
[deleted]
Man are you my twin? I hate that instead of letting me leave in peace people flip the fuck out and make me suffer for years. I've been suffering for 24 years, why must it continue just so they can be happy?


And they say suicide is selfish...psh
I never thought I would have come this far- I was seriously considering ending my life in February and I am so glad I'm still here. I have a pretty bad eating disorder as well that I am currently struggling with, but it feels nice to not have both self harm and an ED weighing me down. I wouldn't say I'm "recovered" but I certainly am in a way better place than I was.
Well done! Any tips or insights you can share? ED and self harm seem to be one and the same for some people. What keeps you from falling back on bad habits?
Congratulations that's amazing!!
I'm working on reaching your goal too ^,^  
go you! now kick that eating disorder's ass!
Congratulations, that is a huge achievement! You should be really proud of how far you have come and the strength that you have shown in being able to stop.

I know its not an easy thing to do, I am right behind you. I stopped self harming in March and so far, so good :)

This is a HUGE thing! Congratulations! 💜
Good job! 
Well done OP. It's tough. I'm at 4 years, I hope you can make it too but if you don't, that's okay! 
Congratz bud keep it up!
Power to you my brother. 
Congrats! That is truly an amazing feat!
kudos! So happy for you. ♡
Kudos!
You should be very proud of yourself!!!!  Congrats!!!  
Congratulations my dear! I used to self harm in my tens and early 20's, it was a (harmful) coping method I used to deal with self loathing, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I haven't self harmed for ten years.

It was difficult to stop but I think what helped me was I came to a point where I realized I did not want any more signs of my inner turmoil on my physical body, that I just wanted to heal on all levels.

Once again, congrats and good wishes.

I would say definitely have people who keep you accountable- one of my friends is constantly asking me if I'm doing okay which seems annoying at times but it is great to know that if I need to talk about something or if I'm struggling that they're there.

It's so hard going on. Day to day. The struggle of bipolar. And DID plague me. But somehow I manage. 
Then add drug addiction into the mix because it's the one thing that makes you feel normal. Then fight yourself over how you need to get clean.

>Just stop being sad!

>Meet new people and find new hobbies!

>What about all those kids in like Africa!?!?!?! Be grateful! 

>The world is your oyster

Yeah. Fuck off.
A very sad truth indeed. :\
I hate this! Someone has cancer, everyone sends them flowers and wears tshirts and shares pictures on Facebook. Someone has schizophrenia, they are labeled as "crazy" and everyone says things about them. It is just terrible.
I had to fill out some paperwork for something recently and it asked about what health issues you have.  For some reason I was okay checking anxiety disorder but I checked negative on depression.  They're both miserable, but one feels like it'd come back to bite me worse. =\
Here's a positive story:

I have depression, a severe phobia, and last month had a two-week work trip to the US that ended up triggering a bunch of panic attacks. I only made it to the end of that trip with the help of the nurse practitioner at the site, who was awesome about mental health issues.

I talked to my boss once I got back, told him that I was having new, serious problems, and that I was not going to be on top form at work for a while. We discussed what we could do at work to help me (if I needed to work from home more often, things like that), decided not to discuss future work trips for now but I wouldn't get sent anywhere until I told him I was ready and we would do what we had to do to make sure I was okay, and he reassured me that I didn't have to worry about my performance right now. Guess who's baseline anxiety has dropped significantly since that chat ...

It can be difficult for employers to understand and respond to mental health needs, because they're just not educated about them. Whilst it takes energy and courage, if we can confidently tell our bosses that we have a problem, and *what we need them to do*, any decent manager will be on our side and help us however they can.
Have people really been fired for that? Sounds illegal. 

If I read it right, it appears to be a 14% difference, not much, but better than going the other way.
[deleted]
Teens getting married now eh.
14% is huge. If 1 in 6 dead people rose from the dead, it would be an enormous amount of miraculous recoveries, right? Well that's what's going on. 1 in 6 who otherwise would have died, didn't.
Yup. LGBTQ teens feeling as though they are more accepted by society and having hopes for their future is showing their need to "grow up and stop bitching".

They're fucking kids, so telling them to grow up is kinda ... stupid. Teenagers are just kids at the end of the day. They should be allowed to be normal teenagers. 

Wanting equal rights and to be treated like a normal human being instead of a being told they're wrong and different and other isn't bitching.

It's a legal contract that comes with a whole slew of social benefits and legal benefits that they previously were excluded from entering.

Just because you're salty about your own relationships  doesn't mean there isn't value in marriage equality. And your saltiness has exactly nothing to do with the very real problem of LGBTQ teens killing themselves.
Over 50% of marriages end in divorce in 5 years or less? Please give us your data source. 
But.... But it's an easy step to get better tax treatment
And/Or teens thinking about their future prospects of marriage, and the social stigma that comes with the policies.

It's great how art can affect people, be it a song, a film, or whatever. "Kids movies" are chocked full of things like "believe in yourself" and "stand up for what you believe in," little words of wisdom, but most people cynically shake their heads or completely disregard it all together. Don't be ashamed of where inspiration comes from and carrying around a plush. Keep whatever gives you strength with you and let go of the things that drag you down, whether it's family or people you're "friends" with. It took me more time than it should have to figure out that keeping negative people around just brings you more negativity and negates your happiness or your desire to move on to something better. Hope things look up for you.
You go girl ! :)
You are doing great! Loved your reply to that prickly dude.
It's pretty amazing how just one film can have a profound effect on a person. Lesson to learn, never underestimate the power of art, in it's various forms. Congrats on your improvement/recovery anyway.
 Keep kicking ass. :) <3
This is not embarrassing at all! This is really beautiful in so many ways. I'm really happy for you and happy that you could find art/expression that really touched you and spoke to you. Keep doing what you're doing!
It was a good movie, nothing to be embarrassed about! It really inspired me too :) 
Movies, television shows, video games, books and other media can have profound and transformative effects on our lives.

But make no mistake: YOU prevented your suicide; through your willingness to continue to persevere, fight and thrive. Entertainment has the power to move us, grow us and change us, but it doesn't give you access to some wisdom or truth that you lacked before. It just uses storytelling and artistry to give you a new perspective on strength you already had with you. Give a movie credit, but give yourself more of it. 

Keep what gives you strength close to you, and congratulations on winning the fight today. Keep kicking ass. :)


T_T

I really need to see this movie, now...
[I have something for you, OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6rP-YP4c5I)
Sorry, everyone! Didn't mean to spam. I was trying to change the image that went with it and didn't know if it would change if I just changed the album cover on Imgur. My apologies! 
I had a really snarky friend (ugh, and his awful girlfriend) and they were talking about how bad this film is from the trailer, and how they refused to see the film. I'm glad you saw it, and that it changed your perspective.

I know it probably won't affect me in the same way it has affected you, but the fact that something as simple as an animated movie has given you a reason to keep on going is genuinely inspiring.

Keep up the fight.
For me, it was inside out that helped me get over my depression. I'm glad zootopia helped you. 
No matter the reason, it's great to see that it helped you
[removed]
Arguably, zootopia wasn't only full of bite sized chunks of wisdom, a lot of the movie was very realistic about how life works and all the characters are flawed. 
Aww! Thanks! It's okay though! I totally understand where they were coming from with the first post. I like spam as much as the last person, haha. With the second, eh! Everyone is entitled to their opinion :) 
Thank you so very much <3 
You really do 
Oh gosh! Sorry! I was trying to change the image that went with it and didn't know if it would change if I just changed the album cover on Imgur. My apologies! Didn't mean to spam! 
Very true. Maybe that's why it was so good, because the characters were more relatable due to their flaws. Everyone has a multitude of flaws and many old school Hollywood films either neglected to put those in or tried to draw attention away from them and focus on a more perfect person, which doesn't exist. I'm glad they've started getting away from this horrible fundamental mistake. In Zootopia, it was pretty obvious how each character was flawed and how it defined them as a person. 
[removed]
Also, the attention to detail was nice. Made it seem more authentic 
Okay :). Have a great day! 
Don't listen to him, hun. He's just being 'prickly'. 

Loved your post! :) 
Aww! Thank you! 

And it's okay :). Everyone is entitled to their own opinion! 

So did you get the Mountain Dew??
That's lovely, you're very lucky to have such a caring sister :) Always good to have something to keep positive and motivate you.
wow that is super nice
This really made my day.  I am glad you're doing better 
This is wonderful. And keep up with your classes for free Mountain Dew! :)
At what age you two were?
Beautiful. 
Lucky to have a caring sister. Many of us aren't that lucky. 
Neither of us remembers for sure, but she's pretty sure I did! :)
She is awesome. We may be far apart now, but I know I always have someone to count on.
It made my day, and does so every time I find it again.
Going through a difficult breakup right now, so I'm really glad I found something so positive.
I'm glad it made your day! And thank you. I definitely still have struggles, but sometimes I have to trust the people around me that I'm going to make it - even when I don't think I can.
I'd be totally on board with turning that into a lifetime offer!
Nice you saved all those little notes that mean so much:)

Great documentary on the subject, The Bridge (2006):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u10VsLsWPc4

The hardest hitting part for me is that the few people that survived the fall regretted jumping. They said they had all these problems, all these mistakes, and while falling they realized they were all fixable except the one they'd just made.
Thank you for sharing. It absolutely breaks my heart because that means the people who passed away, most likely regretted it as well. Their last moments were scary, lonely, and full of regret. My eyes are starting to tear up just thinking about it. 💔 May their souls and their minds Rest In Peace.

Idk if this is mentioned in the documentary or not, but there is an amazing volunteer group called the "Bridge Angels." The group members take turns standing watch at the bridge looking for people who are alone and quiet who may be contemplating jumping. All they do is just engage in simple conversation with people who appear sad and lonely. It doesn't take a lot to help someone. You don't have to know any magical or healing words. All it takes is a simple "hello, how are you today?" to potentially save a life. 

Thank you for the link! I will have to grab a box of tissues and check it out. 
Very true. A lot of people haven't heard a genuine "how are you today" in a very long time. That hits the homeless too, they're seen as scenery or problems instead of people.

Love to become a Bridge Angel myself, if I was on the other coast.
That picture was taken when I was visiting friends. I now live in the South on the mainland for school, but I used to live in Honolulu, HI where the homeless were by the hundreds. Whenever I see a homeless person, I'm always sure to smile at them. If I have a snack in my purse or a bottle of soda (which is always), I give them the rest of it. If I'm getting a new comforter, pillow, or throwing out clothes, I always laid them out near homeless people. I know it's not much, but it's something. Human lives all hold the same value. 💛
I've lived there. Well close, Vacaville, but we went to SF on the weekends as a teenager. Been across that bridge many times. To me, the thing most people don't understand how far hopelessness can go. WWI fighters were in the trenches with gas and artillery. They (18 +/-) knew hopelessness because they saw death daily. It's more hidden today, but just as powerful. Not as many deaths, but the ones that happen take longer...

Id say they're both true, but what do i know, I'm just a patient...
That's what is sinister about depression. It clouds your reasoning, so that possibility isn't even seen as an option.
Philip Defranco said this before, he also said "Suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems" i think they are both commonish phrases, but he helped them get out there more
Well expressed and worth repeating. Keep on keeping on.!
[Suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aebsLSu3Igk) Robin Williams had so many amazing quotes

I know how to spell "eliminate"
Haha

This is disgusting, all my psych med and counselling appointments are covered here in Canada. Ugh, this is so terrible. I'm so sorry people have to suffer without help.
Please read this article: [Almost half of private psychiatrists don’t accept insurance. People die as a result](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/16/11234516/mental-health-industry)

It's highly relevant to your post, masterofwolves, and not enough people are paying attention to this problem. Mental healthcare in this country is a cruel joke.

"...almost half of private psychiatrists don't accept insurance and more states are cutting funding for mental health services, so receiving the right care can be both challenging and expensive.

It seems strange that such a large number of mental health professionals don't accept insurance. According to a 2014 study in the Journal of American Medical Association Psychiatry, low insurance reimbursement rates for psychiatrists are likely a major reason for this.

Psychiatrists are often only reimbursed for medication-management visits, which are typically allotted 10 to 15 minutes of coverage by insurance companies, leading some psychiatrists to feel unfulfilled and uncomfortable with the quality of the care they are able to provide to severely mentally ill patients."
Fuck the USA, seriously. The founders of this country are rolling in their graves at the state of our health system. You're one accident away from financial disaster!
According to Obama there is no reason someone should be uninsured.  I work at a community mental health clinic in the US.  If you don't have insurance you can apply for it at the Welfare office.  If you are eligible you will get medical assistance.  Then you can see us for free, no copays. 
I pay $25 for every behavioral health appointment including pdoc and therapy. Maybe $40 a month on medicine. I've been on disability though so I probably won't qualify for my insurance to continue. Those prices look nightmarish. 
I feel for you dude. I'm in the same damn boat. I'm on three different meds. One is really expensive, but absolutely worth it to me because it's worked wonders for keeping my depression in check (when I was on Paxil before this one it just fucked me up...Wellbutrin made my anxiety skyrocket). I had to go through insane hoops to get them to cover it. Since it's the beginning of the year though I have to pay out of pocket for it till I meet my deductible. Actually about to go pick it up right now and I'm kinda nervous. 
You may be able to get a reduced copay. At one point my insurance doubled the copay for outpatient. My therapist told me I could write a letter to my insurance company saying I could not economically afford the new copay and what amount I could afford. One copy went to them and the other went to my therapist.
it worked. 
"Doc, I'm just so fed up being forced to live as a slave in a society that values money above all else, even genuine human empathy or connec--"  

"Sorry, our time is up. That'll be $80." 
I once heard a figure used to discourage people from taking up a psych degree.

Apparently 96,000 psych degrees are awarded every year in Canada. Apparently there are 98,000 clinical psychologist positions in Canada. I'm not completely sure of these figures, but if they're at least somewhat representative then my followup question would be..

Are certification standards so ridiculously high that only 3% or so psych degree grads qualify for them?

If so, ok, I hope 97% of students are warned before they start their degree what it'll do for their employability. It's a great body of knowledge for the general public to be learned in, but damn I can't see it being worth $50,000
This is horrifying. We should be mortified as a people. 


This is super cheap compared to the prices I've seen. I work for a behavioral health billing company in MN/WI.
Interesting that most of the comments are regarding the cost.  My first reaction was being abraded by the fact that your treatment options read like a menu.  "ooh,,I'll have the follow up with a short order of depakote"
Pretty cheap really.. lol
Im in Australia. We don't do a lot of things right here, but mental health is one of the few things we do do right. I'm so thankful that I don't have to pay for my health stuff. 
Same here in Canada. Now if the waiting list for services could be less than 2 years...
Psychotherapy isn't covered in Canada, just psychiatric services. Good luck getting a psychiatrist. Some extended health insurance has limited coverage for psychotherapy. Also no universal drug coverage. So Canada still has a long way to go. 
My therapy appointments are covered by my insurance here in the US as well; those rates are for uninsured/self pay. 

There could still be deductibles that would require you to pay full price until a certain point with some plans. 

I'm not trying to say it's ok that someone would have to pay full price because of deductibles, etc., but I do think that the title is a bit misleading. it makes it look like those are their prices even with insurance. 
I was looking into this when I was seeking a new psychiatrist and a lot of the ones who didn't take insurance had long posts on their websites about how insurance companies force them to comply with passing health data onto the insurance company, so their only option to protect privacy (they feel) is to not accept insurance.
Yikes, HALF? I had never heard anything like that before. I had no idea.

Bullshit mental health care in this bullshit country. Let's just go make some more stealth bombers and let the severely mentally ill die on our streets. Why not?

I very much doubt that the founders are rolling in their graves about the health care system of the US. They were all old school liberals who wanted small government. They would not want universal health care. They weren't progressive or anything. Alot of them had slaves. Why do people think that they were these left wingers who wanted a social democrat utopia? They were old school right wing liberals who weren't even against slavery. 
Depends on the state. Some states didn't accept funding to expand Medicaid so you can be at an income where you don't qualify for Medicaid but don't make enough for subsidized health insurance.
They are nightmares and I'm glad to hear that you have been taken care of through disability. We can use any help we can get. :)
Oh man, that sucks. Do you have to pay 100% out-of-pocket then until you hit a certain number? That's such a low blow to people who are on any medication regularly. 
I'm okay because I have a $300 deductible and once I hit it my insurance company will pay 80% of all medical costs. I'm on Adderall for ADD, Lamictal & Wellbutrin for Bipolar and Trazadone to help me sleep. I can afford these medicines, although it's tough to have to come up with $300 out of pocket at the beginning of the year (insurance resets on Jan 1st). I did have to take $200 out of the joint savings account my fiance and I have though...

I posted this because it just makes people aware of the fact that there are people that are uninsured and can't get help because of these prices.
I can afford my copay, which was $125 today. Once I hit a deductible of $300 my insurance pays 80% of all medical costs. My point is that there are some people who can't afford insurance or who don't qualify. I can't get specific because I don't know a lot about insurance beyond my circumstances but I can say that someone with a part time job who is not on insurance can't afford seeing a doctor.
I bet the degree figures are combined for BS/MS/PHd degrees. The clinical psychologist positions are likely Doctorate level... 
Psych degree stat is probably bachelor's, as opposed to graduate level where you actually get one of those positions.
Aren't you just talking about bachelors degrees? 
Seriously??
I know there are a lot more expensive doctors & psychiatric services. I just saw this posted on the wall at my doctor's office and thought I'd share. It's still expensive for people who can't get on insurance.
I understand what you're saying, but my problem is with the fact that everyone doesn't have access to affordable services. Those are exorbitant rates for the uninsured, and surely stop people from accessing the care that they need. If you truly need these appointments here in BC at least, there may be a wait in some instances, but you will eventually get the care you need affordably. 
My deductible just increased to such an extent (like, by thousands) that I will not reach the annual limit with just my routine care. I'll only hit it if I have an emergency. So even with insurance, I'm still paying fully out of pocket for my chronic conditions. 

For me, and probably for plenty of other people, these *are* my prices*, even with insurance.

*not these literally but you know
It's very, very variable depending on what you're seeking treatment for. I know with the expanded Mental Health Parity Act that went through last year things should be better going forward, but when I sought treatment for my eating disorder in 2014-15, this was pretty typical. I had full coverage health insurance, but eating disorders were a loophole because they were neither here nor there in terms of mental vs physical health and required such specialized treatment. Eventually it all worked out and I only owed ~$6000, rather than $100k, after all the life-saving 100% medically necessary treatment I went through. 
Silly. Who taught you that?

If the founding fathers wanted small government, they would have stayed with the Articles of Confederacy. A small central government had already tried and failed here. They realized quickly that a stronger central government was necessary if anything was ever going to get done. If they didn't want a strong, federal government, they wouldn't have written the Constitution. 

"A lot" is two words.

What does slavery in the 1700s have to do with health insurance in the 2000s?

The founding fathers did not agree on everything. It's not really fair to say that they all felt one way or they all felt another way. It was a lot like government today. Some wanted a small central government initially, others thought a large central one was the only way it could work. Some had slaves and were okay with slavery, others did not and were not. 
> Some states didn't accept funding to expand Medicaid

so messed up.
As of right now, yes it looks like I will have to foot the majority of the costs until I hit the number they set before they start helping me out again. It sucks because I have a part time job, so I can't really afford the $500 for my viibryd, but it's helped me out so much better than other antidepressants I've been on and I don't want to be without it:/. It really is such a low blow, because the insurance company keeps screwing with me with that medication. There have been quite a few times where I was without it for a few days (cold turkey) until I could finally get a hold of someone at the insurance company to tell them the situation. The withdrawals during those times were absolutely horrendous. My doctor was livid when I told him what happened. 
Yeah, I'll have to look at a couple of the price sheets when I get to work today. Some of the places are willing to work with you based on income and personal situation... Others run just like a business and don't seem to care much. I always like the ones that are kind and care about their patients, they make me smile. 
That's very true. It's nice of them to actually just... Post it. So many places are very "secretive" about their rates and don't *really* want to tell you. 

Plus the amount of times I can remember a provider telling me how "difficult" a patient is even though they "were very upfront" about their rates and what they expected in regards to reimbursement... Yeesh.

I get such a good feel about these providers by working with them in this capacity, I wish I could pick one to be my doctor! Lol
You're right. I don't disagree that there needs to be an option for the uninsured - a real single payer option, not the expensive, high deductible plans that they have now. I think that Obamacare was a step in the right direction, but there was too much compromise for the insurance companies. Hopefully the new president elect will honor his previous statements to tweak Obamacare, not simply repeal it like so many right wing folks want to do. 
Me too. It doesn't even feel like I have insurance.
> My deductible just increased to such an extent (like, by thousands) that I will not reach the annual limit with just my routine care. I'll only hit it if I have an emergency. So even with insurance, I'm still paying fully out of pocket for my chronic conditions.
> 

That's bullshit. I would switch jobs (not saying that that's some easy solution or something!).
I hear you man.  It's pretty ridiculous how high the deductibles have gotten.  I mean, if you have a devastating illness or injury, you're better off, but for routine care (like you mentioned) you're no better off than being uninsured.  This is why I get so frustrated when I hear the figures touted about how many more people are insured than they were before the ACA went into effect - technically they're right, but in reality many people are no better off than they were when they were uninsured - except now they're being forced to pay for insurance that they can't even use.  
Oh god. That must have been awful to go through, all of it.

Hope you're doing better.
If they wanted a big government that provided health care then they wouldn't have gone for a federal government. And they certainly wouldn't have made the 10th amendment a thing. 

As for who taught it me it might be the several teachers and lecturers who've taught me politics. 

My point was that someone who believes slavery is morally right probably won't want universal health care. 

And is this for out-of-pocket people? Or those still paying off the deductible? 

I *just* lost my insurance so had to dump my therapist. She even offered a nice discount, and we were going to space the appointments out further, but when I finally calculated what all my medicine alone was about to cost per month, I just had to give up on that idea. 
I'm doing great now, thank you :) Recovery is wonderful and so incredibly worth it, but it makes me so so angry that it is so financially unattainable for some folks. Some people cannot get better without medical or professional intervention. I would have died if I hadn't been hospitalized. It shouldn't be a matter of insurance or money at that point. 
>My point was that someone who believes slavery is morally right probably won't want universal health care.

I mean.... they might have wanted it for white people.
Yep. It's common for it to be an across the board rate. Only some places I've seen actually offer discounted rates to people paying without insurance. 

Most of them just charge the same fee to **everyone** and take what they can get from the insurance company. Why do they do this, you may ask? 

Because the healthcare system in the US is so flawed and so immensely complicated I have yet to meet someone who actually knows how much they're going to get paid from an insurance company. 

Providers as an *organization* are required to sign contracts with insurance companies that are so convoluted it is nearly impossible to understand how much you'll get paid for each service from that ONE company. Multiply that by all the insurances they accept (a LOT) and it really only makes sense to charge a flat fee they know will "cover everything" and then just take what they can get. 

I wish this was more than just a little baby scratch at the surface, but it's not. It's just such a mess... It's awful. Healthcare shouldn't be allowed to be so much of a BUSINESS. It just makes everything terrible for the end user. 

Hope that made sense...I'm on mobile so this is mostly me typing as I think. Lol
Well that's nice of them then

Seriously, sometimes I don't understand what some people are trying to accomplish when they point out "flaws" that you clearly can't *just fix*.
Ugh, today I was having an anxiety attack, and my coworker who was checking on me-- right after I explained what the problem was-- went like, "Oh yeah your eyebrows are twitching." 

THANKS BRO. IT'S NOT LIKE I COULDN'T FEEL IT AND WASN'T HOPING THAT NO ONE WOULD NOTICE. 
I'm super underweight and I feel really awkward when people go "Why don't you eat much you're so skinny" like it's weird
Maybe I'm just weird but I like it when people tell me what's wrong with me. There are a few people in my life that are willing to say things like "Yeah, you're ugly, but that could be fixed if you ate more". The rest of everyone just says "Oh, you're so handsome, you're perfect, blah blah blah" which I know is a lie.  I'd much rather have someone point out my flaws than have them lie to me. When someone is willing to be honest with me and say that they think I'm ugly, it makes any compliments from them that much more meaningful. The people who lie to me, compliments mean nothing and make me doubt anything anyone else says.
What would be the correct way to offer your ear or comfort to someone you think is self-harming; like, a stranger?
Props for representing the thin as a bone people
Adults don't need a lesson like this. People aren't children, for crying out loud.
I think everyone I know does this. Including myself . 
Mostly trying to feel better about themselves.
Haha yes I understand this completely....I have naturally shaky hands and it gets worse when I'm nervous or haven't had anything to eat in a while. Its always on my mind and I'm always hoping no one notices/or points it out since I already know its happening!
I agree, honestly is always good especially between people who care about each other. I'm thinking this mostly relates in a more public setting like at work or school.

This issue has been personally bothering lately since my boss has made comments about eating habits/weight ("you're so skinny, you should eat more") at work but has no idea its because of medication and body image issues. Especially when its in front of other people and not in a caring manner.
It honestly depends on the situation. If I saw a complete stranger with scars or or something I would never comment on it. Cutting is a very personal and private thing so it might make the person feel violated. 

You don't know the story behind someones cuts, burns, and scars. It takes time for someone to open up about something like this. 
If you really feel the need to say something I would make sure its not a public setting (work or school) and maybe try to ease into it over a period of time?
I think it depends on who is pointing it out and how. Your mom saying "ya know, I think you've gotten a little thin and you'd look better if you ate more" is one thing. A random on the street pointing at you and yelling "UR A STICK" is just wrong. 
I feel awful then. I've had a lot of experience with depression and even a little self-harm so I feel like maybe they feel like I did- wishing for someone (a stranger) to just show they care. I was at the beach a week or two ago and saw someone with obvious cuts/scars on their arm and wound up casually saying, "oh, what happened?" I kind of regret asking because it was clear by her hesitation and her answer: "um... my pet." I awkwardly offered if she wanted a hug and wound up just saying "stay awesome" and walking away with my hot dogs ._.
Well it seems like you were coming from a caring place and maybe she realized it as well. I've gotten questions or weird looks before and the pet excuse is a common one. As long as you weren't overbearing or rude then its probably not as bad as you think.
Sometimes that's all you can do. 

When I'd cut for whatever reason a year back I'd say my cat did it and everyone believed it besides my two best friends and one of my teachers, who recommended me to the counselor, who believed the excuse.

My brother mentioned it a few times but to this day I'm certain he was joking based on how he acted.
I hope you're right.
Yeah... I just really hope I didn't trigger her or cause her any pain or discomfort.
How did it make you feel when someone mentioned it?
An odd mixture of frightened/nervous and happy, one of them being more depending on the person. 

If someone I didn't know that well pointed it out, I'd probably be more nervous, but ultimately quite apathetic. If I was closer to the person, the reasons for them changed, but for my brother it was just my nervousness, for closer friends who practically more my family, I was strangely quite happy, albeit a tad nervous in the center.

I'm not sure if that's what you wanted to hear (I doubt it), but people can be different.
Thank you for your response. I hope nowadays you are in a better place.

What would such a lesson consist of? Recognition and supporting yourself/others? It's a heavy topic to be teaching to children so I hope they do it well.
Suicide prevention? Seriously? 

Shouldn't it be 'mental health', seeing as suicide is the end of the line for a lot of illnesses? 
I'm a little unclear on whether the education is for teachers or for students. Is the goal to provide teachers with the tools to help potentially suicidal students, or is it to teach students how to spot potentially suicidal peers.

I don't think we will thus I hope it doesn't happen
It should be both...

In my opinion, the top picture is exactly how a person with depression feels like on the inside. 
The bottom picture shows what many people are told to try.....'fake it till you make it'.

I don't really like that thought process, because if someone is particularly ill and they fake it no one will know. 
It's how the smile ends at the eyelids but doesn't go in
/r/im14andthisisdeep
Well, that's kinda what I meant. 
He said how it looks not how it feels
Or on the outside sometimes if you're alone...
It's actually proven that behaving as if you're happy is an excellent way to fight depression.  "Half smile" and other similar emotion regulation skills are used in DBT and tons of other effective therapies.
well put
What
What's your problem?
If that's true for someone, they're probably not that depressed. 
Smiling as therapy might actually be a viable strategy for people with light forms of depression. However, being told to "snap out of it" or "fake it til you make it" won't help people with more grave forms or even clinical depression and might prevent them from getting the medical attention they need.
It actually makes me feel worse because I just can't fake like I am happy when I am in the middle of a depressive episode.

I have schizophrenia. My biggest issue is that people assume that my reality is flawed and theirs is correct. The real lesson of mental health isn't that there is a right or wrong reality. It's that it's different for everyone. Which is the truly frightening part. That no one sees the same reality. Whether you like it or agree doesn't matter cause it's the fundamental truth. Only you experience existence your way. And think otherwise is the real shared delusion. 

I don't think we'll move forward dismissing the stigma until people come to terms with it. But I'm not sure it's something you can understand unless you've experience a break from "reality". 
You are 100% right! If we are talking about the sale thing what you describe is called constructivism
I remember reading a case study(s) by Oliver Sacks, and he draws the conclusion that reality is the product of our brains prediction system. Our experiences are created by firstly our innate system for intergrating sensory data into a representation of reality. As time passes new experiences add to our prediction model, and how we proccess the sensory data we perceive. You heard about the stress-diathesis model?

You mention you are schizophrenic, your perceptions are actually created the same anyone else's are. The associated activity in certain regions of seeing say a tree be it real or not is the same. However due to your disorder your brain doesn't intergrate sensory data in the proccessing of some of your perceptions so you experience hallucinations. This can happen in people with a wide range of disorders, such as tumours, seizures, brain damage, drugs. Anything that disrupts communication between that prediction model and sensory data from your perceptions. So your brain prediction model is no longer grounded by your senses, so it creates hallucinations as this system is always going. 

Charles-bonnet syndrome is a good example of this, people who lose their vision, can sometimes start to have very vivid hallucinations because they have no visual data to restrain their brain, and if the brain does one thing it is make stuff up if Doesn't have the right information. Of course often patients enjoy these hallucinations, they get to see again and it is rarely terrifying or scary because it doesn't have the delusions that you might have experienced with schizophrenia. 

I personally understand where you are coming from I am autistic so I mean I perceive a reality which is slightly different because I process sensory data it differently, because it isn't shared it is dismissed. I also have experienced hallucinations, minor only a radio voice, when I was highly stressed but I maintained insight.  Basically most people whose brains work as the norm, will have normative proccessing of that sensory data and follow a similar prediction model, so they perceive similar things. That is the shared experience.

Now I mean say if you have been abused or let's say theoretically you have say BPD, in BPD you can often get paranoid right, you think people will abandon your or hurt you. I mean I am stretching my psych knowledge here but you don't have a sensory data integration/communication issue. You have a prediction model issue because it has been changed by your life experiences and of course at times you will mispercieve things, might feel paranoid. Of course also you might have innate problems which make you more predisposed to your experiences 

Yeah I totally get your point, and I mean I think it can be applied to most if not all mental health disorders, and it can be rather empowering. However, I would say it doesn't mean people shouldn't be treated because their subjective reality could be harmful to them, or perhaps others.

Disclaimer: pre-entry psychology student I know nothing still. Someone ought to correct my mistakes. I also massively oversimplified.
Yes, I live with a family like this and for the past few days it has been hell, because they simply don't understand. They try to brush it off by saying "I'm sorry" or don't even bother saying anything at all. It doesn't help that my family has two educated health professionals but alas, they lack the knowledge about stuff like this. I wish they could sit down with me and let me air my feelings out as much as I want instead of just stigmatizing them. They way they understand things is not the only way. I really doubted if I was truly dealing with mental illness when  people called me a basket case or attention whore.
Not many people care about something until it has effected them directly or a loved one 
I have worked in psychiatry my entire adult life. About 10 years ago I watched a simulation of how patients with a/v hallucinations lived a day based on their description. I put on headphones and looked into what was similar to a screen you put your eyes up to at an optometrist and watched the scenario. 
It completely opened my eyes for the first time how real it all was for those experiencing that. I absolutely would have had no way to tell if others were seeing the same things if I didn't know I was watching a simulation. It completely changed my views and perspectives on treatment as well.
Just commenting so i can come back later on to re-read the thread and comments if need be. 
I have a basic understanding of constructivism but can you expand or be more specific about what you mean? 
Firstly. Thank you for the detailed response. Truly enjoyed that. 

Secondly I'm not saying don't treat or help people. Mainly this was fuelled by a discussion I had with a friend who was recently diagnosed with anxiety and went on meds. It completely changed his point of view on mental illness making him more understanding. But it also made him see the world as the sick and the normal. And those who are sick or different can just be fixed with medication and therapy. Whereas my issue was when / if you detach enough there is no longer a difference. Sick/Normal. Hallucination/reality. The foundation these concepts are based on are what disappear. You don't just confuse them. The difference simply ceases to exist. I don't know how else to explain that. 


And no worries. I got what you meant. I have a degree in psychology. The field interested me so I studied it. Then had my first episode after graduating haha luckily my education helped me understand what I was going through. 
I feel you. Sometimes all you need is an ear. Not an opinion. Just an ear. 
That's a sad truth about life
From the basic knowledge i have in this philosophic notion : Reality is not a fact independent of context. It is a construction of what everyone sees. 

For exemple, remember the big internet story of that dress that people saw white and others saw it blue? You have many ways to answer to the question : what colour is the dress? Some will say it is blue and rely and experiments to prove WHY it is blue. Constructivists will say "some see a colour, others saw it differently, HOW does it happen". 

Phenomenology came from constructivism and helped a lot in changing our views on people suffering from schizophrenia. Thanks to that, asylums were dismantled 
I know what you mean I was trying so hard to get into medicine, to be a physician. After a break up and my friend dropping out of school. First it was strange... Nothing... Then I couldn't switch off, I slept but I was awake. Then I started to hear things, first I thought it was sleep paralysis... But then it happened and I was wide awake. Like a garbled radio voice, then I saw like silhouettes, and I was scared so I ran out of that place must have looked very weird from an outside perspective. I can't describe it, my mind felt ill, then eventually it felt good, but feeling good probably wasn't the case as I remember slicing at my hands and drawing with my blood in front of people, remember feeling extremely uncomfortable thinking people were talking about me... Thankfully things returned to normal after a month or a week... and I monitored my thoughts.

Until recently it started again and of course I had a friend pointing out how crazy I sounded so I thought right time to go the doctors, so I go and explain myself. Then he starts asking the standard psychosis question battery. The smartass I am, I reply "are you asking if I am psychotic?". Internally I am thinking oh Damn, see I thought I made sense, but clearly I didn't. Thankfully this time no progression like before. Yet I am scared of losing insight, yet when I do I won't realise until I regain it. So in your case yeah as you mention your detachment is enough that you actually wouldn't know the difference. In my case I still maintained at least partial insight. Thankfully I have put myself in the position of actually getting assessment/treatment soon.

I suppose it is because your brain experiences hallucinations as real because the way that experience is proccessed and percieved Is the same as actually perceiving something "real". The only difference is the brain has trouble grounding it's processes or communicating with other brain regions to intergrate the sensory data properly to perceive something most people would agree to be true. So does delusion come from experiencing a reality that is different, and having that reality dismissed or does delusions inform the potential hallucinations. I mean you can have delusions without hallucinations, you can have delusions and be totally functional as it is so specific. Yet aren't these just misperceptions too? Just involving different processes.

I just hope that whatever it is I can manage it, and I can do the grad entry route for medicine, and pass the fitness to practice. 


I see. Then yes. I agree we are talking about the same thing. 

As a "functional" schizophrenic I no longer worry that I sometimes see the world as differently then others. But as you say how and maybe why. Like hallucinations, to me anyway, are the strangest thing I've experienced. To be in a room with three people then have two of them tell you one isn't there also when you can see hear and feel them. It puts doubt into everything you've ever experienced. Everything. And once you can't trust your own reality, You never trust anyone's. Like they say you can't love if you don't love yourself. 

So my point is treating it as the collective reality versus the individual isn't the right mindset. It should be about building a new shared reality not trying to integrate an individual back into their perceived old one. Which probably wasn't that good or healthy for them anyway if they disconnected. Atleast that was my case. 
Good luck man. Truly mean that. In your pursuits and in finding balance in your mind. 

Keeping insight is the hardest thing. For me the delusions came before the hallucinations. Because of my education I was able to cope and dismiss symptoms so my first episode lasted six straight months before I crashed and ended up hospitalized. 

My delusions created the narrative for my hallucinations so when they began they fit into reality as I saw it. So when other people didn't see them I assumed they were the sick ones and were hallucinating which turned to paranoia and so on. And yes some feel good. The mania helps with that. Overall it's a ride that you really don't have any control over the first time. I've had three episodes in total in the last four years so I now know when I'm slipping. 

Congrats on being in a position and being mindful and insightful enough to ask for help. Now the hard part begins of finding balance. 

For me I've withdrawn and focus mainly on my exploring my psyche (full disclosure I test my limits with psychedelics and mediation) I'm blessed that my life allows for it as I have a strong support network and am relatively symptom free. Not many people are so lucky. 
I feel for you. I hope you find people that make you comfortable. It is a chronic disease but mental health is in constant evolution... you can live a good life with the symptoms of schizophrenia
Thank you. It's not so bad. I'm one of the lucky ones. I'm actually much happier. Once you accept who you are. Mental illness or not. Life changes for the better. 

Every so often a thought pops in my head that reminds me that if I had lived 100 years ago with the same mental illness(es) I have today, I probably would have either been locked away or "dealt with" because I was an "inconvenience."
Wow... what a sad world we live in.
mentally ill should go to jail... what the hell?  
i mean, the part about killing schizophrenics sounds like regular fucked up eugenics but jail? sounds like a serious consideration
I often think that too. 

It's sad how they were dealt with way back when. Locked up and chained to a wall 24/7, degraded and shit. Treated like absolute filth.

I would have written 'lol' under 'tossed salad' as well!

Do you think that capitalism, the current way society values money and possessions etc leads to depression? Have you re-evaluated your relationship with money and material things? 
i enjoyed this, thanks fellow suicide survivor. 
This is pretty interesting.  I worked in a psychiatric unit for a while and I met many people who had recently attempted suicide.  It's really interesting to read this candid account from the perspective of a patient.  You definitely captured some of the truly unique nuances of a psych unit.  I hope you're doing much better now!  Get back to Iowa yet?
>They play a lot of Kenny G here, considering they don't want us to kill ourselves.

I am glad that you are alive with me today.
I was released from a psych ward 3 weeks ago with a few notebooks of my own. Your post was a reminder of how alone we feel, but how many kindred spirits we actually have in the world. Seriously, why do they never put out enough coffee?!
I never bothered using the notebook they gave me at the psych place except to write down two phone numbers that I never actually used and a doodle of a giraffe. Sadly I didn't take it with me.
[deleted]
Tnx for sharing. It waa therapeutic for me (i am not suicidal just very down today because of horrible news) 


On a scale of fucked up to potato I really enjoy that you shared your psych ward journal. 

And yes, 92% of those who are trans are on tumblr... because Yahoo! Answers is a horrible place.
I was on a ward for 4 days earlier this year. Always wondered why they didn't trust me with a fork but let me have a scalding hot cup of decaf with every meal. I mean, I wasn't even allowed to keep a book in my room at first in case I tried to cut myself with the pages. The gown they gave me on my first day had long drawstrings, but I had to take the drawstrings out of my actual pants. One of the nurses let me take my shampoo bottle into the shower with me, the other only let me take a little medicine cup full in. It was a funny place. I wasn't laughing then, but I can laugh now.

Anyway, thank you for sharing your notes, they were a fascinating, heartfelt and amusing read. I hope that you're continuing to move onwards and upwards after that low point. All the best!
This was incredibly insightful to read. I'm pretty sure I still have the notes I kept when I was in the hospital overnight after taking an overdose a few years back. I'll have a look and share them if I find them.
i love counting crows too
How old are you?
It's amazing how within 3 days you "felt better about life than I ever have", considering you just attempted suicide not long before, which shows there is always hope even if you can't see it.
that was an abrupt change in tone
That Lol is the funniest thing I'll ever write. 

Your question could be the subject of a thesis paper. There were a lot of factors that lead to my suicide attempt, but chief among them was the fact that I hadn't paid rent that month and only had $30 in my bank account. Did capitalism cause me to attempt suicide? Yes and no. Do I see money differently? I no longer think it's worth dying over.
We're all in this together
I'm back in Iowa, yes! I'm going to be here through the winter
Haha! Thanks. I'm glad to be here
At first I assumed they just left a lot of room for cream and sugar, but 1/2 the cup? That's unreasonable.
You are arrogant. Just like me. Friends.
I would love to see them
Someone in the ward recommended I check out that song, because I made my attempt around 5 am on a Tuesday
21
Three days to think over what I had done gave me a clear perspective on my life and helped me feel good about it again. Thanks for reading!
I suppose it was! 
I thought the thing about Kenny g was pretty funny
I really think that the way we live, the way the dominant ideology encourages us to be, is inherently damaging and goes against what we need as humans, for our physical and mental health. 

I'm glad you're still here. I've suffered from depression for a very long time, and i do understand how you could get into a position from which you thought suicide was the only escape. Thank you for sharing your experience. 
Also: What nuances are you referring to?
Good to hear! If you ever find yourself in that position again keep in mind that there are lots of helpful people on Reddit you can reach out to. For your current situation, since debt reduction seems to be a big concern/goal check out r/personalfinance if you haven't already. They're pretty good over there. 
I'm still thinking about your notes today. If you have a blog or some other Internet presence and you don't mind, I'd love to follow you. Your post came at a good time for me.
It's their way of controlling us. To be honest, I just think the nurses couldn't be bothered to make more coffee. Also, if you're in a dual diagnosis ward with people who are on methadone, the coffee goes faster because they crave sugary drinks and will pour dozens of packets in that half a cup. They put me in a dual ward and I learned a lot about addiction, namely that I never want to add that to my list of problems. Poor guys. 
Oh, I just saw this one. I'm sure there's more I could have come up with last night when I had just finished reading, but the music, the golf pencils, the variety of people, the fact that you found a sort of psych ward buddy. All of the younger people almost always found a buddy that they got close with. Oh and of course the decaf coffee. Decaf coffee was completely central to the one I worked on. Some people believed it to be caffeinated which was interesting. There was once a guy who had some tea bags among his personal belongings and they became a sort of contraband currency for 2-3 days. 
Self promotion is my jam
@waylor_tilliams for twitter and instagram
youtube.com/taylorontheinternet

The staff at the one I was at had two coffee pots out. One was "regular" and the other was decaf. That's what they told us.

I know that they were both decaf, and that pissed me off. Hahaha. That was my biggest gripe about the stay I had at the one here. Though, I didn't make any friends like OP did. I kept to myself. My roommate was discharged and came back the same day though ... don't think that counts. But I said "hi" to her anyway.
That's a story I would love to hear
Well, at my unit we had a cabinet behind the nurse's station where there were boxes with the client's possessions that they came in with.  For the most part they were not allowed to access them but sometimes they were allowed to ask for certain personal effects from them.  One guy somehow had a bunch of tea bags with him.  I guess he really liked tea.  He'd convinced at least one of the nurses that they should give him tea bags when he asked.  As he did this some other patients took notice and within the day they became a sort of contraband.  This unit may have had even more people dealing with addiction than average due to the area where it is and the word on the street was that tea was not allowed.  I'm not even sure if that's true, but it wasn't provided by the staff so it was at least a novelty.  The mentality that many people held toward drugs quickly took over and the tea bags were traded for, hidden, and stockpiled.  Some people really just wanted tea, but I think many of them just saw it as entertainment or a way to get over on the staff.  Mostly all the staff members knew what was going on but the patients weren't sure of this so they proceeded to be extremely sketchy concerning the tea which was pretty funny from an outside perspective.  The original tea smuggler was in and out within 2 days but upon leaving he basically flooded the market by distributing all his remaining tea to his favorite people.  Within a day or two I guess everyone had consumed all the tea but for a while it was pretty good entertainment.
That sounds soooo funny! Thanks for sharing

Yeah, the first text made me side-eye, but I still like the sentiment of "treat yourself like you'd treat others" and find it helpful to be reminded. I'm constantly going out of my way to make other people feel good but I say/think the most horrible shit about myself, which doesn't make any sense. 
You're lucky to have a friend like this. For myself, my family would just be like "stop crying you're okay"
The idea of treating yourself like you would your best friend is great.  I forget what it's called, but we talked about it in my Positive Psych lectures. 
"Just be happy." - "Oh Gee, thanks, why didn't I think of that?"

Ugh. I hate this crap. Sorry you have to deal with that OP. You could try telling them it's not that simple, and if it's **really** a good friend, they'll understand. Or at least try to.
So your "friend's" idea of being helpful is to be a rude, overbearing ass to you.

They sound like a *lovely* person who is *definitely* helping your mental health long-term.  
We are our own worse critic.  If you ever need to talk, message me.   
I use drugs when I get really depressed.  Well, the other day I was so messed up that my family noticed.   They have been marathon calling and trying​ to get me help since.  I am very fortunate to have the family that I do.  As well as the friends I do.

I am so sorry you don't have that familial support, but I am here if you wanna cry together.  Big hugs. 

 
He was just reminding me to be kind to myself and I deserve it.  Though I totally feel where you are coming from.
Dude, this isn't "snap out of it", it's a reminder to consciously avoid depressive ruminations which is a pretty significant therapy goal.
They were reminding OP to focus on pre-established goals. It sounds like they have spoken about OP's mental health before. To me, "I thought healing started" was a reference to something OP must have said in an earlier conversation. Maybe you are projecting because you lack a support system? 

"Just be happy" is very different from "get your head in the game". 

You kind of sound like a dick, honestly. "Okay". This is Reddit, not a place to post comments to strangers like passive aggressive text messages. And this is a mental health thread, why would you bash someone who is happy to receive an endearing message? 
He honestly is an ass most times.  I just found this moment endearing.
OP has self-esteem issues? Better tell them their friends are shite!
thank you, kind stranger! same goes to you. and anyone who may be reading this.
Well, I certainly read it that way. But that's kinda the problem with written conversation, you can't really get the intention behind it.
You are on point.  He and I were discussing healing just the night before.   Then I was having a rough day and he reminded me of the promise I made myself.   It definitely was not a "get over it" message.
Ah, reddit, where letting someone know you've read what they said and that, while you personally disagree with it, think it's okay if they're okay being treated that way gets you dogpiled.  Such fun!  Will definitely be using this subreddit in the future!
Okay
Your friend has self-esteem issues?  Better treat them like shit until they learn not to be sad around you!
That's totally fair.
He was reminding me of a previous conversation.  I thought this was enough context for most without​ posting the whole thing.  Perhaps I was wrong.  But he was being encouraging.  This post is not in support of telling people to get over it, just a reminder every day is a battle and it's good to have good allies.  
Do you need to talk?
Shit how?   You have a small snippet of YEARS of conversations. Yes, years.   And sometimes he can be hard on me.  But nine out of ten times he is encouraging me to keep promises to myself and keep fighting.  I was talking really down on myself before he said this. . . and suggesting getting my tent from my parents and living on the street and just 24 hours after I said I would start healing and doing better to stay the course. We all need reminders, even if sometimes they may not seem perfectly worded.  


Edit:  I don't see this text as assholish because I have it in context, which I have tried to explain.   If I offended others by having a support system​, I apologize.  I found it endearing, and actual good advice for most of us (considering it is a mental health sub).   I try to reach out to others who seem in need because I know it is hard to ask.  If doing so helps one and gets me called a troll by another. . . So be it.  I just refer quickly to a post history and that's usually enough to engage and build a support system, we all need. If I hit a sore spot or came off insensitive, please please please know it is not intended.
Note to self: do not feed the trolls.
I don't know how often I have to tell you that if you're okay with people treating you this way, then more power to you, before it sinks in.
**LifeProTip:** Stop sending unsolicited, fat-shaming, insulting PMs to people if you genuinely want to talk to them or help them.
> You have a small snippet of YEARS of conversations

Okay.  And that "small snippet" has your "friend" talking to you like an asshole.  But if you're okay with people treating you like that, then more power to you.

Yea mom

I wish Singapore allowed dogs for anxiety and depression too :c 
I would take it back as it seems to be defective. I've been staring at your anxiety/depression dog for the past minute and I don't feel any more depressed or anxious :P

Seriously, cute pupper
He's a cutie!

i love this so much!

I have seen your other drawings and poems and liked all of them. You are really creative and talented. :)
Lovely!
I work in inpatient psych, and seeing the artwork of my patients is consistently one of the "little things" that unexpectedly makes my day from time to time. As someone with zero skill at visual arts I'm legitimately amazed by the awesome stuff truly talented things people create, and what I see art do for them.

Hope you're doing well. Thank you for sharing.
This is pretty cool. 
Thank you :)
You're welcome. :)

Fantastic article! Thanks for sharing.
Wonderful article! Glad to see this.

Can someone ELI5 this for me ? 
I love it! That's a very cute placement, too. I've considered getting a semicolon tattoo myself. Getting through life with mental illness is tough, and I could use a reminder to keep going and to be proud of myself when I do. 
I'm curious, how much did you pay for that tat?
The kink in your ear is so lovely. Tattoo placement is also very nice, but the ear actually was what I noticed first. 
Nice tattoo! Simple but powerful.
If I understand right, the semicolon represents a sentence (or in this case, the tattood person's life) nearly ending, but then not. 

It's a survivors mark to remind themselves of what nearly happened 
Yes. As stated before, a writer uses a semicolon when they could have ended the sentence but chose not to
Thank you hunny for the support 
£20
Awh thank you hunny ..I'm self conscious about my ear tho 😖
Thank you hunny 
Thank you for this. 

For me it was the bullet that was in the gun that I planned to kill my self with.   

Maybe one day I will make it into a charm for a necklace.  
Ironically though, the founder of Project Semicolon killed herself.  For some, the battle with depression is particularly grueling.
I love how your ear piercing seems to match your ear shape so well. It's very beautiful!
Project dangling modifier.  Project sentence fragment.  Project unresolved literary tension.   

Physical exercise can help for depression, but people dont realize some people are so depressed that they can't get out of bed! 

One thing I have found that involves less effort is spending some time outside when it's still light out. You get sunlight which helps with Vitamin D, something that can raise your energy levels. You'll also get fresh air, which is better than being indoors all the time.

These are 2 tips a psychiatrist gave me (physical exercise and going outside). The others were taking fish oil, a probiotic, getting enough sleep, and eating well. Those are more realistic to start out with. Also pilates is a great mix of physical exercise and relaxation like yoga. But most important to remember is that what works for you may not work for someone else, or something that works for someone else might not work for you. I do get the point of people assuming one thing is the answer: it's all about self care, which uses multiple daily practices to make lifr better!
Anyone else who is severely depressed even when they are able to do exercise? 

I often think "I've been cycling for 2 hours today, why am I still suicidal?"

The truth is that exercise can take the edge of, but it doesn't solve my internal and external problems.
Yes yes yes. I used to go for runs with tears streaming down my face. I thought I wasn't going fast enough or far enough. People kept telling me exercise would cure me, why wasn't it working? 

Because I had a chemical imbalance that the "runner's high" couldn't fix. Now that I'm more stable, exercise will help my mood a bit, but it's always temporary. It's like a band-aid when I really need stitches.
I'm sure it helps when your experiencing a "normal" depression that most people go through once in their life at least. But when you are clinically depressed and your hormone levels are way off, I really don't think it helps, nor that it is doable. 
Yeah, there is legitimate science there, but at the same time, everyone is different and sometimes you can run (Northeastern US checking in) and sometimes you can't get out of bed! Personally, I like going on walks when I'm depressed, but I stopped doing that because one time, someone called the cops on me and they sent me to a mental hospital.
This advice irritates me intensely. I know it is well meant but some of us have joint problems making running impossible.
I don't even go for walks anymore. I don't enjoy it at all. I tried some weeks ago I even brought music to try and help me relax and I just couldn't enjoy it, it felt almost painful for me. I would always think about coming home and I walk so fast (I'm thinking like that's due to anxiety same with eating too fast esp with other people around). It also made me feel even more lonely and like an outcast (the story of my life). Last summer my therapist tried to get to me walk two times a day for at least 30 minutes and I was so exhausted it made me even worse sleeping hours throughout the day I was tired all the damn time. That doesn't even reach the other mental hurdles i.e. I would get bad dandruff and that embarrassed the hell outta me and made me so uncomfortable (that's an understatement lol). It's a huge mental and physical struggle for anyone in my boat. Also I don't think it's a great solution for someone with anxiety who can get a fast heart rate already, mixed with all this exercise seems dangerous. I had this problem in the hospital after hours of walking (in result of "wanting to escape"). In the mental hospital I had an unusually high heart rate for a young person (I could hear the doctors discussing me in another room lmao) they had to check my vitals more than the other patients.
I wont tell you to go for a run, instead i suggest you to get under a cold shower. As cold as it gets and stay there for at least a minute. If when coming out you are not a whole new person i will eat my own underwear. Try it and report back.
Exactly! Big fan of pilates because of exactly that reason. I'm hoping that now spring is here I'll be able to get more time outside. 
What does fish oil do?
It's important to remember that mental health is infinitely complex. It's totally normal to expect certain results from your actions, (why else would you do them), but expectations can lead to a host of bad thoughts and feelings if they're not met. You expect to feel better while excercising, so when you don't, you feel frustrated, demoralized, or even more deeply depressed due to a sense of personal failing. I don't have any insight on how to best combat that, but it can be very helpful to try and divorce the emotional aspect of your expectations and activities.

Best of luck!
Yeah. When I'm focussing on the next rep I'm not thinking about killing or harming myself. When I get out of the shower afterwards and see myself in the mirror, bam, there it is. Lol.
do not agree. each person is different, some can't even think of going out, others with depression as worse may benefit from going out for a jog. 
running has specific physiological effects, it does not cure ANY mental illness, but it can many times provide a short diversion from constant anxiety and depression. 
Even having major depressive disorder, getting exercise does help for a little while. The thing is, it's really hard to even get to the point of doing it. It definitely doesn't help when people repeat it though, because we'd do it if we could. It's not like we can just "buck up" and do it. It's not like we're procrastinating.
100% agree. It's well-meaning, but it's not a magic fix. 
did you just get elitist about depression? only reddit lol 
Maybe swimming instead?
You sound like someone who would definitely benefit from some more physical activity. Hell I think you should do martial arts like boxing or muay thai. Ive seen even small, fragile girls do muay thai. It would condition you not to panic about every minor scratch or sensation.
It promotes overall brain health, which includes reducing mood disorder symptoms. Here's a general article about it: http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/fish-oil-to-treat-depression
insightful. Thanks
I'm not saying it doesn't help to a certain degree, but I'm questioning how much it actually does help. I don't think the depression will be gone. 
Hahaha shit that wasn't my intention at all. I'm just saying sometimes. there's more to it. 
Yep, I need to do something.
No, it's definitely not a cure-all! However, running or brisk walking is something you could do just like eating healthy and sleeping well are supposed to help with depression.
For me, it takes my mind off of things. That's why it only helps a little bit. A couple hours to half a day later and it's back to normal. I also don't exercise in a gym. Being outdoors on a hike or bike ride is the only way I can do it.

Great read. Good tips and makes complete sense to someone with depression. Hopefully can help others understand and those effected know they aren't the only ones who feel this way. 
good (& accurate) read
This is simply an ad.  The point is to make money, not help people with the real life reasons they're depressed.

An ad for what?
For all the "mental health" profiteering that exists to hide and quiet the  public's suffering.  

The drug peddlers just label and drug people, not help them solve any real life problems.  Therapists just take your money while giving you nothing but words, not real life solutions to your real life problems.  (ie the cause of the depression.)







I'm pretty darn sure you didn't read the article. It actually gave good advice, the section on getting out of bed was exactly how I started quantifying my recovery. I opened the article expecting to be unimpressed at best and was pleasantly surprised.

Your critiques have a level of validity, but there are a lot of different therapies and therapists. Sometimes medication does actually help people. It's good to be skeptical but try to be skeptical of your own beliefs as well. I am with you, the state of mental health care isn't good but there is strength to be gained in trying and sometimes you do actually find the help you need.
> Sometimes medication does actually help people

Psychiatrists do not make the drugs, they violently deprive people of the drugs unless psychiatrists are paid.  They're essentially acting as pill middlemen, which is parasitic and cruel to the public.

Also, the drugs are not "medicine" because some (alleged) behavior/feeling is morally disliked.  (Is viewed as bad.)  The "medicine" is just drugs.

>  there are a lot of different therapies and therapists. 

For many people they offer no help and just take your money.  And yet *everyone* is told "seek help" from these profiteers.  






Huh. I've never met anyone with this view.

Lemme make sure I understand you correctly: you believe that the thing we call "depression" is a real entity, something that would occur spontaneously even in the absence of suggestion from the mental health industry (the pill-pushers and big brother Pharma and the therapists etc). And you believe, at least in part, that it stems from our real-life problems (the ones that therapists fail to help us with)... and from our biology too? However, the mental health industry offers false promises, saying that therapists will help when they don't (even though they're perfectly happy to take our money). And the drugs could aid in alleviating the depression but the psychiatrists won't give us the drugs unless we give them money.

Do I have that right? Where can I read more about similar viewpoints?

Edit: clarification
> "depression" 

**Psychologytoday.com:**

> By calling sadness “depression” or restlessness “attention deficit disorder” it secretly imputes biological causes for which there is no evidence. They want us to believe that biological abnormality is at play, so that they can prescribe drugs, without having to frankly say that there are biological abnormalities at play, which might require that they prove their assertions.  

-- [psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rethinking-psychology/201207/the-great-dsm-hoax)


Depression (sadness) is an emotion/feeling and the result of people's real life problems.  There is no mystery, it's exactly what it appears to be, but society tries to hide that by pretending it's a disease.

However many people's sadness/depression is related to things which may not be obvious to them (eg a lack of sleep) or they may be in denial of whatever is causing them to be so sad.  So they pretend it's a disease.  

And everyone else does too because (to normal people) it's a lot easier to just pretend everything's fine and take pills than to solve real life problems.

> And the drugs could aid in alleviating the depression but the psychiatrists won't give us the drugs unless we give them money.

That's an undeniable fact.  That's how psychiatry works.

Interesting. So when real-life sadness results in people flinging themselves off buildings, that's unfortunate but still neither pathological nor biological in origin? And when a person takes a week off of work because, in their words, "I have depression and I can't get out of bed," is that... un-addressed sadness? Moral failing? Laziness?

And just to clarify: do you believe that antidepressants alleviate our non-biological sadness or not? 

Thank you for sharing your views; this is interesting. 
>  that antidepressants alleviate our non-biological sadness or not? 

You're twisting my words.  Depression isn't caused by *biological damage*, but that doesn't mean it's "non-biological." 


When people say "X emotion has real life causes, it's not *caused* by biology flaw" it's not saying that the emotion in general is not biological.  It's saying the *cause* of the emotion is from real life (eg pain + a hammer).  The *cause* is real life things.


And drugs can change feelings/emotions in ways that some people like.

> I can't get out of bed [because of "depression" is that... sadness?

Yes.

> Moral failing? Laziness?

No and no.  You're trying to change the topic.  You can't catch depression. It's just an emotion and some people deal with it with more strength than others.




I should have been more careful with my words; I meant "not the result of biological damage." Not an intentional word-twisting. I'm not trying to trap you into saying something that is easy for me to pounce on; I'm genuinely interested in your viewpoint. 

How do you think that sadness should be addressed? (Say someone felt sad all the time and was unable to identify why. Therapy doesn't help and drugs do not address the root cause. What should they do? How do they get more strength? Or, for that matter, what do you do/advise when you or others are persistently sad.)
> How do they get more strength? 

I never said that was an option.  Often "strength" is stupidity- it's often just blindly pretending things are fine.  

Some people pretend harder than others, and that's seen as "strength."

> What should they do [if drugs/etc don't help?]

It's very common for people who quit anti-depressants (because they improved) to have realized they had an extreme lack of sleep.  

If getting enough sleep doesn't work, the next thing is solving people's real life problems.  But that's often hard when the state is against the working class.

Imagine if someone's primary daily problem was economic related.  Therapists aren't exactly famous for helping people find better work, building cheaper housing, and so on.  

But even if they did "help", like giving a person such a dehumanizing label that it got them welfare, that's still more like a way to hide problems.  It does not solve the real life problems (eg that the economy is rigged to brutally destroy the lives of the working class and take every penny from their labor.)




Ah. Capitalism is the underlying cause of the thing that shrinks/pharma call "depression." "Sufferers" are told to seek therapy (which is ineffectual because it does not address the consequences of capitalism) and to take drugs (which also do not address the root cause of the sadness). Even access to state services doesn't help because even if that solves some of the practical problems, it obviously doesn't solve all of the other problems of capitalism. Is that close?

But okay... let's say that what you've outlined above is true. How, in your opinion, is a member of the working class who feels sad supposed to stop feeling so awful all the time? Our poor plebeian can fight capitalism all he wants, but that will neither make a dent in capitalist structures nor make him feel any better. Is he doomed to suicide?

Edit: words
> Ah. Capitalism is the underlying cause of the thing

You're twisting my words again.  I gave one example.  If people are oppressed in real life they're told to deal with their depression by handing over their money to a bunch of profiteering quacks who prey on them, but do not actually help them.

> Even access to state services doesn't help because even if that solves some of the practical problems,

It doesn't.  The state's welfare only hides problems that remain in general.  Often hiding problems the state itself creates.  

> is a member of the working class who feels sad supposed to stop feeling so awful all the time? 

One answer is drugs, ideally gained without any quack pill middlemen.

But often a better option is (for like the 15th time) to change the real life conditions we live under.  "Psychiatry" is used by the state to enforce the status quo- to pretend all the suffering the state creates is just "mental illness."  But really "mental illness" does not exist- behaviors/feelings which are disliked do exist, but they are not illnesses just because they are morally disliked.  (ie thought of as "bad.")





Yet the same people who wrote this article are against the social programs and kinds of health care that could prevent this.
That's what happens when kids have no hope in their future, hang in there everyone and look for the best in life
I recently conducted my doctoral dissertation on this topic, assessing the perspectives of middle school students on suicide and stigma. Lack of knowledge and education on suicide is a huge problem, as is knowing what to do for a friend who confides suicidal ideation. We need to bring education and awareness to our students so they are prepared to help their peers. 
Just like drug addiction, its too expensive to help out everyone who can't afford it. Its like economic survival of the fittest. Its really a shame.
That's because at face value it's a tragedy, but when you look at what it would take to fix it, the solution is just waaaaay too much complexity and possible taxes.

So I mean... is it really that important compared to getting paid?  Nah, let's just not try.
> t the social programs and kinds of health care 

That's a myth.  Psychiatric assault/torture is **not** linked to reduce suicide.  It's linked to making money for psychiatrists.

> look for the best in life

Taco Bell is still around...
>  We need to bring education and awareness to our students so they are prepared to help their peers. 

That could be great, assuming you're talking about not assaulting them.  Just being friendly/nice is the main thing a normal teen could do.

But what rulers need to do is big, eg changing the entire forced poverty economic system.  Change the forced indoctrination/"schooling" system that allows bullies to prey on other kids, and so on.

Things need to change, and the solution has nothing to do with "reporting" these teens for psychiatric assault/torture.

Such torture is **not** linked to reduce suicide. 

[Study: Psychiatric Interventions (kidnapping/enslaving people in prisons) Increase Suicide Risk](http://www.alternet.org/personal-health/research-suggests-psychiatric-interventions-admission-mental-facility-could-increase)
Is it important compared to being paid? I can't tell if your being sarcastic or not...

Anyway I know better than to fall for this trap. Think what you want, it's a fee country.
Lol what?! You know what anecdotal means right?

Edit: also this "article" doesn't even site it's sources
Hah yeah it was completely sarcastic. Should've added a  /s.
> Lol what?!

It no longer surprises me that people who advocate (and profit from) assault and torture act like trolls on the internet.

And the article says "in the September edition of the journal Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology."

ie, you're not being honest.

Here in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of young men. This fact has spurred us on to create a campaign to get men talking. We hope to keep a regular podcast as well as other bits of content to keep people engaged. Please take a look at our site and let us know what you think!
I don't live in the UK, but this seems like a good thing. We men tend either to suppress depression, or just don't know we're affected, when we are. 
Good stuff! 
Major upvote here! I am the editor of a community of writers devoted to mental health and chronic illness; I noticed immediately how few men write about their experiences with depression and illness. For every 10 female writers, I'm lucky to find one guy.

I'd love to feature this project to help it gain more attention! Let me know if you're interested.
IMO we also need to get to a point where it's no longer "I'm mentally ill" but it becomes "I have a serious problem that makes my life hard at times, and I'm open about what it is so you can help me"

Even though I guess I'm mentally ill it still puts me off. "mentally ill". It's like a barrier that separates me from "normal" people so they can be in good conscience not to worry about it. It's the problem that causes close-mindedness because we describe psychological factors with the term "illness" when all my problem is that my mood is unstable and my energy is extremely low. I wish people would think that of me and not "you're mentally ill you're excused but I won't bother with you"
Beautiful, wonderful thing you're doing here. Have my upvote.
Wonderful! There is such a great need for this. The "mucho man" culture in the US is also really bad and prevents men from talking about it and seeking help. I'm so thankful that my husband was able to be open about it with me and now we try to talk to others about it and help in any way we can. Followed you on facebook!
This is a very prominent issue, and I am glad you guys are trying to tackle it. It might not be the biggest killer everywhere, but if you look up statistics on the ratio, men successfully commit suicide more often than women almost everywhere. The root of the problem is in media and culture all over the world. Men have to be "manly" aka not allowed to show emotion other than anger, work hard, be successful, and a lot of other things depending on where you live. For a large portion of my depression I was actually scared to express any of my feelings because I thought I would be seen as weak and useless. 

here are some easy to find statistics
US -https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/

Worldwide https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide

And here's another good article to read about it http://www.bcmj.org/articles/silent-epidemic-male-suicide

I hope your site starts building up steam.

Edit: Line breaks
[deleted]
Good on you for doing this. Male suicide is appallingly high. Years ago I did a study on life expectancy and sex. If suicide, risk-taking behaviours, and workplace accidents are taken into account the life expectancy difference between men and women disappears entirely. Yet people keep using this myth that males have inferior genetics to excuse taking males health problems seriously. Good luck with this!
This is fantastic! I come from a background in male psychiatry and it is so true - we need to get men talking! 
Well done, this is such a fantastic piece of work. I work in mental health services in the UK, so I'll be sure to pass the link around with my colleagues! :)
My exact experience. Thanks for the support dude.
Wow, thank you! That would be immensely helpful!! We'd love to get involved in any way at all.
I hear you, man. I experience very similar lows in mood and it's really frustrating when you're trying to figure out what kind of person you are.

I agree to an extent with what you're saying too. Being defined with an 'illness' can be quite detrimental in some cases because there's so little scientific testing or backing, and so much guess work involved. Knowing that this is the case though, I'd encourage anyone who's experiencing this kind of struggle to seek their own way of defining it and working at it. For me, I like to shun the 'chemical imbalance' idea, and see it more as a collection of bad traits and psychological pathways that I've picked up as direct and indirect influence in my upbringing, which are made harder to deal with in today's culture which makes people feel like they're never quite good enough.
Thank you!
That's great, thanks for the support! We're starting fairly small, but we're aware of just how big an issue this is all over. Hopefully soon we can engage more people in the US. Thanks for being there when someone needed you too. It's a massive step for a guy to open up in today's society.
Thanks so much for the support and the info! Sounds like we're very much on the same lines here. As a guy who suffered in silence for so long, I can definitely adhere to what you're saying.
Good shout! Thanks for the advice.
Thanks! It'd be good to see that study - We're hoping to get provide analytical insight as well personal stories, so info like that would be quite useful.
That would be amazing! Thanks so much for the support!
It's literally the least I could do. 
I'm too poor to support this financially, too dysfunctional to help others, too distant to use the initiative, and too busy to start my own local thing. 
Good thing I'm an optimist! 
Wonderful! Just sent you a PM!
Well there's a lot of good in you from what I can tell. Optimism is a great thing to have, in my own experience I've found that if you feel that things could be better, you're almost always right.
Thanks for your kind words. Optimism is vital for me. 
Not everything goes well, but at least one learns something from it. And, it passes and fades in the past. 

there's no shame in it, more people than you think go through it
I cant imagine the hoops you had to jump thru to get what works for you.  
The fact it keeps you sane is all that matters :)
Celebrex, Lexapro, Seroquel, and what?
Wow, the title sounds like a beautiful verse of a poem.
I am lucky that I only have to take one pill a day, but without it.....you know.
Yeah I feel this way sometimes, though right now it's more like insanity in my hand with some of the side effects it causes.
yep same here. I agree with BChrist97 there is no shame in it. It's good that we live in a time when there are things to help us. Back in the day all of us would have been locked up and forgotten about.
[deleted]
I think it's an interesting concept that something inanimate and unfeeling can change, the way I feel and experience the world, so completely. The pill can't think or feel but it changes how I think and feel. 
Painkiller (tramadol), antipsychotic (resperidone), antianxiety-antidepressant (Cipralex) , anti-inflammatory, and a pill to combat the side effects of testosterone injections (D3) . 

Hah I could only identify three too. 
To me it seems like you are minimizing my experience by showing off that you take more pills? 
yeah it's a little scary, but hey that's the magic of science
How long have you been on meds? If you're new-ish it can take a while to get everything dialed in but you may well already know that.
How do you find you're liking the Risperdal? I have a friend who just started on it.
Gotcha.
Yeah? The long tanish one threw me off. Thought it was Seroquel XR.
6 and a half years of switching meds to find the right ones. The mental health ones seem to be working for now but the ones for pain barely take the edge off. I started at twelve, I'm almost nineteen. 
It's great! I don't hallucinate anymore. Although I lactate now. I'm told that's bad. More blood tests for me. Sigh. . . 
I self medicated with alcohol for many, many years. When I realized I was an alcoholic and finally quit the real world was a very unpleasant experience.
 She started lactation too. Her psych doesn't seem to care about it though. 
How much you lactate is a factor. How high prolactin levels are is a factor too. 

I am genuinely very pleased for you. Coming off SSRI's was a very big deal for me at the time and I know it's very likely big for you too.

However I do have a bit of a PSA here. Please don't discard leftover or out of date drugs in regular trash. Please take them to a pharmacy or medical facility where they can dispose of unwanted drugs properly. Thank you.
Liberation is when your symptoms don't return.    Best wishes on your recovery.
Congrats and I hope you stay well! If you have a relapse later, remember there's no shame in going back on medication. 
You have my biggest congratulation sir.


How did you manage to get off them?
Biggest Congratulation
Do you think you can go cold turkey from 100mg?
Congrats. 
Congrats! Antidepressants don't do much for me other than give me awful side effects. I've found that making other changes in my life works better than meds.

Just curious, is there a reason you have to chuck them properly? No one ever told me I had to.
Cut down to half dose, so I was on 200mg daily I cut down to 100mg daily. Did that for about two months, then cut down by half again so 50mg daily. After another couple of months I started taking once every two days rather than daily. Then every three days etc. etc. 

It was difficult. Lots of 'brain zaps' and other awful withdrawal symptoms. But I did it and it was worth it! 
How long have you been on them for? I really wouldn't recommend it. I went cold turkey on 100mg about three years ago and it was a horrible experience. Cut to 50mg first and stick to that for a couple of months 
To prevent misuse or redistribution of the pills, or poisoning of wildlife that get into the garbage. You can take the left over medicine to a medical facility or pharmacy as stated above, or to any police/sheriff department.
I think he may have meant, "What changed so that you no longer required medication?"
200 mg? Isn't that a lot, I thought that 150 mg was the max and 100 mg was the usual
Any tips for combating and dealing with the brain zaps? I've never been able to find a method that makes any difference but there has to be something out there to make them more bearable. 
What are brain zaps?
10 months. Thanks for that, will definitely ween 
Also the pills break down and leak into the water supply. 

>A study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1999 and 2000 found measurable amounts of one or more medications in 80% of the water samples drawn from a network of 139 streams in 30 states. The drugs identified included a witches' brew of antibiotics, antidepressants, blood thinners, heart medications (ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin), hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone), and painkillers. Scores of studies have been done since. Other drugs that have been found include caffeine (which, of course, comes from many other sources besides medications); carbamazepine, an antiseizure drug; fibrates, which improve cholesterol levels; and some fragrance chemicals (galaxolide and tonalide).

http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/drugs-in-the-water

Further down in the article:

>In contrast to the uncertainty about human health effects, there's quite a bit of evidence for pharmaceuticals in the water affecting aquatic life, particularly fish. Numerous studies have shown that estrogen and chemicals that behave like it have a feminizing effect on male fish and can alter female-to-male ratios. Sources of estrogen include birth control pills and postmenopausal hormone treatments, as well as the estrogen that women produce naturally and excrete. Intersex fish — creatures with both male and female sex characteristics — have been found in heavily polluted sections of the Potomac River. Studies of fish upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants have found more female and intersex fish downstream from the plants, presumably because of the higher estrogen levels in the downstream water. Other research has uncovered popular antidepressant medications concentrated in the brain tissue of fish downstream from wastewater treatment plants.

So fish are testing positive for antidepressants and all sorts of other pharms. It kills the bacteria and stuff that the ecosystem depends on. 

Don't flush them, either. 
Right, that was my question. 
It's the max. I used to be on 200 mg for 5+ years and recently tapered down to 150 mg.
They're a symptom of SSRI withdrawal. Your brain feels like it's getting "zapped". I don't know any better way to describe it. 

Source: have gone off and back on SSRIs multiple times. 
my guess is loads of therapy and lifestyle changes
Ah, I see. I was told that 100 mg worked best for depression, and 150 mg for anxiety, so I sort of just assumed
How much does it hurt? Does it feel like electricity or more like brain freeze?

In like 9 months I'll be off SSRI for the first time.
Not that much therapy actually but you're spot on about the lifestyle change. I moved cities so I became engulfed in a new environment, new job, new people and well, new everything really haha. That's what helped me the most! 
It doesn't really "hurt" per se. It feels like a jolt of electricity. Unpleasant, but not painful. 
that's awesome!

This really hit home for me. It isn't about politeness, it's about feeling unworthy. I'm really going to let this roll around in my brain.
Good thing I'm Canadian, eh?
Or say both. I apologise for my lateness, thank you for being so patient. 
It's not so much about the politeness of saying "sorry I'm late" but replacing a gesture of thanks with a statement that undervalues yourself (sorry I'm *always* so late). This takes away the value of what it is you're trying to communicate, and subsequently puts the other person in an uncomfortable position too. 

This is beautiful ❤

Glad you've found something that helps you cope with things you're maybe struggling with.
Art is a great coping mechanism. This is absolutely breathtaking. So glad you shared your talents here.
Wow you are really talented. Amazing. 
Thanks! My bad, I should clarify, this is not my own piece; I love admiring other people's art when I'm feeling down. You can find more of Tokuriki Tomikichiro's stuff if you Google it, and I also wrote something about this work on my blog [here](https://www.pixelle.co/tokuriki-tomikichiro/)! :)
Just to clear things up, this isn't my own art but it's by an artist I admire! You can find more of his work online :)
Ah well I'm sure your art is great too


Girls laughing at a sleepy puppy? They must really be demons disguised as girls
St Catherine’s Hospice charity event. Bark in the park.  this is Mango a french bull and pug.  she just finished her long walk, she was in and out of her pram. but don't want to hurt  her joints with to much walking. shes only 19 weeks
Your puppy is very cute! <3 

I'm sorry people laughed. 
The first thing I think anytime I see a dog (or any pet) being wheeled around in a pram or being out and about in any way other than on their own paws, is that the owner is a legend, putting their dog to the top of their list and making sure they still get to see the world even if they have out of the ordinary needs.
Ok I think you ought to put this photo in r/awww,  it is adorable. Just ignore the girls, sorry it happened to you. Just keep doing what you are doing for you.
Brush off their laughter - some people are just fortunate enough to not even have a point of reference when it comes to understanding mental illness and the struggles that people suffering from them go through every day. And I truly do feel that you won't understand the suffering until you experience it yourself.

Just remember that at the end of the day, you are taking care of yourself and putting your mental health first and that is all that matters! Keep being awesome and good luck in the future <3
She is precious. Absolutely adorable. Animals are pure love and magic, nothing keeps me going like my dog. 
Fuck those bitches! :) hahahaha, pram on.

100% good for you.  Rock on
no they started shouting woof! woof! like in a bullying way :(

i looked right at them, they stopped and i walked away. then they started (forced laughing) like really loud. like it was funny i looked at them being nasty. why cant people just leave each other alone. not hurting anyone.

The pink and orange one speaks to me. Look Great!

Beautiful! 
i love these!
I hope you are doing well.
Thank you! 
:D

In my experience the problem is often I'm too caught up in the sort of "can't", "impossible", "hopeless" language when in reality there are ways I can talk about what's going on even if it's to myself. Writing it out in my journal tends to help, and when I've itemized/quantified the primary worries or concerns on my mind it's a lot easier to find a person who I can talk to a specific issue about. They don't have to know the full picture of my madness, but people love to give advice and be helpful. Giving people that opportunity to help me, even if it's for just a fraction of my concerns, in a social context tends to be positive for everyone involved.
Playing Overwatch has helped me a lot, considering the characters often give very sound advice for changing your mindset to do better in the game and life (e.g. Anything Zenyatta ever says)

Also the teamwork 
Funny enough it's often the opposite for me. At least when I spend too much time playing it. Games give you that sense of progression and dopamine that people need, but it doesn't persist very long unless I'm eating well and getting enough cardio. I've found that video games can be a self-medicating treatment for depression, but like anything you can develop a tolerance for its effects. The only sustainable solution for me has been facing fears, doing meaningful work, exercising regularly, and eating healthy food.

Yep, after two years my psychiatrist inexplicably said just forget the past and move on and snap out of it.

I have early onset Alzheimer's and severe CPTSD and DID. I contacted nami, California board of ethics, other agencies without a single response. So pathetic!
[Snap out of it](https://youtu.be/H8tLS_NOWLs)!
Woah, this hit deep 
I thought of this song too! One of my favorites :)

I have been having physical health problems in recent years that gets so much kindness from relatives that never extended one iota for my mental/emotional suffering. It makes me sad and angry.

I DO NOT want pity.

I just found I appreciate a kind word, a sincere "how are you doing" where they look me in the eye even when I try to avoid it, maybe an offer of a hug or a compassionate pat on the shoulder with "I hope you feel better soon". It would be so nice if mental issues got that same treatment. Not a fuss, just a little compassion just as one would for another with someone with a migraine or their arthritis giving them a bad time. "That sucks, I hope you find something to help soon".

I never got that with my mental issues. It was ignored. No one made an effort to find out how I was really doing if I said fine. I used to be ok with that because I didn't feel my problems were worth bothering others over. Now I realize it was because in society in general and my extended family mental problems weren't worthy of compassion or an effort to understand it.


that is awesome! 
Thank you. Is it okay with your friend if I share this?
[deleted]
nope, their name begins with a C.

I personally like to turn to art when my mental illnesses are acting up. Making emotional connections to paintings sometimes makes me feel better. What do you all think? 
Please share more. I love this piece. 
That is stunningly beautiful!
This reminds me of holi - colorful and chaotic and overwhelming and beautiful! 
That's very nice. Relatable and calming.

I've been attempting to do the same, but I'm no visual artist. Kudos on this. 
Thank you for your feedback! If you'd like to read about this piece I wrote about it on my blog [here](http://www.pixelle.co/rikka-ayasaki/), and I will definitely share more art here with you all! :)
I think it's amazing. 
I'm so glad you're able to do that! And with the way this came out, let me just say that this is another example of why I'll be forever jealous of people who are artistically talented haha. I love it :)
Definitely will do, thanks for your input!
It's okay! I am not a visual artist myself either, but I really like to look at artworks whenever I have a chance (online or at museums) to calm myself down. Don't get down on yourself,  keep trying! :)

A while ago I had a fight with my mum and she kicked me out of the house for the night, it was pissing down rain and I was crying like crazy. A woman passing me on the street handed me her only umbrella that she was using and sat with me until I accepted it. I still have her umbrella and I haven't seen her since but I know I'll never forget what she did for me.
When I was a teenager I had a shitty therapist that forced me to tell my parents things I wasn't ready to disclose. I told her no and stormed out of her office crying. I sat on a bench outside sobbing. A woman and her daughter came up and the woman gave me a hug. The little girl asked why I was crying and the woman told her it doesn't matter. It was such an amazing thing. It was over ten years ago and I'll never forget that kindness. 

Damn.
I'm not understanding his interpretation of depression. Does anyone else know what he's conveying?
I think the person's stuck to the floor. That's what sadness/depression feel like to me. Like wading through a fast flowing river or treacle - even the simplest things are difficult. 

When I'm depressed I can't even motivate myself to lift a fork, let alone a weight.
I was a bike messenger for four years, exercised 40 hours a damn week and it didn't do anything to help my depression. Being in shape helped a little bit with my self-image but not very much.
Here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your school/work or is unavailable for any reason:

#***goggles do nothing***  

>***Post Title:***  *MRW my doctor tells me to exercise to help my depression* 

>***Top:***  *THE ENDORPHINS* 

>***Bottom:***  *DO NOTHING* 



[Original Link^1](http://imgur.com/fj834QN) | [Meme Template^2](http://imgur.com/memegen/create/fj834QN)
What endorphins?  I rarely get them.
I get so tired of people telling me I'll feel better if I exercise more.
Oh.

And I was about to start lifting to try to lift my mood :\
I guess I've never really tried to exercise while depressed. That being said I often feel a high after exercising past the point of almost giving up due to lactic acid pain.

It is definitely good for self image though. 
This is basically what I tell my therapist every time the topic of exercise is brought up. Like I want to get in shape and see if it helps my depression but I can barely get out of bed.
It might work for you, I find that exercise does improve my mood, but it's just hard to get motivated into doing it regularly
Definitely try it, it works for a lot of people, just not all, obviously. 
It helped me tons and still does. It was one of my break through things, and I'm a pretty happy person now.
Right? Getting dressed is as hard as running a marathon.

brilliant this pretty much nails my life.
I like this very much. I also love Hyperbole and a Half's depression comic.
Accurate. Those grey blobby bastards. 
Yeah. Now go learn some ACT (The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris) and learn how to beat those suckers...
i love this so much
This is spot on.

Is this real? I wanna facebook it but I don't want to facepalm my way back to reddit :P

If this is accurate, it's a very interesting rebuttal to claims from friends and family such as 'get over it'.

I vaguely remember someone who works in radiology of some sort saying these were fake but I don't remember when/where that was.

If it was this clear, all insurance companies would require this before prescribing meds or paying for therapy.

There are many studies that show evidence of mental illness in brain scans but IIRC, it's far from this pronounces and not everyone shows the same patterns and thus it is inconclusive at best.
Such a vital message.
Could someone point out the differences in the CT scan for PTSD?  I'm having a hard time distinguishing the two; it almost looks like they're two different "slices" of image. 
Hello, sorry I am unale to search proppperly at the moment and cant find the source of the pic but I do know that detecting mental illness by brain scans is in its first stages and is looking promising.

Here is Thomas Insel, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, doing a presentation at T.E.D which might help for now. Other peoples input and research from fellow redditors would be greatly appreciated.

http://ed.ted.com/lessons/toward-a-new-understanding-of-mental-illness-thomas-insel
I don't often comment, but thought after seeing this you would want to watch this youtube clip (it's Robert Sapolski from Stanford University), i recommend watching it all - i find it ridiculously informative. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc


His argument is that saying to somebody to get over it, if the same as saying to a diabetic, why are you still on insulin, surely you're over it now and should just get over that. 
I don't know this source or it's credibility, but the images used here are Positive Emission Tomography (PET) scans which are able to show blood flow, glucose metabolism, and oxygen use; essentially showing the areas in the brain that are active (or under or over active) in disease states. 

While these have  been helpful in understanding disease states, they are not really necessary for diagnosis because diagnosis and management are based on clinical symptoms. 
I would guess two reasons: Too expensive, and diagnosis is currently too heavily based on symptoms.
Psychologist-to-be, you don't understand insurance companies yet. 

They do not want to pay for an expensive diagnostic if there are cheaper non-experimental diagnostics available.
 
Also, I think it goes without saying that we're looking at one single brain scan here. 

If you still think this is fake, take it up with [Dr. Joseph Goldberg, MD](http://www.webmd.com/depression/ss/slideshow-depression-overview).

Finally, an important note: Don't take advice from someone that is outside of the realm of that person's specialty. Would you ask your plumber to tell you if he thinks you have eczema?
Thank you for posting this. You're right about it being informative. I'm trying to help my son's friend be proactive about the treatment she's getting for her depression.  This will help us formulate some questions about her current treatment and options her doctor may not know about. His current plan is to keep throwing pills at it.

Couldn't agree more.
We all need to know more so we can address this correctly.
Whilst it does need careful planning and implementation, to suggest education on mental HEALTH does not have a place in schools is incredibly narrow minded and frankly, a little scary. This is exactly why many grow up not being able to reach out and ask for help, or worse, not understand their thoughts & feelings and end up turning to self harm, self destructive behaviours, isolation, and more.

Sorry about the lack of ownership.

Last winter I made it a habit to go feed a group of young ravens in the park. They got me out daily and it was nice to have them gathering around me. I even learned to identify some of them because of their personality.
[Dipstick and Houdini](http://i.imgur.com/oPTV5qc.jpg) have been lifesavers when it comes to my mental health. 

Houdini has been in my life since I was about 17, so almost 10 years now. She was a fragile, frail little kitten with ringworm, and she gave me purpose in a bad time in my life. It didn't matter how bad of a panic attack I was having, or how hard it was to get out of bed; I had to get up and give her medicine to make the ringworm go away. She stayed in the bathroom for quarantine from the other animals and just meowed and cried for weeks, so most of the time I would just go sit in there with her. As soon as the bathroom door opened, her whiny, crying meows turned into happy mewls and a purr so loud you'd think a diesel engine was starting up outside. I was alone in the world, but *someone* was happy to see me. Today, she meets me at the bottom of my stairs when I come home from work and lays on the arm of the couch above my head. Always purring away. 

Dipstick is fairly new addition to the family, I've only had her for three years now. Whereas Houdini is not a lap/bed/cuddle cat, Dipstick is almost annoyingly so. Her intuition for when momma isn't feeling good is uncanny, and if I'm curled up in bed trying to calm the panic, you can damn near guarantee she's wormed her way into my fetal position and is pressed against my chest, staring at me and purring. When I'm down with a cold or the flu, she can always be found on my chest or stomach, occasionally reaching a paw up to brush my face as if to say "I'm making it all better right mom?" Yes, Dipstick. Yes you are. 
Too often there is threads that are posted everyday saying how awful we feel. I figured I would make a happy thread where we can share stories about our animals and how they have helped us! This is my cat Manhattan and she is my best friend. [= She is the reason I keep going everyday.

I just got my cat out of a 20ft tree last rainy night.


 With a ladder and a bucket.

Ive never been more happy, just being on the ground then now.
[This is my Remy](http://i.imgur.com/QjlTo52.jpg) She is 2 years old. She is the light of my life, derp and all.
I found my lil Bean just as my anxiety was getting really bad. It's safe to say she chose me because she knew how much I needed her :) She helps me fall asleep at night and keeps me from being lonely during the day and I love her so much.  http://i.imgur.com/pKy5SYg.jpg http://i.imgur.com/f6xMd1P.jpg 
 I'd be dead right now if it weren't for my wonderful pug. I have so come so close to suicide several times, But I can't stand the thought of him starving to death because no one will notice that I'm missing. I can't stand the thought of him being found and sent to the pound. I can't stand the thought of him living with somebody else and being confused and not understanding what happened. He's so smart, we have an almost psychic bond, if I left him it would just be the most horrible horrible thing. And whenever I cry he comes from wherever he is, even if he was sound asleep, and he sits on my foot and looks up at me with those huge soupy brown eyes and sometimes he puts his paw on my leg. He is literally a lifesaver.

Edit: And it scares the shit out of me that he is getting old. :(

My lady Robin came into my life a month after losing her front leg and having some very major surgery.  I'd not long lost my job and was trying to get to grips with my resurgent depression, new PTSD, anxiety and some agoraphobia.  We've been together for 7 years, through marriage break ups, multiple house moves, a diagnosis of BPD (me, not her) and plenty more ups and downs.  She's the most affectionate, beautiful, vocal and adorable creature I've ever known.  I helped her recover physically and she keeps helping my mental recovery.  I'd be dead without her.  
So many beautiful posts [=

Well being in nature alone removes you from the various stimuli in the environment that triggers outbursts or other mental events. The stress of daily life is absent. In that sense being in nature is a kind of recovery environment, though not a cure in itself, being less stressed allows tge brain to mend itself from the damage caused by mental health issues. 
http://www.psypost.org/2016/06/long-visits-nature-linked-improved-mental-health-study-finds-43491
YES! Whenever I'm stressed, I walk to a lake or go hiking to get some peace of mind. Water ALWAYS calms me.
I had the opposite reaction once nearly having a breakdown in the wilderness alone. I find night time is the most relaxing at home. There's less stimuli from light and stuff yet you still have modern conveniences available
For me, not really. I've been diagnosed Bipolar, ADD, and Depression. Being alone in nature makes me feel bored, useless, sometimes irritated, and makes me think about my depressions, dwelling on things, and makes me more depressed. The only time my mental health has ever improved is when i spend time with friends.

I feel far less irritated, far less bored, and quite a bit more useful when i'm in my room, with my computer in front of me, attempting to do anything that i can concentrate on, even if it goes unfinished. I have a number of illustrations that are unfinished because i lose concentration and the will to work on them part way through. But i occasionally come back and do a bit at a time once in a while. I have Quite a number of projects, finished in my head, i can see them, but once i sit and try to write them or start them in illustrator or building the 3d model in blender, i end up not being able to complete them.
I would love to connect with you via PM if you were open to it?
Wait so being outside away from people and pollution is good for you?? Who knew!
Yeah I completely agree! I find my regular life way too stimulating and stressful as it is now. That's why my boyfriend and I are going to drive around Australia and live out of a van, I hope it can finally bring peace. 
Nice!
I'm so different, in that night time is when I'm so emotionally volatile!
That makes sense, that you get pleasure from being busy and feeling like you have a purpose. I'm glad that you can find peace in that way
Sure
Lmao
I just saw the opposite of "health massively improving" today:

Van Gogh is known mostly for his vibrant impressionist landscapes and portraits, and much less attention is paid to his still life pieces. In 1890, close to the end of his lifetime, he created Almond Blossom as a special gift for his brother’s newborn son. Blue is heralded as a grounding, calming color, and almond trees flower early in the Spring, making this painting a symbol of rebirth, new life, and hope, all subjects upon which Van Gogh often pondered. It is obvious that he put much thought and soul into this piece for his nephew, for not only was this painting meant to be a meaningful gift, its creation was likely quite beneficial for Van Gogh as well. He spent his entire adult life struggling to manage his imbalanced mental health, so for him to be able to imagine this immortal moment of peace and tranquility was a huge accomplishment in his life. I wrote more about this piece on my blog [here](http://www.pixelle.co/vincent-van-gogh/) would love some feedback :)

It isn't surprising. I feel this might have been around since long. Wonder the trend will change.
Yeah cause they're depressed. This is like saying people with the most broken legs are the least likely to run to the emergency room
Don't assume help is available.  All the "help" I've seen is either unavailable, unhelpful, incompetent, or abusive.  There is more to be gained from the average youtube video than any "professional" you might encounter.  And I've seen *many* "professionals"!

I didnt have the exact same challenges he did but I could have written something like this myself.

"You only cry for help if you believe there is help to cry for" is such a profound statement. Punched me right in the heart.
Somewhere out there a five year old is undergoing way too much, and I can't help them. They don't know anything abnormal is happening. They may hug a tree for help. I can't help them. They will grow to be very exploitable, they may be very weak. I wish I could help them, especially people who don't have the usual trauma. It is so easy to disappear unusual trauma.

Edit: one especially vulnerable "group" really is people like beautiful Wentworth, specifically what I call straight homosexuals. At times more isolated than virtually anyone. Also some become rather dangerous in their not having any category.

Yeah she's famous, talented, beautiful, and has some money, but similarly and even more famous, talented, beautiful, and wealthy individuals haven't been successful at coping with mental illness.

Also yeah she mentioned her game as something she created in someway to give people a positive distraction or way to cope. I find myself creating artwork and other things for the same reason and would mention it in an interview as well.

Most importantly, she's freaking 24 years old. Give her a little slack for not having everything fully polished and figured out.

She's a person with a mental illness doing what she can to cope and contributing what she can to destigmatize and help others. So get out of here with your petty negativity.
How much negativity in here! Personally, I like it when celebrities are open about their mental health struggles. There's enough stigma around mental illnesses, and a well known person speaking up about it can really help fighting it. Mental health is still too much of a taboo, the more we talk about it, spreading correct informations and demolishing false myths, the closer we get to remove the stigma. 

It also shows how everyone can suffer from them. Even if you have beauty, money, fans... you still can have crippling depression. Mental illnesses don't care who you are. I thought this was already obvious to people suffering from them... apparently it's not.

Furthermore, celebrities can have a huge impact on their fans, especially the younger ones who might feel less alone in their struggles if they know that their favourite singer/actor/sportsman is going through it too. So, thumbs up to this woman for speaking about her conditions, and good luck to her and everyone who's fighting her same battle against a mental illness. 
Lol she hawked her own game as something to help people cope.  Christ.  Also, i wish i could afford a 'treatment team'. 
For whatever I may not like about them, I will always respect a celebrity for being candid about mental illness. They get to the top of the mountain & then reveal something that could cause all of Hollywood to kick them off. They can lose what they have in the blink of an eye for something they can't control. Those who say "you know what? I'm gonna talk about it. I'm not gonna hide this" have my respect & gratitude. Not to mention that the work that they do to break the stigma. The stigma is real & it's infuriating & unacceptable. 
I'm Living Proof of Living Well *


&nbsp;

*as long as I'm attractive and talented.
She seems very inauthentic. 
>even more famous, talented, beautiful, and wealthy individuals haven't been successful at coping with mental illness.

Citation/numbers needed else that statement reeks of optimism bias, exaggeration and/or cherry picking.


&nbsp;

>So get out of here with your petty negativity.

Negative? Sure. Petty? Guess that's your problem. Just trying to even things out. Rampant optimism isn’t good either.  

It would be dishonest to ignore/not mention that one's chances are better if you're famous, talented, attractive, and have capital. Or that there is “always” a way/solution. 

Kudos to her for actually doing something especially since she's in a position to affect more people. My beef with her message (and those like it) is…well, it’s rather convoluted and long. Let’s just say we have incompatible philosophies.  Being that people such as yourself think life is great (which is probably an objective truth to people like you), you probably wouldn’t care to read my thoughts anyway. 

You're the boss. It's tough to see that kind of negativity. Because yes, when we have mental illnesses, it can really skew our reality and make everything seem pretty dark. 

But, when you read an article like this and say things like, "well, she's just attractive, rich, lucky, etc." that's not your chemical imbalance. That's your personality and outlook.
Its not optimisim bias, shes barely an A-List celebrity and she was barely a B-List celebrity before all this went down. Hollywood is littered with A-List celebrities that haven't recovered as well.

You don't know the first thing about me. I've had a solid 6 months straight of daily suicidal thoughts and 1 attempt. I struggle to find the positivity in life on a daily basis, but even I can muster enough positivity to wish someone the best if they're trying to do something good for themselves and others. Just because it doesn't fit with your outlook or what you would do and just because you think they have it easier doesn't mean it is wrong.
>Hollywood is littered with A-List celebrities that haven't recovered as well.

Yes, very much so. I forgot what my original "beef" (for the lack of a better word)/justification for scrutinizing your point was. Conceded. 


&nbsp;

Though best not to assume, too many people cherish life/living to an obsessive extreme IMO and, this being reddit, I thought it statistically more likely my assumption of you was correct than false. My apologies.



&nbsp;


>Just because it doesn't fit with your outlook or what you would do and just because you think they have it easier doesn't mean it is wrong.

I see. Then, to clarify: I may think the methodology is done "wrong" (only some parts) but I don't think she or anyone else who does it *is* wrong.

My (and those that agreed with) petty negativity was simply doing what I said previously: evening it out. 

In retrospect, that probably did more harm than good. I suppose my only goal/intention was to bring awareness to that so people don't get *as* disappointed if, after hearing such inspiration, their efforts failed. Which probably doesn't matter as alleviating a little of the disappointment is a teardrop against the sea/ocean of the whole thing.

So I come across as an insufferable cynical asshole (guilty; though I'm not usually this insufferable). 



&nbsp;

Again, apologies. We have more common than first thought and I guess my jadedness (not boasting but I struggled with the same. Though duration wise it has been more than twice that) seeped through. 

No worries, on any given day I would have the same reaction you did to this story and I totally see your point.
I accidentally set mine too high and I didn't think the game was going to be this hard.
I find if you grind a little each day in the healthy habit skillset, you can build your character up to having the "routine" buff. 

You do have to grind each day to keep up your progress for these dailies, but eventually it just turns into an automatic action that you don't really have to put much effort into. 

Try out the following:

* exercise - builds STR and is a boost to mood attribute
* meditate
* journaling
* setting daily shut down and booting times to reap maximum energy for the following day
* check your character's stats often - i.e., if they are hungry, feed them; if they are dirty, bathe them; if their environment is poor, have them clean up; if they are tired, set to shut down 15min-1hr if it's day mode in game or several hours (6-8) in night mode

I'd say start a little at first since your game is set to hard - like 10 minutes daily if that's doable, then you can add in more time as you progress and get streak achievements. You'll have to keep it up since it's hard mode, but at least it  makes the game feel a little easier. 

Best of luck!
/r/outside
What a brilliant way to look at things, needed this.
There's a co-op mode where you can play with help from other people but the game difficulty stays the same. Takes some figuring out but worth it.
It doesn't get easier. You get better.
Just go into settings. Set it to easy.
/r/fifthworldproblems? 
I joined a 2-person guild 13 years ago, we disbanded earlier this year... but I realized she was actually working against me and making the game harder for most of the time we were together. Now it's easier, but I have no reason to play, no one to share my successes in the game with or to help me get over my failures... so I'm stuck doing the same dungeon every day, paralyzed with both fear and apathy to try the next hardest one, and I'm starting to lose motivation to even do the level I'm on each day.
But you get better by dieing and starting over with more experience living.  Going at it again with your previous knowledge.
Sounds like you might need to mess around in arcade mode for a while and take a break from trying to level nonstop.
No... Don't die please
Hire some escorts and use recreational drugs, got it!

Looks like the episide must have been bad rather than the painting which is interesting.

are the somatic symptoms related to specific ptsd memories and that's how you know they're caused psychologically? Or do you trust the doctors when they say you have somataform disorder? (I am wary of somataform diagnosis personally despite speculation into it by my psychiatrist)
They help by keeping me in the moment and grounded.They wont cure your symptoms, but they will definitely help you fight them.
I've had numerous tests and have spent a great deal of money in hospitals and with specialists, the pain is definitely is not real, and by not real, I mean the only cause is my brain. It is still hard to believe at times when I am in agony, but I now know its true.


Ya but we aren't plates. We have consciousness and with it, the tools to move on. That's what I have learned atleast, not easily I might add.
Yayay, I love it.  A vast majority of the time I hate "sorry"s.

I usually respond to it like "if you're really sorry, don't do it again" to forgive.  

Sometimes people are really genuinely sorry, like honest-mistake-deeply-sorry sorry.  I love when people apologize for stuff like that.

Usually, though, it's an I-benefitted-from-the-situation-in-some-respect-and-just-want-to-feel-better-about-the-damage-I-did-to-you sorry.  
So accurate. I wish more people would understand that sorry does not magically erase the pain that words cause. 
You can move on but that doesn't mean it doesn't leave a mark, that it doesn't change you forever. Everything that happens to you, every relationship, everything said to you, changes you. Whether for good or for bad or lateral is another topic. 
Appropriately grieve, and move on the best advice I've gotten on the subject. There is a correlation between quality of life and the number of grudges a person keeps, I believe so anyway.
The mark I let it leave when appropriate is "this person is an asshole".  I wouldn't say I hold grudges, but if the person doesn't like being told why what they did was a dick move, I just try to avoid them.  Not really an emotional thing as much as an intellectual "being in this person's vicinity is not a good idea" thing.
I agree with that perspective, but unless you're a robot odds are your emotions may lead you towards doing counter-intelligent things at one point or another, and there's not anything hugely wrong with that. Human condition etc.

Ya so as someone with PTSD, I don't say the word 'triggered' because of all the asshats that over use the word. Like that college  student who saw a statue of a man in his underwear and claimed that it 'triggered' and 'traumatized' her. The meme is making fun of people who feel like the whole world should censor itself for their benefit. These people  claiming to have PTSD from a mean comment on the internet, who take up the spot light from rape and abuse victims.

And anyways, there's other ways for people who really need to express themselves to do so without using the word 'triggered'. Even just using the word in the proper context saves you from being mocked. 

I would say "yesterday I was on the subway, a large man near me started yelling and it triggered a panic attack". Or "that movie had a realistic rape scene that really provoked me" or "made me panic" or "gave me anxiety".

The word triggered was given a negative connotation long before the 'meme'.
I rarely see this used to mock genuinely ill people. Most often I see it thrown at self-diagnosed tumblr users who are "triggered" by someone making an argument they disagree with. Obviously if someone is genuinely ill then they shouldn't be made fun of for that illness. But this whole trigger warning thing seems a bit counter-productive to me. Isn't part of recovery about being able to confront those things which prevent you from leading a full and happy existence? In my eyes a domestic violence victim being able to openly confront their past with resilience is the goal. Not to shield them from it and pretend it never happened and never will to anyone ever again.

Obviously ill people are going to have certain triggers but it's unrealistic to think that everyone should both know and accommodate those triggers. The most important thing is knowing your own triggers and learning how to cope with them. I'm sorry if that sounds callous. I hope it doesn't, because certain things set off certain triggers in me. However, I don't expect others to censor perfectly harmless discussion for my benefit; I expect myself to recover and be well again.
I'm not at all offended by the term triggered being used in this context. It's lost more meaning by being used inappropriately and over zealously by people only trying to play the victim in university/ internet debates. 
I avoid using the word because of the idiots who bastardised it not the people making fun of said idiots. I find it nice that people call those self-diagnosed attention seekers out, I think the triggered meme is funny. In fact I find a lot of mental health jokes funny because I relate to them rather than making myself an uptight victim. I think with real mental health issues comes a warped sense of humour, just ask any nurse or carer. 
I only see this meme used to make fun of people who refuse to see the difference between being offended and having a previous memory of trauma "triggered" by outside stimuli.

Mattresses without sheets **are** a trigger for me but i don't walk into a Serta store and start screaming it's the stores fault.

I thought it made fun of those things.
This post triggered me. 
I am very scared of bugs/spiders and I've had panic attacks from being around them (my first panic attack happened because a cockroach fell on me when i was in the shower #dormlife). The other day there was a huge spider in my lab and I basically started freaking out, so I began to do my breathing exercises and as I was excusing myself to leave the room someone "jokingly" said, "what are you triggered or something?" And they laughed at me while I tried to prevent a full on panic attack during my class. It's not funny and it's exhausting and I wish I wasn't like this. This meme is really shitty and people should stop making fun of mentally ill people.
Not all people can or will recover, is the problem. Even the best therapy can fail to help the average person with PTSD when it comes to things like this. Rather than expecting "everyone they meet" to know about these, as much as "everybody they meet and tell". Is it so hard to not joke about/discuss, say, rape, around these people? 

By my experience the people who say they respect victims of mental trauma and want to show that respect, but won't listen to how that person wants to be shown respect (avoiding their triggers) really don't want to respect them at all. They want to invalidate the person's model of respect. 
Boom, slap shot in the goal!
Well that person is an arsehole. As I say, I won't defend that.
In my experience, recovery rates for PTSD appear to be one of the better groups. Still, ok, sometimes people don't recover. Those who personally know individuals who have disclosed issues relating to PTSD are invariably quite sensitive. Moreover, those who aren't are not the group being discussed by OP. He/she is disputing the idea that saying "lol, triggered" in general is ok.

Well, that I take issue with. As individuals we have a duty to respect the feelings and wishes of those around us, agreed. If my friend was a victim of rape I would avoid rape jokes (unless directed otherwise). Point being: I follow direction from individuals. The issue is when you encounter a large group of people with various triggers and various degrees of mental illness (particularly when some members of that group have no diagnosis at all). When facing such a group you cannot individually ascertain and cater to all triggers, not in areas of free public speech. Even if we wanted to and could do that, should we? The primary treatments for anxiety-based disorders all involve exposure-based therapy (i.e. approach that which makes you anxious). Over time the anxiety *will* go away. How soon and to what extent varies but shielding individuals from their anxiety reinforces the anxiety. It suggests that their fear is accurate and protective. To be diagnosed with a mental health issue then, bluntly put, your fear is extreme (i.e. is inaccurate) and limits your ability to function (i.e. not protective).

To answer your question, no it's not hard to avoid discussion of rape around one friend you know has been raped. In that situation I probably would avoid it, as they're my friend not my patient. If they were my patient it'd pretty much be my job to help them face that part of ther past. Regardless, that is not what we are discussing. We're discussing the control of language in public contexts. Unfortunately I cannot reliably control my speech so that it will not set off any trauma-based triggers. Seemingly innocuous words like mustard, male, safety, brother, child and vase can trigger memories for people. It's unreasonable to expect accommodation in public settings. Further, I am not going to control my language to mitigate even obviously emotional words like threaten, violence, destruction, rape or battery because I believe it limits our ability to discuss these issues effectively. I won't restrict my jokes because humour can often be an effective coping mechanism, particularly for trauma. I say all of this as a trauma victim and a psychologist. We gain strength and resilience from facing these issues. It is absolutely unpleasant, I agree and know better than I would like. But it is necessary.

Further still and finally: the issue is whether throwing around "lol, triggered" is ok. Well, it's an insult... So no, it's not ok to insult others. But if your aim is to insult someone who is being ridiculous, then it serves its purpose very well. If your aim is to insult someone who is a genuine trauma victim and PTSD sufferer, then you're an asshole. Being an asshole is not a crime, nor should it be. I wish people, particularly the extreme left, would stop making Orwellian attempts to control language. I'm a lefty myself but covering people in bubble-wrap is not conducive to resilience or recovery. Be respectful where possible, that is the only rule.
The problem is, you're not going to know if someone has a mental illness or not most of the time. So if everyone goes around saying "lol triggered!!", sure it might seem funny to the person and their mentally healthy friends, but they could also be being "that arsehole" as described in the above scenario. 

What do you expect, someone to stop you and say "Excuse me, I actually do have a mental illness and can't currently appropriately deal with these triggers, I'm working on it, please don't mock me for that", to which they undoubtedly respond "Oh, so sorry! The only reason I made fun of you was because I assumed you were nuerotypical, won't happen again"

I would say that when we find it okay to insult a person because we infer a belief they have from some other signal, we're in shifty territory for ethics. Is it ever right to insult people? Even if they're bad people? 

I only take up the point because it's very easy to go from making fun of straw feminists to making fun of real people, and this path - of indescriminately applying 'exposure therapy', as misunderstood by the general populace who is tired of PC, is a great way to alienate anyone different from our culture. 

Of course we can't presume to be responsive to every trigger and pronoun in a theoretical room full of them. In that case it's about treating them like real humans: either they understand a presenter can only discuss what they've planned, or a discussion can only be about the topic at hand and not their problems (the usual case), or the audience will be too unruly and immature for any constructive discussion anyway. It's a problem that solves itself when approached well.
I really appreciate this particular input in this thread. Very intelligent explanation.
Of course not. That's why it's important to use judgement. 
I specifically said that it's not ok to insult people. I would never advocate doing that because it's not productive. I'm not going to take up the position that it's morally right and nor did I say anything to that effect in previous posts. However, people do insult others all the time. I don't think we're going to fix that issue in this discussion. I just don't see how saying "lol, triggered" is more monstrous than calling someone a wankstain.

I'm not saying everyone should indiscriminately try to replicate something only qualified professionals can do... I'm saying, as a trauma victim myself to other trauma victims, shielding ourselves from language which hurts our feelings will not necessarily help. There's lots of evidence to suggest it makes things worse. It's a very slippery slope, everyone should use their judgement and, as I say, be respectful where possible. But as someone who has and does still suffer because of what others have done to me in the past... Tell your rape jokes, tell your DV jokes, tell your jokes about emotional abuse. If I can laugh at them then that means I'm strong and I'm healing, I'm finding joy again. Face your fears instead of hiding from them. Don't expect others to become miserable robots, frightened of saying the wrong thing in case it upsets someone. Being upset is a part of life. Let it happen, it's not going to kill you.
I think we agree. I'm just uncomfortable with how the precipice of not hurting people balances between 'people who really really want to say hurtful/mean things' and 'oppressive control over the medium of conversation'. I wish it were a bigger space of acceptable discourse, but as long as there are people who will end discussion over unintended insults and people who will end discussion over not being allowed to be insulting, then I guess we're stuck here.

I think for most people it is quite a large area. That's why I take issue with the blanket statement that saying "lol, triggered" isn't ok. I've only seen it used with sensitivity, actually criticising people who fabricate mental illness for social inclusion. I never see anyone use it at a genuinely distressed, mentally ill person. I also wouldn't defend that.

Realistically I think most people can judge when a joke is or isn't ok for themselves and, when they can't, others can address it tactfully. Some are more blunt than others and some more sensitive than others. That's both normal and ok. My point really is that these over-arching rules about how to speak are generally pretty meaningless and unhelpful. People are very resilient when you give them a chance. I think we should worry a bit less about what others say and do (as long as they aren't being actively horrible) and worry a bit more about making sure we're ok.

I get that feeling. Best friend just told me to stop being so negative. 

*sigh*
"You just need to get some fresh air!"
Its so real its actually funny
At least there are people responding to your status, I'm jealous lol
Truth
I had a friend who had to make that very clear to me face to face. It's natural to take it personally. I do that a lot too. I also live alone and will do so for the foreseeable future.
Yeah, I can only agree. I keep fantasizing about running away from everyone and just live by myself somewhere. Managing my shitty mental health was like a full time job BEFORE I also had to deal with other people's bullshit. I'm not sure it's worth it.
I got rid of my social media for this reason. It's hard enough having to deal with people day to day as it is lol. 
Just be glad you're not overweight too. then you get double the discrimination.
Well, does your friend know you have a mental health problem? Because if not mental health problems really easily get mistaken for being lazy or negative by other people..
The first comment is my mom, and that is very out of character for her. Usually it's "Nothing like talking to mom to make you feel better. Call me!" Or "You don't have any time to text me?"
Yeah I feel this. 
Moving across the country and creating a new support system helps. None of the people who commented (aside from my mom) are people I knew from birth to about 2 years ago. Soft resetting my life helped a lot.
That's what I did. I moved 1000 miles away and started working somewhere new and made new friends. That's all it took for me.
Yeah, they know all about it. I used to go to them to talk about it whenever I needed to
That's good! I moved to a different country, but I ended up just stuck in a new place with new people who also don't get it, and at least one of them is an objectively awful individual. It's still probably technically a better situation than I was in before, but still, not great. And not really able to run off again at the moment.

At least that means I'll probably die sooner.
Great. One more thing to worry about.
I heard a theory once on a ted talk suggesting that stress is not actually bad for you if you don't believe it is. (I'm gonna loop it back, don't worry) They said that people who believe stress to be bad for their health experience the negative health effects while those who do not or who look at it as a good thing experience no negative effects. I'm wondering if the same could be true with depression. Not to say that it wouldn't still be an awful thing to experience but that it could possibly have little to know health effects. If the first theory is even true. 
Another "mental health awareness" post which will result in more drugs prescription. But no one ever suggests alternative medical treatments, like hormonal replacement therapy, which have potential to work better than drugs for anyone regardless of if they have any endocrine system issues.

But hormones are non-patentable because they are bioidentical, and there is no money in that, so what happens instead is that people are given some shitty SSRI instead of testosterone/estrogen replacement which has high chance of helping anyone with "depression" regardless of their current levels, really (unless there is another underlying medical illness, of course).

Usual story ends with that SSRI dropping testosterone and estrogen, and whatever the issue was it just got worse, because when they are low, those hormones alone can cause so called "depression". SSRI side-effects and withdrawal add to the mix. 

In the end, someone sold some shitty drug, person who had a problem is no better, but more articles like this get published because that drug earned some very sweet money. Only point of this article is to make people think that they need to go get checked for "depression", and only "depression", nothing else, boo.

>“There’s a growing recognition for the need to screen and treat depression, and that doing so can reduce the risk of negative cardiovascular outcomes,” she says. “This study adds to the research by looking at specific mood symptoms, so I think it’s a great addition to what we already know.”
LoL!, I came here to say "Geez another thing to be depressed about".
That's the same shit every non-depressive person says, "it's all about attitude". 
You're talking about something very specific like its the cure for cancer. Depression will not and can not be cured or medicated in only one way. 

If this is something that helps then it needs adding to our toolset. Not replacing it. 
Hormones are patented and sold as well. If they worked then we'd be pushing them. Depending on the hormone there are a lot of potential risks which are worse than the risks of SSRIs. 

Also there have been studies looking at the utility of screening for hormonal imbalance in depression and they haven't shown any value to it - namely because if someone is experiencing something like Addison's disease then they will show other concerning signs. That said many doctors at least screen for thyroid levels though again anyone with hypothyroidism will be showing other signs as well. 

That all being said I agree that the approach should include a life-encompassing assessment that includes someone's day to day activities, their stressors, their exercise and hobbies and diet, sleep hygiene, and any substance use or abuse, all of which are important targets. 
No, you've got it wrong. It won't change the actually depression. Just your bodies physical response to it. 
In fact I was pretty clear about that in my comment and I don't appreciate your bitchy comment and assumptions. 
I'm quite convinced that there indeed is something very specific. It has potential to help fast, safely when done properly, will work  for majority of people with "depression", and when it works there is no doubt that it did. I'm talking about radical changes, not some marginal HARDS score improvement on the border of statistical significance.

I'll even add that I now think that sex hormones are as close to the root cause as it gets due to profound impact they exert on behavioral regulation, so it makes sense. I'm doing some work on putting everything I know about hormonal replacement therapy together, you can check a draft about estrogen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/hrtformentalhealth/wiki/estrogen


Bioidentical hormones are NOT patentable. HRT for mood issue can work regardless of endocrine status, so screening is not that relevant, it's approach that matters. Risks of HRT done correctly are much lower than that of antidepressants. 

Funny how people are afraid of hormonal replacement (endocrine system! boo, scary!), but at the same time not afraid to put a substance in their body that messes directly with the brian and was shown to be able to cause brain damage.
The only one being bitchy here is you. 
I'm just a bit busy at the moment but I appreciate your effort. Later on I'll have a bit of time and I'll come back to look at everything you've said. It clearly warrants more than a passing look. 
Rarely do we ever prescribe / have access to actual bio-equivalents in the sense you're speaking of. At least in my country. In either case some company will have their market share for a given hormone i.e. Synthroid with ABBV. 

Further, the practitioner, the researcher, the local health authority, etc. do not make more money if more people are on SSRI vs. HGH. They're only concerned with outcomes and not getting sued.  

In line with that there are two elements of risk. First is that you're supplementing a hormone that is *not* in deficit. Again we screen for some when indicated but if there is no clinical sign of hormonal disorder then its irresponsible to treat for it. Second is that we have a very good idea of the tangible risks because we have big studies on both HRT and SSRI. 
It's not doctors who have real money to decide what gets pushed more via advertising/campaigns.

I'm well familiar with supplementing hormones which are not in deficit, that's much more safe that is usually thought. Anabolic steroids were demonized so people are usually afraid due to what they hear, but sport medicine targeted at improving performance does exactly this for a long time now and begs to differ. Don't confuse fear mongering with real dangers.

Also funny you say about supplementing hormone which is not in deficit. You know serotonin is not in deficit either when you use an SSRI?
> Also funny you say about supplementing hormone which is not in deficit. You know serotonin is not in deficit either when you use an SSRI?

True though the resulting antidepressant effect is reliable. Regardless of the mechanism the studies show a similar response rate which can be stratified by severity of symptoms and further in some cases by genotype. 

For what its worth if you're thinking of any specific studies that have looked at this sort of 'non-supplementary' (for lack of a better word?) prescription of hormones I'd happily check em out and consider them. 
There are several meta-analyses which cast serious doubt on if SSRI work at all. I wouldn't call that reliable. 

I'm in process of putting information I have together, you can check my draft about estrogen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/hrtformentalhealth/wiki/estrogen

Also there is sport medicine which is about using hormones for performance increase in healthy people, you can look there as well.
The largest ones I've read have shown relative low NNT, particularly if you look at the other data stratified by severity and genotype. That said I'll look into this hormone theory further if you could link me some data. I won't have time for a proper lit search myself until next weekend. 
In my draft I linked above at the bottom there are large number of relevant studies cited.

I fucking hate this shit. Imaging making one of those for heart medicator or chemotherapy drugs. What the hell is wrong with people!?

This may sound overly dramatic, but I am probably still alive thanks to my medication.
I would've been hanging from one of those trees a long time ago without my meds, so yeah, great for all you who have a chemically balanced brain that lets you make uneducated statements
I'm more of an indoor kid. I can't defend myself, I've been declawed!
What the fuck. "Go outside and your cancer will stop!"
why are people THE WORST
Also more time consuming, exhausting and not everyone has a park or forest near them. Plus what about winter time and rain and heat? Shit I can barely get out of bed abd you want me to go find a damn forest? 
I'm no image editor but here it is without the bullshit

https://imgur.com/cxT44ZV
fuck those people
People don't understand depression, and this kind of thing doesn't help us. There are certainly times that I'm convinced it's all in my head and that if I were a better person or thought more positively, I wouldn't be so miserable. 

I recently switched my medication, and within a week, I was amazed by how much "less sad" I felt. Nothing has changed in my life, but I'm not crying or constantly reading self-help books trying to figure out a way to fix myself. I'm relaxed and feeling like I can enjoy the world around me again. People with chemical or hormonal issues can indeed be helped by a pill. 
I am with everyone who is pissed off about this. 
I have chronic depression among other mental disorders. So what you mean is if I take a walk in the woods the abnormalities in my brain will suddenly go away? My brain chemistry will magically be as naturally balanced as it should be? 
People who believe that mental illness is made up or full of shit have not had a family member whom needed  to be repeatedly admitted to mental hospitals, treatment facilities, and damn near anything else that would help.  A member of your family who is intelligent, beautiful, mature, and a very kind person turn into a violent, suicidal, numb, unpredictable person. It is not a fucking walk in the woods that fixes things like that! On this same note a schizophrenic should be able to go for a walk in the woods and be okay? Whoever made this is a stupid fuck that has only experienced a small amount of life and has not seen what a mental illness/disorder REALLY is. It is not "feeling bad". It is not "being sad all the time". It is not "being moody". If people would just shut the fuck up about it and research it, watch a documentary, ANY EFFORT AT ALL they would find that THE HUMAN BRAIN OF A PERSON WITH DEPRESSION HAS ABNORMALITIES, THE CHEMISTRY IS ABNORMAL. This applies specifically to people with CHRONIC depression. NOT SITUAIONAL(temporary). 
If anyone read this, thank you. Please try to understand mental health before you go and tell people to "suck it up". Brushing off someone with a serious mental illness for "feeling bad" and telling them to "suck it up" could be the end of that persons life. If you have ever lost someone to suicide you know what I am talking about. The sad part is, it's always the good ones who go.
You're shaming people that take medicine. Great job. Maybe you should keep making "progress" on Facebook.
fuck sake why aren't doctors prescribing trees to everyone then? the NHS are missing a trick /s 
Unless that forest is filled with shrooms and weed, the only use it would have for me is a nice isolated place to hide my body in.


When I first say this I'm like god what kind of shit comments are going to be on this. And then I started reading them and there are people out there who have a brain! 
It's an over generalization sure but a lot of doctors do prescribed dangerous medication to people who don't need it. Still stupid 
As someone who hates the medications I've taken, I also can step back and realize they brought me back from a situation I could never have recovered from otherwise.

I can understand the anger towards meds and the promotion of returning to nature/healthy living that is independent from drugs. Mental health is complex and drugs aren't perfect. But that text image is garbage when you actually think about how many people have been given chances they wouldn't have without meds. 

It is not black/white. At all. 
No
Nope.
I assume the title of your post is sarcastic? 
Maybe if I could actually get out of bed. And then actually drive to beautiful nature I would stop feeling so shitty all the time. I'll try it. Asshat!
Fuck. This.
reading some of these comments I can just say one thing: I'm glad there are a good handful of us who realize that that picture is complete fucking bullshit. and the ones who truly do suffer from mental illness can recognize this type of bullshit as we come across it on the Internet, which is also filled with a very good amount of bullshit. thank you guys, for reminding me that there are people out there who do understand and also  who don't feel the need to look down on myself or anyone else who takes medication. thank you. it's comforting to say the least. and to the person who mentioned something along the lines of "if it weren't for my meds I'd be hanging from those trees years ago" i can one hundred percent relate and seeing that helped put things into perspective, big time. accepting the fact that I will need meds the rest of my life is something I'm still dealing with but over time it does become easier, I can tell you that much for sure. 
God i hate my antidepressants. 
If I'd never taken medication my anorexia would've killed me years ago. 
The *only* reason I've lasted this long is years of carefully calibrated medication.
Same. Fuckin same.

I hate when I am talking to depressed people and mention that meds SAVED me and they go "dude meds aren't for me. They can change you man." and they look down on me for taking them. 


I really don't understand the whole antidepressant stigma. I fuckin love Zoloft. 
But the thing is, they do have similar views towards other drugs. Steve Jobs and his deal with cancer is probably the most famous example.
Gene stop it
Right?  The great outdoors will cure you from all diseases.  
Who do you mean by "you" exactly? I thought it was pretty clear that I'm pointing out the digracefulness of this image. 
/r/trees.
"They can change you". Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for!
First, anyone who looks down on you for taking medication prescribed to you for your issues is a fucking asshole, that's not okay, never ever will that be okay. Second, the reason a lot of people look down on things like antidepressants can be traced back to the insurance sector, many who need help for mental health issues go to their PCP and get prescribed antidepressants from someone who knows nothing about mental illness, this can lead to very bad things, these medications adjust brain chemicals, and if that isn't done by someone who knows what they're doing like say a psychiatrist, it can have very bad effects on the mind, hell even if you were prescribed a drug for mental illness by an expert it can still be very harmful as there aren't really absolutes in this field, I've taken many different medications for my illness and it's done some messed up stuff to me, but I'm not everyone else so I'm not going to say all mental health drugs are bad for everyone, but back to the point, the reason the insurance companies play a part in this is because treating mental illness with drugs is cheaper for them than actual therapy, bit as it's been shown time and time again, many need a mix of both, so this make people think that antidepressants or mental health drugs are bad when it's really just the fact that if they aren't prescribed right they can be harmful, so yeah, blame the assholes who would rather give you the cheap quick solution that can fuck you up, also big pharma has a hand in it too, all those ask you doctor about this drug and that lead people to thinking a pill alone will make all their problems go away, and when it doesn't, they blame the pill and not the assholes who advertised it to them. Sorry for the rant, just a topic that's a bit close to home for me hope I've been informative at least.
Don't worry fam I get you
I think he's referring to the people who created the image for likes or useless emotional nonsense. 
Lmao. My friend warned me once to not take my prescribed Xanax cause it would force me to suppress my thoughts/feelings. I was like O shit there is a pill for that? Lol

For who ever it may not be available to, you can find it on his FB page. https://www.facebook.com/LastWeekTonight?fref=nf
My only complaint is that I wish this segment was longer. 
One of the points made in the video was that gun control discussions are avoided by making mental health the main focus instead. Even [especially?] with the mindset that mental health care *is* the issue (it's not), gun control should still be the main focus when shootings occur; A lot of the perpetrators in these shootings *are* sane and mentally ill people are still going to be mentally ill whether or not the healthcare system works for them. Exercising more control over who has access to guns would have the potential to stop the minority who *are* mentally ill from committing these crimes and would also potentially stop some of the sane people too.
This is so important to talk about!
Seems as if they did very little research, and were using this as a guise to push an agenda for gun control.
I see too many mentally ill people populating public parks as their new home. Why do we not have mental health facilities that fit the breadth of the problem? 
As much as mental health education for the public is always needed, this shooting was not an example of mental illness, not unless you want to consider his religion and political ties to IS to be the illness.
Thanks, I didn't even think about that it might not be available to someone, although I have some troubles with music on YouTube in my country.
I usually just search for alternate uploads. Who knew John would be a more lenient publisher than HBO? :p
If you think a person who gets a gun, then goes on a killing spree and gets killed in the process is mentally healthy, I think you need to redefine what mentally healthy actually means.
> this shooting was not an example of mental illness

Which is exactly the point made by Oliver. He says that politicians use mental illness as an excuse for mass shootings to not having to talk about gun control.
Ties to Islamic State? Where are you getting that?
I think it would be more accurate to say it was a combination of factors including religious/political motivations, but underlying unaddressed mental health problems were also a significant factor. Sane, healthy, functioning people rarely pick up a gun and go on a killing spree, even if they have disagreements over politics or religion.
If he was going on /r9k/, he was definitely ill. That's one of the few core things that unites people on that board. 
I live in Australia. Lots of videos aren't available :P
I'm not saying that the Oregon shooter (of 2015, sad that I can specify) *was* mentally healthy; It seems from reports that he wasn't. What I'm saying (and perhaps didn't make clear) is that it's irrelevant whether he was or wasn't mentally ill/healthy. In the heat of the moment, however long that moment lasts, a mentally healthy person could still act on impulse or hold a grudge and go on to shoot someone. Many people have shot ex/partners or family members and not been considered mentally ill. What matters is that if gun control measures were tightened or changed to include a mental health assessment then *at least* a minority (around 5%, from the video) could potentially be stopped.
I think it's reasonable to point out that mentally unhealthy  (shooters) doesn't always mean diagnosed with a mental illness. So while catching and treating mental is incredibly important, it isn't the only thing that needs attention 

Edit-extra words
I would take it a step past gun control, and apply that to anything that doesn't fit their overall political narrative.  A story gets alternately promoted and buried as details emerge that fit their bias.  In the Oregon case, many news outlets have now buried it altogether once it came out that he was on European terror watchlists.
There is a large segment of the Middle East that would disagree with your statement.  For them, there is no bigger reason than religion to fire up the Genocidomatic 9000, yet as a whole they are considered not only sane by mainstream groupthink, but also some of the most educated.
Yeah I totally agree.

Hi Clinical Mental Health student here. I'm really interested in DID, some people believe it's bit of a taboo, since people often think people with DID are faking symptoms. However they also discredit EEG data that claims people who switch between alters show alpha brainwaves, which means they are at a calm state whereas if someone was lying their EEG data will looks a bit askew and show different movements. 

* How many alters do you have? Who are they? 
* You said DID is not like the movies. Have you seen the show United States of Tara, is that more accurate? I think it might be difficult to say, since everyone's experiences are different. 
* While you said it is difficult to stay with a therapist because they are always fired due to distrust, is this due to distrust among the different alters? Have you used self-help books like Dr. Dave Burn's Feeling Good? It sounds like you do your own version of Journal Therapy, which is great!

* How do you feel about your alters? Are you happy they are there to protect you from your past traumatic memories? 

* To transition between alters are there specific triggers? Do they come up randomly?

* How often would you say you are an alter compared to your normal self? Hours? Days? Weeks?

* When did you acquire your first alter?

Sorry for all of these questions, I'm just really interested in DID. 
Can your alters converse directly with each other? 

Do you share memories?

I have DID also and we can but I am curious if this is a common feature.
What are some of the things that the movies (and other forms of fiction) get wrong about DID?
Aside from the alters, do you have any other dissociative symptoms?
What therapies have you tried, and what parts do you feel helped the most?
If you developed it in response to a single event, are you aware of that event throughout your states? And how do you feel DID affects your relationships with others?
What is something you wish/want others to understand about your disorder? 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/amaaggregator] [I have Dissociative Identity Disorder and no, it's not like the movies. AMA!!!](https://np.reddit.com/r/AMAAggregator/comments/6kw6rk/i_have_dissociative_identity_disorder_and_no_its/)

Have you ever tried or considered hypnotherapy? I know some consider it a psudo-science but I had a close friend with DID who benefited from it. 
How do you react to people that pretend it's fun? I've seen no many people make videos on YouTube like "meet my alters" as if thats actually how it works.
Do you think this is a form of survival? Forgetting tragic past events?
What are ur different personalities like
This has been a fascinating read. Thank-you for sharing.
Have you ever read "Sybil" and if so, what did you think of it?
This may be late but I found out that my boyfriend apparently has DID. Though he's not even sure if he was officially diagnosed because he ripped up and threw away the papers. But it seemed like he went to a clinical psych eval if they gave him the report after. Though it didn't sound like what I've heard and am reading here. He said it's like there's different personalities inside him but it's all the same person, not like different people. If someone "switches" is it typical for others to notice? He had past abuse and says he can't remember a lot. I don't want to ask him too much in fear of bringing up bad memories. The thing I'm also wondering about is that he has auditory and rarely visual hallucinations, but that doesn't seem to be a symptom of DID, or is it? He said it's usually hearing voices of other people around him when they're not talking. 
Answering for myself for your knowledge, sorry if I am butting in.

5/6
Tommy (A Child), Kazarack (Emotionless and protective elder), Darican (Rebellious, confident, outgoing)
Tammy (Organised and constructive) Teranger (Just rage and darkness) Renki/Tori (Who I mean if I say me. The leader of my structure.

I have not seen the Show I am afraid 

My alters are a huge part of my life and I dislike extremely the idea of not having them

Some yes, Kazarack can't feel anger so jumps, but anything which triggers traumatic memories can trigger a switch or strong emotions. I can also concentrate and chose to change if we have not been forced to.

Usually up to 24 hours and can be as little as 2 minutes if they need to do something

When I was 8 in a combined schizophrenic and traumatic episode at school, my next two were like that too.
Also answering for your knowledge since I have DID.
4 alters that I know of: Nikki(a kid, usually comes out when people raise their voice), Cecil (A protective guardian), Jason (charismatic and manipulative with a distrust of people, hotheaded), Other (like Jason but doesn't show emotion).

Haven't seen the show but would like to check it out.

Not seeing a therapist now. I have too much in student debt and bills to afford one. I don't really have a journal but I do small cartoon drawings of alters on my calendar books of how they felt that day. I can also remember what happened on that day if I look back at it. That helps me a lot.

When I was younger (in teens) I was terrified of it and had less control. Often dissociative fugues affected me. Now the fugues don't happen as long or often.  My alters now make me feel more complete and I feel happy that they do protect me from a traumatic memory, however Jason and the Other can be sometimes hard to deal with as they want me or others to feel that pain. 

Nikki comes out when voices are being raised or if people are talking to me in a stressed tone.
Cecil comes out when there is a dangerous situation or can be a dangerous situation. 
Jason and the Other don't come out usually.

It can be from a few minutes to about a day. It used to last a week.

Jason came first around 9 years old when the traumatic experience happened. I guess Nikki was also an offshoot of that but wasn't as prominent as she and I were very similar in nature at the time. Cecil and the Other came around when I was 14 years old.

[deleted]
I space out pretty regularly and forget what I was doing. I forget whole days, even months. Mostly it's not concrete amnesia, it's more like trying to see through a frosted window. I don't remember emotions that the others felt. I don't really remember most of what they say. I get migraines and my depression is pretty bad. Insomnia keeps me from sleeping. 
I've tried a couple of therapists but somehow they always wind up getting fired because of a distrust within the system. I think journaling helps the most, and keeping notes and reminders around the house. 
No, I don't remember anything that happened to me when I was young, but a few of my alters do. They hold those memories for me so I don't have to live with what happened. And I think it affects my relationships differently, like depending on who it is and how they handle it. It has ruined an engagement before, but it's also brought me friends. So it's a bittersweet blessing in a way, lol. 
I wish people would see that we're not a threat to society, and we are good people. It's so easy to believe that it doesn't exist because the whole point of DID is to remain hidden, but I think that folks can benefit from learning about it. Recognizing that it's a real struggle and not a cop out is something I'd like, too. 
I haven't considered it but it's an intriguing approach. My psychiatrist recommended EMDR, is that a form of hypnotherapy?
It's insulting but I don't let it get to me. I believe there are some systems that are more progressed and have better communication between each Other, so it makes it easy for them to introduce themselves. It's harder for someone like me because my alters don't trust very well. And it's hard for me to get everyone on the same page. 
That's actually the whole purpose of it. They saved me when I was young and took the abuse so i didn't have to. 
I haven't read it but I've seen the movie and I think it's a poor portrayal of the disorder. 
Awesome, thank you for sharing, no need to apologize! Like I said I am interested and am eager to hear everyone's story. To me I also find it interesting how you said your alter Kazarack is like a protective elder, and it is the name of your reddit username. In addition browsing your comment history seems to have a nurturing tone as a protective elder would be. Thank you for answering my questions!  
Thank you for sharing! If you are interested in therapy look into volunteer therapists (google and see if there are any in your area.) Often these therapists work in non-profits and sessions can be free, or I've even seen places that have sessions range from $2-$55 depending on income and other expenses.

How did your alters play a role in your schooling? 
I can understand that point of view. My previous therapist ruled it out when he spoke with Molly without my knowing, and he said that my sense of having a "grey" perspective and ability to let go of things too. There was more to it that I'll explain in a bit, but that's an interesting thought. What else would you say that brings you to this diagnosis?
But here's the thing, are you a trained professional? I doubt that because you are talking about a possible diagnosis, online nonetheless, which is highly illegal and unethical. Really the only way to diagnose someone is through therapy. Please do not go around misdiagnosing people, especially if you are not trained or qualified. Most people who have already been diagnosed have been done so by a trained professional. 

Again the idea behind this post is to ask questions and learn. The Mental Health field constantly changes, but uses theories, case studies, and research to do so. Please do not use whatever information that you find on the internet to "diagnose" someone. 
Has the fact that your experience with therapists (and their distrust) put you off of other therapists?
I really can't help but be reminded of a game called Xenogears thinking about this. The protagonist also suffered from it and his alters had an antagonistic relationship to each other. Is that something you experience?
No, but EMDR has been shown to be very helpful. It actually causes new Neuro pathways to form. Hypnotherapy was used to help my friend switch from an alter to herself when things got bad.
I'm so sorry that happened to you. I don't why people are so cruel, makes me kind of not want to be on this Earth.
that's a coping strategy like another.....I used drugs....don't know which  one is worst honnestly haha
No volunteer therapy nearby at all. Would definitely have liked that. 

I've been an honors student since I can remember. The only time I was sent to the office was when I was in 1st grade. Myself and 3 kids were eating lunch slowly so our teacher took the rest of our class upstairs and said she will be back in 5 minutes. She did not come back. The principal saw us waiting at the lunch table and said basically yelled at us for it.

> which is highly illegal and unethical. Really the only way to diagnose someone is through therapy. 

None of that is true btw. Possibly unethical, but that sort of depends on with whom's ethical guidelines you follow. I agree with the rest of your post (save some word choices).

>Clinical Mental Health student here.

>I'm just really interested in DID.


You might find it interesting to look up the data on how many psychiatrists/ologists actually ddx DID. It's a very small number of practitioners that ddx the majority of cases (I cannot recall the exact numbers). Although, one can point out that if someone specializes in something (like dissociative disorders) they would be more likely to ddx them (and get referrals from other people when a case comes along that's outside that person's scope).

I agree with the general idea the commenter was pointing out... histrionic/factitious/malingering tends to be the case for DID. I don't think he necessarily needed to point it out in this case. Of course, issues with Sybil and the other first few case studies (they were all later shown to be cued or otherwise not DID), are still an issue in the literature. 

My research switched away from dissociative disorders (undergrad/masters) to schizophrenic spectrum (PhD Molecular Biology, psychopharmacology lab). So I'm not as up-to-date in the literature. However, last I knew it's only been recently (last 5ish years) that cases have come forward that were willing to be reviewed by other peers and they actually confirmed the ddx. Previously, there was no one subject that had been ddx'd by more than one group where both (or more) groups agreed DID was the case. 
Yes, because I don't know why I don't trust them. And I'm afraid that I'll never find someone to really listen without slapping down everything I say. The therapist I see now is alright, but she doesn't take what's in my brain and untangle it. She just listens. 
Sometimes. When I first realized what I had and the diagnosis came in, everyone sort of went into freak out mode, kind of like a "shit, I've been made" sort of thing. They kind of started to show themselves more rather than pretend to be me, and it wasn't always good. Molly felt left out by me and the others, and Ghost sort of got the brunt of everything. They pinned everything on her because they thought she was bad. It's confusing. 
I've been very interested in EMDR to help with flashbacks and emotional triggers. Did it help for her? The hypnotherapy?
I think that if we keep pressing on to be good, loving people, everything will be alright. Thank you, you're very sweet. 😊
Worst? What do you mean?
I understand the skepticism. A lot of people will take one look at this post or at me and go "oh, you have x, y, and z." But with all respect, you don't know me. That's what this post is about. I'm trying to end of negative stigma against people who deal with the issues I deal with. I woke up one day with gashes on my legs and blood on the sheets. I've overdosed and woke up frustrated with who did it or why. No I don't do drugs. No I don't drink. I do journal though. I do go to therapy. I do see psychiatrists. And DID is a dissociative disorder. It's what I deal with, and it's what I've dealt with my whole life. It's more common than you think.
Yeah my main idea was that you shouldn't necessarily diagnose someone you do not know over the internet, especially when you aren't qualified. I think it is unethical with the APA and ACA and can be justified that in the setting it is not a proper diagnosis. It's just a grey area that I wouldn't want to dance with. 


But like I have said prior, DID is seen as taboo and most do not diagnose the disorder. Some may be other disassociative disorders, some therapists/psychologist/psychiatrists may see the client as merely a mask to past traumas. I remember reading briefly about a study with DID ddx clients and actors. When transitioning through alters the DID clients showed alpha brainwaves vs the actors had noisier data when transitioning. (It might have been Schlumpf et al 2014's fMRI study or something similar, I read it about three years ago, so it's difficult to say if that was the study or not.) 
Confusing for sure. I know I couldn't even come close to imagining what it's like to actually live with it but this is a really interesting window. Thank you so much for sharing.
The worst
Also, none of those things that you said point to Borderline. 
Yeah you're right, I don't know you. I'm sorry. All the best. 
> Schlumpf et al 2014

I'll read it it. But having just pulled it up, I thought I might inform you of something (since you're looking at going into a scientific(ish) field). PLoS journals can be hit or miss, but PLoS ONE is a terrible journal that you absolutely shouldn't trust on face value. Since it's not exactly peer reviewed. There's an editor that reads the paper, and can choose to have another reviewer read it... and they accept 50% of submissions. My department actually forbids us to publish there.

edit: Having read the paper, it's pretty flawed. But interesting. Hopefully someone will do the same study with a statistically significant group.
No problem. 😊 thanks for asking.

Hits pretty close to home for me. The guilt I feel because of the way my condition has made me treat people around me hurts, a lot.

Thanks for posting :) 
I thought it was just me that treats people so badly, I tried to change, I want to change but somehow I always end up without anyone. Thanks for posting this, it made me realise my depression and anxiety are to blame and that I'm not just an awful person inside.
This makes me miss my friend who could've easily written this before he passed. Depression is the fucking devil.
While I can relate to the regrets, the last person who insisted that I open up to them replied to a text basically asking for help because I was having a panic attack with "I'm sick of hearing all of your negativity"

15 years down the toilet.  Although the guilt trips and attempts to get me to be friends with someone that, professionally speaking, stabbed me in the back simply because she wanted a simpler social calendar certainly weren't very endearing.

So there's that.

I expect her to reach out once her mother complains (this is a 40 some odd year old woman whose​ mother loves me because I used a Groupon that was about to expire to send her soup when she was just getting out of the hospital post surgery).

I'll have to figure out if she's getting dead air or hate.  Guess it'll depend on my mood.
You're not alone, friend. 

Thank you for doing this for us. I'll help. What do I do?
Your dedication is admirable. 
You're a nice ass dude OP. Hope good things come back round to you for this.
This warmed my heart. Thank you for trying your best to respond to everybody.
Hey /u/_Mechaloth_ ...you deserve everything for this service you did today. Seriously...you made a positive impact on this world and you should give yourself a pat on the back for it. I've found that often those most wanting to help others sometimes need help themselves but don't ask or expect due to not wanting to burden others....you seem like a really selfless person so I just want to check in and make sure everything is all good in your world. How are you doing? Take care of yourself. I hope this whole thing never gave you undue stress or burden...make sure to unwind sometime this week and do something relaxing you really enjoy. Promise me you'll treat yourself with something special. Because you really deserve it bro/sis <3 
Yeah, I'll start following.  If it completely floods my homepage I will probably end up unfollowing, to be honest.  But I'll start trying to help out there, for MH related asks.

Its been over a day since you made the Askreddit and almost a day since this post. Someone replied to my comment and I'm starting to reply to others. You're a good person OP. Thank you!
So much love and respect to you for your efforts. And to all of you for pitching in. Please also take time to take care of yourself and not burn out. As we grow, more and more people are sharing their stories and we can all help out even just by acknowledging people and sending encouragement. 

We are a community and with each others' support we can do amazing things. 
You are a kind soul 
Been helping a little, thanks for giving us the opportunity. Man you are quick though! Good for you!
I'm trying to go down into the buried comments and respond to each of them in a way that acknowledges their struggles and attempts to stimulate further conversation. If I manage to get caught up, then I'll start responding to their replies.

The priority right now is making sure everyone is at least acknowledged. I'm off to work again, so I'll be back around 8pm or so. Going to be a long, but excellent, evening.
Thank you. I've been helped before, so I want to pay it forward.
Even if they don't, it's been a great experience. I'm really hoping that this small action keeps moving forward to others who need the help.
It's tough. But I know I wouldn't want to feel ignored. Thanks for the kind words!
Everything is good, my friend! Struggling for cash a bit, but who isn't in today's economy?! I'll admit that I've been getting a little emotionally invested in those who have replied, and have lost some sleep, but I do have a special something in mind to help unwind. Thank you for all your help and support!
Thank you. I really appreciate it. I'll jump back in on my lunch break.
You've been rocking it! Thanks for everything you've done so far; I truly appreciate your efforts - and I know the community does as well!
Thank YOU! It's awesome that you're helping others out, even when there's no obligation to do so. Keep the support going, my friend!
As are you. Thanks for extending your support to me!
It's tough to keep up, but I am making little dents here and there whenever I have a spare moment. Right now I'm on break at the museum.
Ok, I'll try my best to at least respond to those who've been there the longest on the list.
I think you deserve a break. Please don't use up your good energy replying to me. Here, have some of my positive energy and keep up the good work 🍀
Carrie Fisher, amongst many of the celebrity deaths this year has highlighted something for me that I didn't quite expect. An outpouring of praise and emotion for people who struggle with mental health, by people who don't understand it or have the patience for it. For someone such as myself, who struggles with mental health, it has made my own reality with disease much harder.

&nbsp;

        

Living in the internet age, there has been a certain reverence for celebrities *who are already liked* who struggle with mental health and then pass away. Their death is seen as tragic, and possibly preventable if people around them had, *somehow*,  had a better grasp on mental health issues. Yet it is these same people, who I then approach, who have little patience for the mental health issues of those nearby to them.

&nbsp;


In my own experience, I talked to my best friend about my trouble with anxiety, and was met with dismissive responses. I understand that empathy is difficult, but when they (and MANY others) attempt to publicly empathise with celebrities who suffer similiar circumstances, it becomes very frustrating and painful. 

&nbsp;

How about you? What are your experiences? Have recent events improved or worsened your ability to communicate with friends about your health*?

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
* I consider mental health equal to physical health
I agree with you in every case BUT Carrie Fisher actually. 

I had been experiencing the same kind of frustration with people, a sort of, "if you can understand that, why not me?" I was very frustrated.

With the death of Carrie Fisher, especially since it was ostensibly from a physical health issue (albeit as a result of poor mental health earlier in her life), it has opened doors and cracked windows for conversations with people that wouldn't have otherwise been able to understand. 

Carrie was VERY pubic about her illness and had her episodes publicly. She publicly sought multiple hospitalizations, ECT, and "multiple medications." She publicly struggled with stability until the end of her life. Allegedly, in the new documentary coming out about her and her mother (that she mostly produced), near the end there is a point where her mom falls ill and Carrie has a manic episode because she doesn't deal with it well. Carrie never tried to hide those things. Her books are full of frank discussions of her illness and treatment experiences. 

That advocacy that she did, even though many people aren't aware of it, gives me a great place to start a conversation from. If someone who is normally dismissive about my bipolar illness brings up what a tragic loss Carrie is, I can agree, and then I can fill them in on how she was more than just a princess. 

People know me. They know how bipolar looks in me and they think they see things that are "personality" that are really "illness" related. They sometimes are confused or upset when I am not consistent. When someone they thought they knew, like Carrie Fisher, who has been around and on screen for 40+ years, and with whom they have created a kind of relationship passes, they learn all about that person's life and have sympathy for all of their struggles. They can see Carrie as a whole person because they always have. 

My goal now is just to sort of transfer that back to me. It has worked with at least one person. It's a question of showing them that she had access to the best resources, the best care, the best facilities and still struggled. She was still in and out of hospitals. She still had to take meds. She still had episodes. It shows people that it's a lifelong thing and she humanizes things in a way that I should be able to, but cannot. 

Yes, that is frustrating to answer your question but Carrie's death is somehow less so.
At least in recent times, celebrities have been *allowed* to have mental illness. Think of how, in decades previous, someone like Brian Wilson was treated by the press. Had Brian Wilson suffered his mental breakdown in 2016, fans and the media would be like, "Get better Brian! We love you!" instead, back in the 60s, he was regarded as a pathetic slob who couldn't get his shit together - by the press, by fans, even his own bandmates. 

I'm grateful for how the culture has been able to grow in terms of accepting mental illness, but there's still such a long way to go. And we're talking about celebrities - we've only been able to reach that place of acceptance for famous people, and I see a great many people treat those with mental illnesses as if they were worse than second-class citizens. It's like there's a protective *aura* around celebrity that makes *their* mental illnesses "okay." Like, it's okay to have a personality disorder if it comes accompanied by musical genius - but if you're just some average schmuck out in the boondocks just struggling to get by, then screw you for being born "weak." There's some Social Darwinism at work here too.
Ugh. Yes.

Although, should say: my agreement is based on the assumption that you mean mental illness, rather than mental health. 
Sadly, I don't think this double standard will ever change. A regular person is "mentally ill" and are ostracized. A celebrity is mentally ill, but they get heralded as a hero who is brave.

I am not saying one or the other should be favored, but instead I wish society as a whole could just be more understanding for both extremes. Many people have their share of demons, yet celebrity ones are respected.
Many people seem to be their idealised self (sympathetic and caring) in response to idealised others (celebrities).  

I guess they don't have to worry that caring about a celebrity will lead to the celebrity calling them at 2am in the morning having a breakdown or something.  Obligation-free caring and concern is awesome - all the benefits of looking like a socially aware human being, none of the consequences!!!  /sarcasm
> Their death is seen as tragic, and possibly preventable if people around them had, somehow, had a better grasp on mental health issues.

You realize Carrie Fisher died of a heart attack right?

Let's use some of those tax dollars spent on national defense to help train and prepare our civil servants for situations like these. 

Funny, depression is now one of the trailing causes of illness and disability in my life these days. It's more about the anxiety tbh

Good luck. Give it time. And don't give up. It may not be the right one. It's trial and error. But good luck, my dude. Keep fighting the good fight. 
I've been on duloxetine for about a year now and I can honestly say it has helped me. It's not a miracle drug (what is?) but if you have CBT accompanying it, have supportive people around you and have a long term plan, then it will get better. 

Best of luck to you.
Good luck. Is this your first antidepressant? 
Good luck, see how it works for you.  If it's not great, Effexor is pretty similar and so switching to it from Cymbalta isn't difficult.  I had no luck with Cymbalta but Effexor really helped me out.
Good luck and welcome to the club. 
Good Luck!
Good luck. Please make sure you report all effects to your doctor. :)
Hello! I've been on Cymbalta for over a year now, and it's done really good things for me! I found (as most do, apparently) that I went up for a month or two, then crashed a bit, then went up again and stabilised. It's helped me get the motivation to get out of bed and start doing positive things to help my depression :)
Good luck!
Do you think if you never took meds then you wouldn't be relapsing so much?
Thanks so much. I've given up on other meds before, but this time I intend to stick with it for a while.
Thanks for saying this. I am in therapy, have been for 5 months. We finally realized I needed something a little more, and after going over it with my PCP, I decided to start meds. Did you feel either insomnia or extreme drowsiness in the beginning?
I've made attempts with Zoloft, celexa and Paxil in the past. The most recent was Zoloft in 2011. None of them lasted more than 2 weeks.
Thanks! Do I get a membership card?
Thank you. :-)
Yeah, I'm already making a list.
I honestly never took any of the other ones long enough for it to matter. Last time was 2011 and it was like 2 weeks max I was on it. Before then 2008 and 2006.

Basically things would get bad, I'd try something, hate the side effects, take myself off of them then suffer through the depression.
Yeah, going on them and going off (which I've unfortunately have had a number of times due to poor planning) has had noticeable side-effects. For me, it hasn't been insomnia or drowsiness, but dizziness mostly. 
It takes time until it reaches its effect, just be aware of what's happening and if it's changing you. For example I feel grumpy when I'm experiencing dizziness and knowing that won't make me at least appear grumpy and lash out to people. 
Why no longer than two weeks?
Side effects weren't fun and I was always stubborn about having to take meds for my mental state. Unfortunately it's so bad now that I don't really have a choice but to stay on them for the foreseeable future.
I hope they work for you. But if not, you could reconsider some of your previous meds. The side effects can take a little longer than two weeks to decrease.

Just say what you wrote "I'm not going to hurt myself but I'm not ok and I need help" 

He sounds like a good, supportive guy that'll understand. 
Wake him up.  If he's worried enough about you to elicit that promise from you, he'd much rather be woken up at 5 am than sleep through an episode where you need his support.
Hi there,
You're a pretty remarkable person.  Being able to share this is very brave of you and I don't even know you but I am very proud of you.  (high five!)

Thank you for putting your thoughts out there.  My wife has similar struggles and I want to help her but she's stuck in the stigma that this is just her and there is nothing she can do.  I've tried to understand how she is feeling and this post helps me a lot.

What coping strategies or methods do you use?  My wife finds comfort in dance and colouring.
Asking for help is hard. Keep fighting and ask for help when you need it. You will be okay.
That's some great processing and self reflection and self awareness right there. From all that you've written, what stood out for me was the way you recognised your brain for being a dumbass. The same brain who's being a jerk and gives you all these bad thoughts is the same brain that makes you such a beautiful person, who's doing great work reflecting, processing, understanding what's real and what's not. Wake him up next time it happens, the hug or the kiss he'll give you or the word he'll say will mean so much to you in that moment. 
Wake him up. It's what he wants you to do; I struggle with this same thing, but he is your partner and he wants to be there for you. 
I really relate to this.  The shame of feeling like I need some love or attention so urgently causes my instinctive defence mechanism to cue up, which says "why do you need this?  You must be terrible if you do.  Normal people don't need what you do. " etc. Etc. Until I'm in a full blown shame spiral.

Then I feel like any attention I receive is out of pity and not genuine. It makes it so hard to ask, that I can get trapped by my own expectations. 

I would say I feel lucky though that I also now understand that physical touch and affection almost always trumps it all.  When I need something, as long as it isn't all the time (which it never is) just asking to be held by itself is healing, then if I actually get held, that's even better. Sometimes I can ask to be held by multiple people in a day, and they all say yes, even if it's just a long hug, or holding my hand or arm. It's not all on my girlfriend, nor any of my other friends, everyone can be a part, and I won't melt if one person says no. 

OP, I hope you can find the support you need in life to know that asking for the things you need in life is healthy and wonderful and honoring to those who love us.  I know it's a long hard road, but I hope you can at least get a window into in by screwing up and asking completely wrong a few times :-)  

It gets so much better from here. Good travels! 
That allergy excuse and immense guilt you feel for your partner, suicidal attempts and ideation...you put into words what I've been doing/feeling for years. I don't know what to say to help you, but I just want to say thank you. Because it helps to have someone to relate to. I feel like I'm a bit less alone. 
Exactly! The same brain that negatively affects your mental health is telling you you'll be dumb or a jerk for waking him up, ultimately, that his comfort is more deserving than your mental health. He can certainly fall back asleep; and you are worthy and deserving of mental support in a time of need. Take care OP.

This is pitiful. What a crappy magazine to post that.
This shit should really be illegal.
Oh, for fucking crying out loud!
We should also blur out the kids like they do in Europe
Pfft. They don't know the meaning of insane. Wait 'till someone bombs their offices. 

I just wanted to say you are incredibly gifted at drawing, and yeah I know that feeling...
Such a beautiful drawing for such a terrible feeling. Great work!
Wow very good drawing
Lovely. Thank you for sharing. :)

Same time tomorrow? haha.
feeling sexy? yes, me too...
Thank you so much. I've always loved doing it, but sometimes get those pesky voices in my head that tell me I'm no good, so I really appreciate the comment. I'm sorry you've been in that place too, and I hope things get better for you.
Thank you very very much. It's nice knowing that I'm not the only one who feels that way at times.
Thank you much!
And thank you very much for commenting! Ideally yes, I'm trying to get in the habit of sketchbooking daily. Gotta keep myself motivated!
Things did get better, though I still have days where I can't get out of bed. Having two always hungry cats seem to help though! 

I can't draw very well but tried sketching one of my cats once. It was a very pleasant experience, you should do it even if the voices in your head say no
No problem. Keep it up, and all the best!

I was inspired by a piece of art on r/creepy titled sociopath. I'm not a sociopath. 

It took me 20 minutes and I have no patience but I am fed up of having to explain things... The cuts with the blood are my self-harm scars new one as of today is the one on my forearm.. the labels are my diagnostic labels and one is being torn off soon. 

The 4 zones in my head is my trauma as a child. The one below is my fear of my sexual sadism overcoming me and murdering my friend (why I self-harm, but I would never do it) and the two on the left represent my mood when I am elated. And the bottom left (portrait's right) is me with my friend and how I love her. 

I hate this mask I wear the guilt spreads all over me.
Yes I am that skinny, no I eat, I just don't have an appetite and my Thyroid is fine. 


This is so awesome!!! Drawing out my mental health, or other such impossible-to-word things, has been amazing. Like I finally got it all out of me in a form that fully makes sense, and it's in a permanent form that I don't have to remember and keep sharing in the hopes someone hears me - now I can see myself on the paper, and I usually have some hope that maybe someone else will too. 

Thank you for sharing the drawing, and for the interpretive comment as well to help us explore your art as you intended.
Do you listen ambient music when doing this?
Wonderful
Except my parents will probably burn it, and threaten to call the police (I'm 18, I wanna join the police after my degree, I am pretty law savvy... I usually have a laughing fit before they scream in my ear about something stupid like "blah blah [conservative statement] and we're very liberal, and you can't do this, you're perverted you are a monster, you are horrible, you lie and you are selfish..."
Goldberg variations... And umm like some what's it called my moody spotify playlist about usually love, sex and murder.... Loss and anti-religious debauchery, nihilism, the fallibity of humanity and vague ideas of covert narcassism, black widows and other dangerous folk... Good fun ;)
Nah I know a bit rubbish, I am far better at drawing women. Should see a portrait of my friend I did haha, she loved it. 

For now I will draw a vw beetle... Because I would like to. 
Ugh, family can be such pure hell, that sucks. I hope you find a better living situation soon, whether thru joining the military or otherwise.
It's too bad, family support can be very important, so you don't feel alone.

This is insightful, and I've never really thought of it this way. People tend to portray depression and anxiety as an outside force acting on their "true self." But, I've been depressed so long that I identify with depression as my true self. I don't know who or what I would be without it.
I had this issue going to counseling for the first time. I was told to find ways to distract from or change negative thoughts.. my anxiety and depression isn't from some negative thoughts. It feels like an inherent part of me. Thinking I'd be better off dead, hating myself, etc, are truths in my mind. I can't give myself a mental pep talk when my baseline is hating myself.
Interesting observation. I think, for my self, I tend to talk to myself in the second person. As if there are two Me's, one that is depressed and one that is trying to keep the other going. But as you stated it is my own voice and identity in either case.
I think it stems from the experience of people whose experience is typically with mild forms of depression ( or in trying to relate it to people who only experience mild or acute forms of depression ). The prevailing opinion is that depression is an illness, which implies that there is something changing one's behavior. Nobody wants to think another person's default outlook is depressed. So instead it's characterized as an outside force or entity though it may be one's "default".

I bet the terminology and metaphors are arranged to make the unafflicted feel better -- Uncle Jerry killed himself​ because he wasn't thinking straight, depression did that to him.
Yeah I agree, a big part of dealing with it for (which I struggle with sometimes) is recognizing when i'm talking to myself disrespectfully, recognizing when i'm feeling isolated or need to bbt myself, and learning how to recognize it when it's happening. This can be hard though because you have to distinguish yourself from the depression and anxiety, and sometimes you're not sure when it's you or the depression/anxiety talking. Just my two cents!
Well I think that's part of the problem for most of us. It is an outside force in many ways, but we identify with it and come to think of it as a natural and unchangeable part of ourselves.
If feel like this too. I tell people the situations that I am extra vulnerable to depression, but I don't think that get it. Major change up to my routine, moving to a new apartment, high stress, long stretches of isolation.... I think about it more like a facet to my personality. Though one I try to steer clear of. 
I'm in the hospital and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder yesterday. Trying to explain this to my loved ones was hard but this comment made me realize that's what it's like in my head- two me's lol

Ditto. It's nothing personal. Just need to not be around anyone or doing anything. 

That's pretty clever, but also sad.
I do pretty much exactly that all the time. After I got down with all the following:

1) The Patterns & Characteristics of Codependence on the Codependents Anonymous website;

2) This article on the [Consensus Trance] (https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+for+Recovery+from+the+Consensus+Trance); 

3) The "Karpman Drama Triangle" schematic of control strategies in interpersonal relationships; 

4) Codependents Anonymous and Emotions Anonymous meetings (you can find meeting locators on their websites);

5) "Jiddu Krishnamurti on Loneliness vs. Being Alone" at pairadocks.blogspot.com, further quoting a young Krishnamurti on being *alone* vs. being *lonely*; 

6) Practicing some thought questioner & mindfulness inducer like the "10 StEPs of Emotion Processing" at pairadocks.blogspot.com, so that one is able to continue to *sense* what is going on and know what to do about it;

7) Carefully reading the lyrics while listening to Alanis Morrissette's CD / MP3, "Jagged Little Pill";

8) Pia Mellody's book, *Facing Codependence*;

9) Anne Wilson Schaef's book, *Co-Dependence: Misunderstood, Mistreated*; 

10) Barry & Jane Weinhold's book, *Breaking Free of the Codependency Trap*;

11) Susan Forward's book, *Emotional Blackmail* on manipulative relationships;

12) Patricia Evans's book, *Controlling People* on the same topic;

13) DBT's "FAST" boundary-setting skills set (on DBTSelfHelp.com).

This is a metaphor for suicide, not stepping out for a smoke. OP I'm sorry you feel so low; I understand. I hope you find a positive and driving force somewhere, pharmaceutical or otherwise.

I wish a major card supplier like hallmark would pick these up. I think it could go a long way towards de-stigmatizing mental illness. Really great work!!!!!!!!!!!
meseeks!
I like them a lot! It made me feel a bit better already!
I love them 
[deleted]
Thank you! :)

And right!? All of their cards are so terrible. Sigh. 
Is this a good thing? lol
Thank you! That's the best thing to hear.
Thank you! <3
Thank you so much :)
Seriously. 'sorry for your loss' sounds so insincere. Maybe some day these companies will up their game :D
They look like these creatures called meseeks from the tv show Rick and Morty. It's just a funny coincidence :) but on a more serious note, this is a fantastic idea! Thank you for doing this :)
Ohhh haha. Omg you're totally right. My characters will never look the same again :P

 I think people are more and more aware of mental illness and disorders.

Mental Illness need campaign like Cancer.

Do pharmacists earn a 6 figure income? I'm thinking Canadian pharmacists here but I really have no clue.
It's not a weakness to be on an antidepressant. 
Thanks! Hopefully it sticks this time. 
Average income is like $95-106k 
Just checked salary.com. Median income for a Chicago pharmacist is $125,000. I know, right!?

Living this. :-( My mom keeps reminding me that time is going by (and I'm doing nothing) and it just makes me more anxious.
[Source post](http://sarahseeandersen.tumblr.com/post/32526000367).

That is me


Have you tried slowly stepping it up to seeing a therapist? You can start by talking here, then move to 7cupsoftea.com, then move on to Skype therapy, and then begin meeting with a therapist in-person. I've worked with clients that I spoke to over the phone for a month, then met them at a location near their home where they knew the exits and safe places to go, and then progressively got them to the office for 50 minutes (after combining phone time on their way to the office with in-person time until all 50 minutes were in-person). 
This is a perfect example of the fundamental difficulty with therapy. It's HARD! Making fundamental changes to your life, altering your patterns of behavior, and essentially relearning new ways of being in relationships is incredibly difficult and often painful. But I assure you, OP, it is not impossible, only difficult, and it is so worth it in the end. I wish you strength and courage. 
Ultimately *you,* the patient, have to make the first step toward treatment. Therapists and other providers will always be there, but it is your choice if you wish to hide under your bed your entire life. They aren't psychic - if you don't take that first step and ask for help, they certainly won't come find you.

You may even die there under your bed, if you really want to. But if you don't have at least enough strength to pick up a phone and ask for help, no power on earth can grant it to you or make you ask. We live in a free society: you are free to ask for help or not.

Take some Xanax and chill out!!
Stupid? So the anxiety that keeps me from being able to talk to a therapist is stupid? Very ignorant statement.
[deleted]
Not sure why you're saying these things. I don't think I'm a special unique person but you're basically saying that I need to get over myself. It's not that simple. If it was, I would do it. 
And thanks for reminding me that my habits are damaging my life. I'm well aware of that. This is a helpful statement.
[deleted]
Are you trying to help? You're just being a dick. Seeing a therapist is hard. Sometime people aren't ready to overcome that anxiety, or need help getting there. Shit, I wouldnt even be looking at new therapists if my boyfriend hadn't agreed to come with me to my first appointment, he's my rock and helps give me that little nudge.

OP hasn't been able to overcome his anxiety. This doesn't mean he's a bad or weak person. Just because "tons of people" have overcame it and saw a therapist doesn't mean OP is ready. You being a dick doesn't make him anymore ready.
[deleted]
I'm pretty sure op is aware he has the physical ability to go. The fact of the matter is he's nor yet ready to face his anxiety, and there's nothing wrong with that. It takes time for someone without an anxiety disorder to work up the guts to see a therapist, it takes even longer for someone with an anxiety disorder. He'll go when he is ready to face his anxieties or when he has some support system that can help him go.

I just read the title to this and the first thing I thought is 

"In other news:Water is Wet!"

And after reading it, I stand by that.
I think it depends.

I've had this experience exactly, but I've also had days where all the goals in the world just don't matter to me. They fade away, like colors in a hot wash and don't even cross my mind. It's as if something blocks me from being able to see them. Those are the days that pleasure is obscured and even if I intellectually want to do something, my heart can't seem to reach that same platform enough to advance me into action. ...if this stems from not being able to reach my goals over time, I'm not sure. It could be that, or it could very well be 100% chemical, depending on the day.
I think the definition of "failing" needs some work here...

I have a client (can't get/hold a job, so I freelance) who has recently asked me to help him on a pet project of his.  It has absolutely nothing to do with our normal business relationship (IT Consulting), but he also won't take no for an answer, so I'm working with him in Powerpoint (kill me now edition).

However, I also have a little bit of a creative background, having closed my film studio some 8 or so years ago.  And will take on the occasional Photoshop battle.

The client's request?  Lines on a map.

Is the client happy?  Ecstatic.

Am I happy with the work?  It's absolute shit.  Some of my worst, including when I whip out my tablet at the bar and try to draw at 3AM.
I wouldn't doubt this on the whole, but it's certainly not the case personally.  

I've been successful in most of the significant things I've put my mind to; I just can't figure out why being successful at things is all that much better than just dropping dead.

So the lacking-motivation thing seems  to hold there.
just had such a day yesterday! this theory certainly matched that time...
Has any follow-up work been done on this?

Its hard to provide services to a population that doesn't want to be seen, particularly when it's in a society that would prefer not to see them. Well that's how it is in the U.S. 
A "civil, intelligent society" and homeless mentally ill people are mutually exclusive.

This is misleading. It doesn't say anything about everyday clinical judgements about suicidal risk. It looks at risk factors in the research literature. Clinicians are quite capable to predict suicidal behaviours better than chance.
> Meanwhile, machines are increasingly overtaking researchers trapped in this mode of thinking. In the past two years, multiple groups have begun work developing “machine learning algorithms” to combine tens or even hundreds of risk factors together to predict suicidal behaviours. “The preliminary results are promising, with algorithms predicting suicidal behaviours with greater than 80 per cent accuracy, but this work is just in its initial phase,” said Franklin. “However, in the very near future, this work may produce accurate predictions of suicidal behaviours on a large scale.”

> His team has already developed a free web app that has proven effective in trials at reducing suicidal behaviours. The app, called “Tec-Tec” uses a simple game to train users to see certain words and images in a different light (a form of “evaluative conditioning”) and is available on iTunes and Amazon right now. Studies have shown that the app reduced suicidal behaviours by about 50 per cent over the course of a month in hundreds of people, and they hope in the future to reach a reduction rate approaching 100 percent.

This should be the headline. Great news! 
Half the psych apps out there are dubious. Half the rest are worse than useless. Maybe ten percent are actually worth using. 

"Hey!!! There's money to be made in advertising to the desperate and gullible! I want some of that money." Eeeeeesh. 
I just downloaded Tec-Tec. I don't understand the method yet but it is a fun game! I need to research evaluative conditioning. 
Eh, rule of thumb with science journalism-- assume it's bullshit unless it's literally about the breakthrough being available to the general public, and even then don't assume the marketing until it's been tested a while. 
What the fuck is the point? Are we just trying to figure out how to prolong peoples suffering in a hope that we figure out how to end it? What use does this app have if it even works? It stops you from killing yourself. Grand. Now what? Who is gonna help you get out of the situation that made you want to kill yourself? FUCKING NOBODY
I think this is kind of CBT related with the purpose of changing your overall thought patterns. Once you shake up those patterns then you have the opportunity to evaluate your thoughts more objectively and maybe get help for bigger issues. We're all just kind of living on auto-pilot but there are ways to hack our brains and become the people we want to be. 
>Are we just trying to figure out how to prolong peoples suffering in a hope that we figure out how to end it?

Well.... yes? How is it a bad thing to avoid that a patient kills him/herself while you are trying to help? You might not realize how extremely widespread suicidality is in the clinical population and how many previously suicidal patients now lead fulfilling lives.
Because. There's always the unfixables. A million a year whose suffering was prolonged because of false promises. It can always get better. Time heals all wounds. Well, apparently not. Maybe you should try on a suicidal brain before you assume anything.
There aren't "unfixables". That's a very cold, destructive, dehumanizing word.

Thing is, if we stop doing suicide assessments, a huge amount of people who would have lived and recovered, will die instead. Now, for those who have serious mental disorders for a long time, it's important to focus on improving their lives *given* their current condition, and not store people in institutions waiting for something which may never arrive. Modern psychiatry could really improve on that point.
So I'm a non-offending pedophile. 

I was abused as a kid, so I know what it's like and what it does to you. That's the main thing that keeps it in check most of the time. But quite often, I really struggle with it. It's not as if you can just avoid children, but they're everywhere. 

I really don't want to ruin some kid's life, nor do I want to ruin my life. 

I don't even really know why I'm posting this, but I've never been able to tell anyone, so here I am. I did tell a shrink once, but they didn't take it well

I've never viewed CP, and I don't plan to. Doing so just increases the demand for more.

Anyway, quite often, I will follow girls around at the store or wherever and leer at them. I know it's fucking creepy, but I can't help it.

I really hate myself for this :(
Well I first want to applaud you for not acting out on any of those urges. I know the majority of people don't take well to pedophiles but it is an illness. At least that's how I view it. I also want to applaud you on being so honest about this. I cannot imagine how difficult it must be to deal with those thoughts daily. 

I do recommend finding another therapist. Don't give up on therapy. It takes awhile to find a good one, trust me. Whether it's a patient with depression or like yourself, it takes awhile to find a therapist someone is comfortable with. Everyone has a strong reaction to pedophila but a good therapist will subdue those feelings to help you as that is their job. 

Don't hold those emotions in, you need to be able to discuss this with someone. 

I will be honest and say those type of urges will never go away but with skills you learn in therapy will you help overcome them. I wish you the best of luck and all the strength in the world to manage those urges to keep the children and yourself safe
Just because one shrink is not receptive with your discomfort it doesn't mean they all are. I don't know if you are in the US, but you can look up counselors, support groups, and psychiatrists based on their speciality on www.psychologytoday.com. I'm not sure, but maybe one who specializes in childhood and/or sexual trauma maybe able to help. 
Well I think that in the professional realm, too many therapists want to pretend that they are so progressive and above it all and then become shocked by their own previously unknown bias when they are faced with non-offending or offending sufferers of pedophilia. 

In fact, one of the things I HATE with a passion is the "you are a pedophile and should be put down" bullcrap. Of course nobody is wanting to, accepting, or condoning acting on it, but I think if someone like you can be brave enough to come out and admit it AND seek legitimate help, then they out to be treated like any other human being. 

I've had a former colleague tell me that pedophiles don't deserve treatment, yet he had treated violent ex-felons. I don't get it. You are a HUMAN BEING and deserve empathy. Of course I don't agree with the act if it happened, but I always always always take at least a minute and think (because I council a couple of sex offenders) about their pasts. 

Here is why I say that. First, what happened to them in their past? So man times I hear about the adults who offend who are C-PTSD survivors and have been brutalized while young. But that is nothing compared to the exceptional hypocrisy of point two.

Second, I know that we are all shocked and horrified when an non-offender acts out. And yes it is terrible. But I always wondered something deep in my mind. We are all upset that he or she offended and harmed a child, and yes consequences should happen, but is anyone interested in the little kid inside the offender who was tortured? No probably not because that would involve actual thought. 
there was a documentary posted about this in /r/documentaries recently. He was speaking about a supportive group he's apart of. I'd suggest you checking that doc out and maybe look into that group for support. 

EDIT: found for you 

 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5lepx9/inside_the_life_of_a_virtuous_paedophile_2016this/
Good on you for not viewing CP. I know that many so-called "non-offenders" view it, which is just so wrong for the reason you stated. So again, you're a GOOD PERSON for not contributing to that horrible industry. Definitely find a therapist who specializes in sexual stuff. It really sucks that your last therapist reacted badly, they shouldn't have done that.
Do you actually want to - or are you just trying to understand the person who abused you? 

Find someone you can talk to - consider looking up therapists who deal with this - forensic psychologists deal with ppl who have been accused/convicted so your thinking is not going to be unfamiliar - if anything they should have a professional curiosity about how you have managed/contained it. You obviously know it's not a line you want to cross but don't know why the line is so attractive - find out why and get away from it. Crossing it doesn't help - that grass is not greener and the pain doesn't go away.
Why avoid them? If anything, that would just make them abstract people who you only interact through fantasy, giving unrealistic expectations of them (even if you consciously realize any fantasies you may have may be uncharacteristic of children in general at first). I imagine some normal interactions and regular interactions with children would give you more a more realistic conscious and subconscious view of them and make you much less desperate (so hopefully you'd stop doing things like following strangers around in public). 

If you have a problem not sexually assaulting people you are around who are sexually attractive to you, that has nothing do with whether you are a pedophile or not and you should seek help for that problem. Although you should probably keep it a secret that you are a pedophile if you are going to say you are a threat to those around you to a psych.  But more than likely, I suspect you're just being overly paranoid about yourself. 

(disclaimer: in no way do I have any types of qualifications as a psychologist. Just another pedophile chiming in)
You are fine, you are a good person. If you need to talk PM me. 
Good thing you are aware of your sexuality. Don't blame yourself for feeling how you feel, you didn't choose this. But you are not powerless, you do have a choice: how you want to handle how you are feeling. This is your choice.
And you did make that decision already by saying you don't want to harm anyone. 


I don't know where you live, but in Berlin the Charite hospital started a program called "Don't offend" for people who are in the exact same situation like you: https://www.dont-offend.org

Maybe even if you live far away contact them and they might be able to help you.
I wish there would be more places you can go or people you can contact. I wish more people with pedophilic tendencies had the courage you have and seek help.


I'm on mobile so I can't do proper research but This American Life did a piece on pedophilia with another non-offender. He had started an online support group so I bet you could find something like that with some effort. 

I've posted to many people with pedophic urges over my years (mostly on /r/suicidewatch) and I understand it takes so much strength to get through your day. I want you to know that not everybody listens to their viceral reactions (look at you!) and that there are people out there who want to see you helped/ help you. You've got a mental illness I liken to OCD, did you know some people get intrusive thoughts telling them to harm/ kill their loved ones? I get this is distinct from but I personally consider them related. And some of us are working on how to actually help people with these issues, just not fast enough from the perspective of anyone who's in it.
Thank you for not acting on it. That therapist should not have acted poorly. Its their job not to judge. I hope you can find a better shrink as you say. Seriously, thank you for not acting on it. 
I applaud you for speaking about this. I know it can be hard. Someone very close to me also has those urges. I implore you to find a new therapist. It might be hard because people are not as open minded as they should be, but make sure they understand you're trying to seek help. 
"Anyway, quite often, I will follow girls around at the store or wherever and leer at them. I know it's fucking creepy, but I can't help it."


You can help it. Of course you can. You are in control of your actions 100%.

Please seek help OP. CBT might help you control your behaviours.
Try looking into neurofeedback treatment or behavioral therapy. Behavioral therapy to build up your tool kit, but maybe psychanalytic to get at the root of your issues.
The original poster never responded to any of the "helpful" posts. Interesting. 
Is there some medication to block out these intrusive thoughts? I take medication for intrusive thoughts. These same meedications dampen my sex drive. Perhaps they would be helpful to youu too. 
Hello fellow MAP! PM if you want to talk.

I have OCD and I just want to clarify something you said. Some people with OCD do get intrusive thoughts about hurting other people, but it is in no way an urge like pedophilia is. In the case of OCD, this thought is a worry: "what if I suddenly become a violent person for no reason and hurt someone", and then the worry consumes them. They never want to hurt anyone, and they never have an urge to. It's the thought that's antagonizing.
No, we aren't 100% in control of our actions. Our understanding of behavior and cognition says otherwise.

Pedophilia is probably as firm a sexual orientation as being gay or straight is. The difference is that pedophilia, when acted on, demonstrably destroys a child's life.

We need to do more to support non-offending pedophiles. They simply can't go through it alone. 

> CBT might help you control your behaviours.

There is zero evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy  will be any use here.
It *was* a throwaway account...
there are many SSRIs that severely decrease libido, but everyone is different. Beyond that i'm unsure of what can be done prescription wise to suppress a desire  
I'm aware of Antipsychotics being used in an attempt to block intrusive thoughts (eg in OCD and Anorexia), though I really do not agree with this practice. In my experience they simply make it feel as though you're thinking through tarmac- everything is drowned out, not just the intrusive thoughts
You can shut down Testosterone with far less invasive, expensive action, if that were the OP's preference.  They both do have ramifications that go quite beyond elimination of sexual desire.  Heck, if only for the fact that if you do not permit Testosterone in your body, you NEED to add estrogen.   Osteoporosis is no joke.
How can you be so cruel and lacking empathy in a mental health group? This is obviously not the place for you, regardless of content. 
Your comment history is disgusting.
Name checks out
Viewing CP gives the industry strength, and shooting those photos and videos of children is damaging and abusive to them. CP is wrong and should not be used at all for any reason.
Okay, I'm not talking about that. For example some new mother's feel the urge to hurt their child and are distressed by it, again, like I said, distinct from OCD but still an intrusive thought. Some people have an actual urge to do harm and are distressed by this. Some people fit your description of intrusive thoughts, some people get more violent. It's not a judgement on your diagnosis, just saying that this person isn't alone in having thoughts they don't want and would rather be rid of.

I'm genuinely sorry if I made you feel generalized.
> No, we aren't 100% in control of our actions.

I'm sorry but I disagree. One cannot control their thoughts or feelings in regard to our sexuality but we can ABSOLUTELY control our sexual behavior unless we are completely and utterly out of touch with reality. It may be difficult and unpleasant as all hell but I believe it can be done.
"Locus of control" is a really interesting topic that is well worth a little research
I agree they need support, which is why I recommended he seek help. But of course he can help himself from following and leering at children, to suggest otherwise is nonsense. 
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. It's certainly better than not trying at all... 
If they could find a good psychiatrist, I'm sure there is something. As with any mental illness- trial and error. Le sigh
Yeah, its not for everyone. Always pros and cons
yes very. For someone who struggles with suicidal tendencies, he should really be more compassionate. I'm baffled 
Okay I understand now. Yes some people have violent urges which are intrusive to them, but I wanted to clarify that in the case of OCD there are intrusive worries but no urges to act on it. Just distress from the thought.
The brain causes behaviors (for the most part). You can't claim you can't control thoughts and then claim you can control behavior. That's not the same thing as saying that being sexually attracted to someone means you are going to stalk them in a grocery store.
[removed]
oh absolutely, it's worth trying different things. 

Of course, everyone is different
And in my experience many pedophiles (not to speak for OP) are extremely distressed by their urges. Like I said, I've talked to upwards of ten people with these urges on /r/suicidewatch so maybe you can see why this thread isn't the best forum to campaign for OCD awareness which I'm totally on board for.
You can choose whether or not to do something. Very simple.

That's a super cool semi-colon; I especially love the irregular, wiggly looking black stroke around everything. 
Such an important project - amazing artwork to promote it!

I'd get this tattooed if I didn't already have one!

Sorry for your loss. Make sure you take care of yourself, as your risk for suicide is increased having lost someone to suicide. Lean on your support system and be kind to yourself. 
I'm so sorry for your loss. 
I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend. It's so hard to go through what would be a happy event with something like that on your mind. Anyways, Happy Birthday. Keep your head up. 
I'm sorry for your loss. Reach out to other friends and family today. 

Happy Birthday. 
The obituary made him sound really happy.  Why'd he do it?
Thats why i have told one person everythjng about me and that way they can put the truth of my mental state in there too.
Thank you. I appreciate it. Leaning right now.
wait, are you planning on doing something that would result in your obit being published?
Idk i guess i just hope someone knows and maybe they would share it. I dont plan on dying anytime soon though. Too many responsibilities and dependants.

Nice drawing. Your jack (pjs?) are pretty neat too.
Love it. Very cartoony.
Nice! I always found art to be very calming when I feel like things are too much. I used to take sketchbooks with me to hospital, too. Out of interest, is the shield a medication tablet? Very cool idea. Best wishes in your recovery :) 
Really cute! (My name is Angie, too.)
[deleted]
I like all the hidden stuff like the ABXY controller keys, the shield that looks like a pill (intended?), etc.
very nice details!
Ohhh the characters are very well drawn and kinda cute. Also, video game, art, and chinese armor and weapons noted.
Thanks. Yeah, they're pjs. 
My first attempt a chibi. I usually do regular anime. 
Yes, the shield is a pill. The sword is a combination of positive thoughts and things that make me happy, and the helmet is a combination of meditation and video games (which are a form of meditation for me). And gauntlets with pencils on them to represent my love of art. 

As for insane Angie, her hair is messy because she doesn't care how she looks, she carries a broadsword of negative thoughts, wears a shirt with a skull on it to represent my obsession with death, and cuts on her wrists. 

In this drawing she has a bit of the upper hand. 
Yes

[Here is the ACLU slamming his mistreatment.](https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/our-criminal-justice-system-failed-jamycheal-mitchell)

Some bits from the BoingBoing article:

>Jamycheal Mitchell had stopped taking his schizophrenia medication before he walked into a 7-Eleven near his family’s Portsmouth, Va., home in April and allegedly stole a Mountain Dew, a Snickers bar and a Zebra Cake totaling $5.05.   
After the 24-year-old’s arrest, a judge ordered him to a state psychiatric hospital to get help. But like an increasing number of the mentally ill, he sat in jail for months as he waited for a bed to open.   
Other inmates said Mitchell paced naked in a cell often covered in his own filth. Family members said they were told he sometimes refused to eat or take medication, and jail records show he manically yelled. He grew gaunt, and by Aug. 19 he was dead, having shed at least 36 pounds. 

>**Family members called the jail repeatedly - about 40 times, Krudys said. They were not allowed to visit him because Mitchell hadn't placed them on a list of visitors, which is pretty hard to do when you are in a severely impaired cognitive state because you're waiting in jail to get urgent medical help for your mental illness.**

T_T. Thank god my country has better mental healthcare :(.
It's a combo of our terrible treatment of the mentally ill and the terrible treatment of those incarcerated. I really hate the belief that many people in the US have that whatever ill treatment a prisoner suffers is their own fault for doing something illegal. 

And here's a city right next to mine featured with news like this. I followed this story when it happened and honestly I wasn't surprised. It's not the first time something like this has happened, mentally ill prisoners held in regular jail cells because there were no hospital beds, hell even just people held in jail for a few days, not even I'm charges, but because they needed to be committed and were waiting for a bed to open up.

I love how concerned the bed looks.
this is funny!
Hah! The Disconcerted Turtle is my favorite.
I am a strong believer in mental health advocacy and reducing the stigma around mental illness.

Coming from a traumatic childhood I have had issues with depression, dissociation, anxiety and PTSD. I freely talk and share my experiences of the past as well as how my mental afflictions impact me to this day.

However, there are two sides of the coin. People with mental health afflictions will have different needs and issues that they are dealing with. They may be less social or anxious in certain situations, things may be triggering to them. 

However, this does not excuse how we should treat other people, or how people should respond to us if we are treating them badly.

We need to make sure that despite the issues that we have, that we still treat others with the same kindness that we would want in return. 

Unexplained rudeness, abruptness, absence, anger or other outbursts can be quite distressing and off putting to the uninitiated/uneducated - it may cause distress to others.

I talk about this more here http://www.zachary-phillips.com/blog/noexcuse

But the point is that whilst we will have requirements that need to be understood, we have to also understand that other people dont know our issues and also may get offended by things that we are unintentionally doing.

I think that the best way to address this is by talking about mental health and sharing resources that best help to explain it.

Thoughts?
If my actions were voluntary, meaning that I actually had control over them, I would agree, but I do not. 

I voluntarily put myself through hell with the medications, electroconvulsive therapy, long and lonesome inpatient stays in order to alleviate the pain of my involuntary actions/inactions against friends, family, and strangers. 

It doesn't always work. I have started to believe that I just drew the shit end of the stick. "Life isn't fair" is an underrated statement, life can completely screw over someone you don't even know by handing them a mental illness and it can affect anyone and everyone within several degrees of separation from the source. 

Give it another 100 years and science will have sorted it all out, but until then, this is what we have to live with. 
I also think think the "excuse" / "no excuse" language is flawed.  A better approach is to accept that we own our actions and their consequences, even if our control over them was compromised.  You then have responsibility to do what you can to achieve control, and to make up for harm you may have caused others.

The language of "excuse" is problematic.
It's one thing when a person is aware of their triggers. Once aware, they are able to at least notice what's happening and get away from whatever it is. It's another thing entirely when a person is unaware of the signs. Anyone with a severe enough illness will likely have experienced times when their actions "aren't their own", or they simoly cannot justify in the context of being voluntary action.

So, a person who has PTSD from sexual abuse should recognize that when the conversation veers in a perverse direction, or when it will pertain to the subject of a colloquium, then they should remove themselves, rather than forcing others to change their lives for the sake of one, or a small group of people.

That being, the conversation needs to be open and shameless. People who don't know unless you tell them. I'm very open about my mental health; and even then, it can catch still people off guard.
I work on an acute care psych ward, and work with patients whose behaviors (directed at themselves or others) makes them temporarily unsafe to be in the community.

During the course of this work, I have been physically assaulted enough times that I have stopped counting (easily over 50). I have sustained two concussions. I have been called pretty much every awful name most people can think of, and several dozen truly, exceptionally creative ones I would have never thought of. Every one of my co-workers, without exception, has experienced verbal, sexual and physical harassment at work at the hands of patients.

I've pressed criminal charges against patients for their actions on 5 occasions.

There are many situations in which a person's mental illness absolutely is an excuse, and a damn good one, for a person's behavior. An acutely psychotic person who punches you because he saw one of the demons clinging to you doesn't deserve blame for their action, to say nothing of rudeness, abruptness, absence or anger.

There are other situations in which a person's behavior is pretty clearly volitional. The antisocial guy with a substance use disorder who punches you because the drink you brought him didn't have enough ice in it definitely deserves blame for his action.

About 99% of cases fall in between these two extremes.

At the very edges of thought, emotion and behavior, it is really, really difficult to tell what behavior is voluntary and what is a result of a person's mental illness. I would respectfully suggest that it is much, much more complicated than you give it credit for.

It definitely shouldn't be an excuse and there's definitely confusion about the difference between abusive behavior and mental illness (both very different from each other) but I also think there needs to be more compassion (and self-compassion) for those who are acting irrationally because of mental illness. I know for me its sometimes not til the next day after having time to eat and sleep that I realize I was behaving in a completely irrational way. 


From my perspective, there's no point in trying to make a person actively experiencing a mental illness behave in a rational way in that moment. You can try to point out the flaws in their logic but mental illness is inherently non-logical so that won't be effective. They'll still feel distressed, and you'll feel like you're talking to a wall. If you wait until they're having a better day then you can mention how you were affected by their behavior. No one wants to make to make their friends and family feel bad, not if they could have done something small to make it better.


I think the most important things to prevent poor behavior are self-awareness of personal stressors and setting boundaries. Note that I didn't say willpower or self-lessness/empathy. Those are often focused on to the point that they seem like the only important factors: if only we "tried harder" or "cared more" then there wouldn't be any acting out. But its more effective to pay attention and be proactive about stressors (even/especially the ones that no one else seems to find stressful) and then not let yourself get so exposed to them that you get worn out by them and don't have any willpower left to fight your demons. That may mean changing your everyday behavior or being upfront with people you trust that you're currently running on empty and don't feel like you can trust yourself right now. You could be determined at that moment use up every ounce of your willpower and sense of empathy and still helplessly fall into a severe episode of mental illness.


Also, abusive behavior is not mental illness. In Lundy's book "Why does he do that: inside the minds of angry and controlling men" is a description of how many codependent women tend to forgive their violent boyfriends/husbands because they think their bursts of rage is due to mental illness, despite having never shown any other symptom of mental illness and not acting that way towards anyone else or even in front of anyone else. Abusive behavior is exploitive, abusers know they can get away with it and on some level they feel the victim is "lesser" so they go ahead and act abusive. Subtle aspects of abusive behavior are even seen as normal in today's world and its not until its violent or extreme that its taken seriously. Anyways, a mentally ill person can change their behavior with coping skills that have worked for them in the past, but they cannot change their behavior upon experiencing more empathy/love for the person in front of them, wanting more willpower, by having different people around them (witnesses/police instead of friends/family) or being in a different context (out in public instead of behind closed doors at home).
As a paranoid schizophrenic I find this situation difficult at best. Even more so because I've lived with mental health issue since the age of 10. I have no baselines of normal reality or thought processes. I have been found incompetent by the government and can't even be given my ssi money. I attacked my brother one time because he was threatening my mom. Apparently that didn't happen, still don't believe that, and was taken to jail. The judge dismissed the charges and sent me to the hospital. I didn't even have community service. Just had to follow through with my mental healthcare and prove it. 

So this is a difficult topic and one that is not to be dealt with in absolutes. 
This is infuriatingly ignorant. The problem is most mentally ill people have a skewed ability of volition.  All you're doing is shaming people for something they can't control.

Chin up! Stop being so depressed and quiet! Hey schizophrenic guy, you know you should get off your ass.  Bipolar girl, stop being such a slut. etc   

Sure, people have to deal with the consequences of any action they do, but this is bullshit.  If you don't want to hangout with someone because they act weird, don't blame them, you're the one wanting to avoid them. 
If the courts can decide that mentally ill people are not criminally responsible for their actions I think we can excuse rude behaviour.
I gotta be honest i've never really understood what it meant to be responsible for your mental illness. For one, I don't hide behind excuses to justify my shitty behavior I'd love to be rid of it. 

If I ever explain why something happened in which I was directly involved, "sorry I was late I lost track of time again." That's my way of processing cause and effect so I can figure out how to get around that. Yeah obviously I was the one who was late but if i'm already trying to change it punishment doesn't motivate me anymore, it just makes me bitter towards the deliverer. 

If it's unintentional, exhibit some self control over that natural impulse to just assume it was a blatant sign of disrespect. Most if not all people who are struggling over and over again are not wanting to, they're brain is actively working against their efforts, so please give them a break with this responsibility talk we're all, mental illness or not, here doing what we can to thrive and find balance. Apologies for the length. "I take full responsibility"
Well, often people misinterpret someone giving an explanation for it being an excuse.

Also if I have no control over some of my actions as a matter of having a mental illness, then it IS an excuse.

That's why people are found "not guilty by reason of mental insanity".

If what you said were true to this extent, then that kind of ruling in a court of law shouldn't exist.
Of course not, but because there is no need to "excuse" because there is no free will. Science has shown as much. Free will is an illusion, it is paranormal and doesn't actually exist. Everything you do is simply cause and effect. There are no choices, there is no free will. There just is.
You not accountable until your aware. However if your behavior negatively impacts other people they do not have an obligation to understand your behavior. So if your a jerk they probably wont like you any more. Sorry but that is the consequneces of your behavior.  E.G I have a habit of reclusive behavior. I tend to push people away, now my friends never call. i have a hard time maintaining relationships because im not aware of their feelings and dont pay attention to important things. now GF is hestitant to marry me, i have hard time staying interested in my jobs, i have had alot of them. Previously i never realized how damaging my bahavior was and still is.  Now that I have been able to recognize my negative behavior I am to compensate with more  positive behavior. However previously i didnt know i was doing what i was doing.  Again i dont expect immediate forgiveness, or acceptance of my actions. However i am more aware of i have hurt people. 
Behavior <i>is</i> the disorder.

They ain't actin' right, git 'em. Toss 'em in the crazy tank. Git 'em outta here.

That's all any of this has ever been.
The first time I ever met someone with PTSD, was a guy who was going to an activity group I was running. He made sure to say, right away, that he was a jerk and always treated people rudely and often yelled and got aggressive. It was okay for him to act this way, though, because he had PTSD.

Knowing little about mental illness at the time​, I just believed him. He proved true to his word. He was unbearable to be around. He was very disruptive in the group and became beligerant frequently. Other members stopped coming because they didn't want to be around him. To keep the group going, I had to ask him to stop coming. He told me that I had no right and that I was discriminating against him. I would hear from his lawyer. 

I never heard from any lawyer. But even if I had, it would not have been a successful case. I wasn't discriminating against him because he had PTSD. I was discriminating against him because he was an asshole. 

There is no part of any PTSD treatment that says, "a person with PTSD should just be allowed to behave in whatever way he wants with no consequences to his actions."

No other treatment guidelines say that either. 

I don't know what mental illness you're dealing with, so this may somehow not apply to your particular situation, and you may be completely out of control of your behavior and require involuntary hospitalization regularly. 

But for the most part, while it is true that people are not not blame for their illness. They are usually 100 percent responsible for their behavior.

Realistically, no one is always perfectly well behaved. The difference is whether, when you hurt someone physically or emotionally, you own up to it and take responsibility for your actions and apologize. Or if you say, "I can't help it, it's my illness, you'll just have to learn to live with my behavior."

It's something that I deal with a lot. I have to help people to change that way of thinking, because it causes a lot of harm on top of the harm already caused by the illness itself. 
I have this issue. When in an episode I have what others call 2 personalities, very nice or royal bitch, I have no real control over what I do or say, the way I explained it to the SSID judge is it's like when in an episode I have no moral compass and am not capable of realizing the ramifications of my actions or words to others or myself. Once I come out of the episode I have no memory of what happened or went on for the duration of the episode. This can be very distressing for me losing time like this and trying to do damage control for things I've done and have no memory of. I've been involuntarily committed due to one that lasted over a month, I just woke up one day in the hospital and had no idea where I was or why I was there. What I thought was my first day was actually my 5th day in. My only recourse is learning to catch these episodes before they get out of hand and start my emergency medication and protocol, which includes at minimum ECT bumped back down to at least once s week and at maximum inpatient, therapy, and a heavy shirt term course of meds to bring me back. They still happen but not as severe as before. We've all, the people around me, have gotten better at recognizing the early warning signs or when the me they know doesn't quite match up to the me they are seeing. Then we start my emergency protocol, assuming I don't refuse it, if refused they must get my medical team and ECT doctor involved and best case scenario they hope to convince me to a voluntary commitment, worst case scenario involuntary commitment. 

I'm working on my voluntary reactions and keep note cards with me at all times to help identify what may be causing the issues and also contain the coping mechanisms for each and medications I need to help me at that moment. It's been a long uphill struggle, but I'm slowly getting better. I'm a difficult case with many mental health issues that converge upon themselves. I'm a ticking time bomb sometimes. The judge I met with for SSDI, my medical history, hospital records, ECT records my testimony, and the own courts expert vocation witness convinced the judge at the time I am completely impaired with no hope of getting nor keeping a job. I have hopes of one day putting myself back together fully or if not possible mostly and to one day again be a fully functional member of society. I have a long road to go, but I just want to be able to work in my chosen profession once again, to be able to support myself and not depend on others, to not hear my son (whom I lost custody of) say he doesn't like visiting anymore because I'm always sad, angry, sick....and we never go anywhere anymore. That right there is my biggest reason that I work so hard to find me again. I don't know what it was that completely shattered me two years ago as I've had these mental health issues since I was 15, but I hope to one day soon be the parent my kids grew up with and knew they could always count on. 

The whole point of this drag on response was to share and let you know I understand. Our illness comes with distinct issues on behavior and accountability. If you need someone to chat with feel free, I'm here for all of yall.
I completely agree. A person living with paranoid schizophrenia is often unable to tell the difference between the actual truth and what they mistakenly perceive to be the truth. 

If I were to strongly believe that someone was in danger, and I had to act to protect that person, then I would probably act.

There is a difference though. You are fully aware that you have a severe mental health disorder which causes you to believe things that aren't real. You would be well served to get into the habit of reality testing events that upset you. Ask and choose to believe a trusted person in your life who isn't affected by psychosis, or [try some of these other ideas.](http://recoveryfromschizophrenia.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/How-can-we-tell-whether-our-suspicious-thoughts-are-justified.doc). 

I know it's difficult, but the more you do it, the easier it gets and the better you get at it. I've seen people make incredible changes in their lives using these techniques. The minute you accept that your paranoid thoughts and beliefs are caused by psychosis, you're already on the path to recovery. You just have to start taking steps. 


Maybe more in the way of, "sorry I caused you to miss out on X, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?"    The focus not being on "why", as that's where you get into excuse land, and doesn't serve anyone; but rather "what" and an effort to move forward.

Just my take on it.

You're still accountable even if you're not aware. No one else can be. That may not seem fair, but it is true. 
Let's say I get easily angered, due to a mental illness, and decide to punch a Barista who is being slow with my coffee. 

Is it fair for the police to take me away? Or do they just tell the barista, It's okay, he has a mental illness. We just let them attack people, because it's not their fault that they have mental illness. 

Things aren't as simple as you seem to think. 
If there's people that don't feel able to control their behaviour, what coping strategies could they use?
Yep, a fist to the face sound like his cure. I have ptsd to the point that even a knock at the door makes me scream in startlement! This guy on the other hand is just self approving his behavior.
I knew a guy like this. He used his pain as an excuse to treat others like crap. 

He would blame god for not miraculously healing him but he didn't learn the lesson of pain for if he had he would not have inflicted it on others with such impunity.
I have PTSD combined with some kind of nebulous mood disorder that isn't diagnosed yet (keeps changing, no psychiatrists on my health care within 100 miles of me that are accepting, waiting is taking forever...). So I'll chime in here with an example.

I will be doing dishes with headphones on. My wife comes home. Puts her hand on my shoulder gently. My heart rate doubles. I can't control myself. My hands shake, arms are fully extended downward, face gets contorted all weird, breathing becomes rapid and short, and I turned around instantly and sternly told her not to sneak up on me like that, that it freaked me the fuck out, and to leave me alone for a sec.

That's an example of one of my triggers, being surprised or snuck up on. My reaction was basically involuntary. The only reason it wasn't as bad as it used to be 10 years ago (which would have been yelling at the person and cussing a lot more) is because I've been struggling my way through therapy and learned a lot of hard lessons.

Another example is another trigger I have which are contentious arguments with pretty much anyone. I kinda switch off all empathy when this happens, as a defense mechanism, and try to destroy the argument anyway I can, even if I make it personal and hurtful. I had to do this to defend myself from my abusive PTSD-suffering Aspergers father in intellectual debates. It's the only thing I know really. I've been slowly getting better by a lot of therapy.

I always tell my wife she would have hated me 10 years ago.

But was I 100% responsible for my actions 10 years ago? Or were the complications of being young, fresh out of an abusive childhood, slammed into adult life, etc... having some kind of effect on me that made me lack control?

I think the "100 percent responsible" line is both philosophically vacuous and not supported by research in this area. It's also not supported by how we treat criminals according to the law when it comes to sentencing (not guilty by reason of mental insanity as one example). It's also not supported by all the psychologists and psychiatrists I've talked to over the 25 or so years I've been in and out of the system.

I think it's too black and white, and usually when people speak in absolutes like that, there's a whole lot of nuance they are ignorant of.
You're right, it doesn't apply to my situation. The definition of the word "involuntary" is key here. 
I had a therapist help with these things. I'm aware of them now and only when severely psychotic do I really lose touch. But at that point I probably need to be in the hospital. I have my specific techniques, Inception style, and a trusted source who has no reason to lie. These things have helped tremendously. I still lack understanding and live with constant perception issues, but I'm not attacking people and I'm helping myself more. 
At times what looks like fully aware to you and us us not so true. It can get quite muddled with schizophrenia. There are plenty of times while in an episode I seem fully aware of my actions and what I say, but once I'm brought back from said episode I have no memory of what the other me's did or said. I've gotten myself into some bad spots and done things that would land me in prison while in an episode only to come back down with no memory but my notes while in it, my bank record, my Facebook, the reports that I've given doctors while in one, and the reports of the people around me. That is beyond scary to know such things. I have no reasoning of right or wrong, good or bad while in an episode. The very words from my doctors mouth who have interviewed me extensively while in various episodes. The other me's just don't understand that or have the concept of morality. I don't k ow if this rambling made sense, but I hope it opened your eyes a little. Even while aware that we have these issues of not being able to tell if things are really happening or not, everything is so real even while questioning oneself of the validity of the occurrence at the time still yields the same result. This is one of the few areas of mental health where it's incredibly hard to take responsibility for your actions as everything in you is telling you what your experiencing is 100% real. No mater what is provided to tell you otherwise you just can't believe it.
Well not accountable to yourself. Society of course.  How can you fix it? im just scratching the surface of my bull shit... i will probably be dead before fix all my negativea. 
The whole mental illness paradigm is a sham, currently.

Today, anyone who feels any way, or fails to feel any other way, is diagnosable with something.

But the label is used to shoo people away who aren't hurting anyone. 
There are plenty of strategies to help one with behavior they know is wrong, see themselves doing it, yet feels compelled to do so even knowing the ramifications. One very good one, generic as it sounds, is meditation, talk therapy to deal with things behind or to do with the particular illness, actively keeping in mind that their behavior in a situation while possibly justifiable is not understood by the others around them, a support team of friends and family who will call you out in a prearranged way of the bad behavior, and behavior modification treatment plans with an educated, successful, competent, and willing to tailor a program just for you and your needs psychotherapist or psychiatrist. There is also the option when knowing you are going into a situation that may trigger certain emotions, responses, and behaviors in you is to just walk away and make a call or text to one of your support team who can help, offer guidance, and possibly talk you down or through it. 

With proper education, information, honesty, and hard work one can improve sectors of their life affected by mental illness. I think that is even possible for me and I have multiple issues to include schizophrenia that is composed of episodes with other me's and no knowledge of them once I come out of it. So what do I do? I educate myself and those around me, work to learn early warning signs, lead a healthy lifestyle that I know helps to prevent or to not accelerate an episode, journaling to catch what may be missed, staying a compliant patient with plenty of talking with my various doctors so we have a United front, try my best to undo any damage while in an episode, and when caught early enough do everything in my power to prevent it from progressing. I check in with my support team when one says they see early warning signs to confirm it's being seen by others. It is a lot of work, but it is doing something. I have enough books to fill a psychiatry practice. I read, do work books, and learn. Education of yourself and others is the biggest tool one can carry in regards to their medical issues, no matter the scope or variety.

End rant
You are confusing "at fault" with "responsible".

Yes, you were responsible for your actions 10 years ago. Meaning that you were the person who had to bear the consequences of them. 

Because you are responsible for your behavior you chose to engage in treatment to change your behavior. This improved your behavior. 

If you're not 100% responsible for your behavior, then who is responsible for the part that you refuse to take responsibility for? 

In the moment, you may not be able to control your behavior, but when that moment is over and you're back in control, does it become your wife's  responsibility to manage your behavior and deal with the consequences? Do you simply shrug it off? "Not my problem. Deal with it!" Do you just ignore the fact that you snapped at your spouse or do you apologize? Or is it her fault for not considering your PTSD when he attempted to communicate with you? 

I am usually the one telling people about not speaking in absolutes. But a person's personal responsibility is their own. Of course there are exceptions when a person is literally not in control of their behavior and is cognitively incapable of understanding their responsibility. But that isn't what you're describing.


Perception is my biggest enemy. I try to relate to the person or group how I perceive what's been done or said. Then we will go back and forth until all parties understand each other and their points or reasoning behind an action. That doesn't work in large groups of unknown people, but right now I don't go "out" alone. This I've found to be my best ammunition with perception issues whether it's someone else or me just not knowing how to clearly state what's in my head. I'm very blunt person of little words at times and found out the hard way people perceived what I said, how I said it, or the very bluntness of to be not understandable or threatening. It's a slow learning process,  but the people around me most now firmly understand my brain works different. I perceive many things completely opposite of what they say. I hope this coping mechanism will help others. 
>Yes, you were responsible for your actions 10 years ago. Meaning that you were the person who had to bear the consequences of them.

100%? No. My father is partially responsible, his father is responsible as well. I'm also partially responsible. The societal system in the US where getting proper mental health treatment was exceedingly difficult is partially responsible. The psychologist I had that betrayed my trust leading me to never seeing a psychologist again for 10 years, is partially responsible for the ongoing problems.

I don't accept 100% responsibility because that will be beating myself up over things that aren't 100% my fault.

You can beat yourself up all you want, I prefer to be realistic and accept that the times when I've been out of control are because of the environment I was raised in, and my life experiences. Also brain chemistry, very likely. And then there is some responsibility.

I have improved over the years sure, and THAT is my responsibility. But when I lose control, that necessarily implies a lack of agency.

I think your terms are messed up, and your view is not nuanced enough.

I think taking 100% responsibility for things I do that are out of my control, is self-harm.

Ok first off - Grade 12 and using terms like lethargy is great. You obviously put in a lot of work on this project as well.  Here are my comments:

1. Do you have your citations/references listed on the reverse?  Comments like SAD can lead to Bi-Polar are pretty huge and need to be cited.

2. The formatting in the bottom right corner where words are split with hyphens. Try and have the complete words. It will make match the rest with a clear/clean look.

Edit: Specifically the words balanced and moderate.  Anti-depressants looks fine the way it is.
Looks good! I have some suggestions

- if you got the thing with bipolar from the sad wikipedia article, it's meant the other way around. 25% of sad patients are bipolar following a seasonal pattern. but as far as i know there is no special danger that sad can "evolve" into bipolar.

- serotonin is a neurotransmitter, not a hormone

- darkness does not trigger the production of melatonin, but light inhibits its production. the result is the same, but the difference is important

- if it has to be scientifically correct, i'd leave out narcolepsy, it is a different illness. just write daytime sleepiness/fatigue/exhaustion

- in terms of feelings i'd include hopelessness and in more severe cases complete absence of feelings (apathy)

- maybe separate the bulletpoints for antidepressants and "Psychotherapy (e.g. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)" look out for the typo

- sad lamp therapy is usually called light therapy

hope that helps!
This is pretty great! Good job!
Wow, this looks really good! I love the hand drawn look of it. 
I don't have any suggestions as far as changes, but I think that it looks adorable and the colors are very clean-looking! :)
I think it looks pretty good and I would agree with previous posts about small fixes, I think the only thing that I would do is "define" SAD. Your heading calls it Seasonal Affective Disorder and then the first sub heading calls it SAD. If you have space maybe write Facts about Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Minor detail that I keep getting in trouble for in my college essays.. :/

Thanks for the feedback! I will definitely list my references on the back of the poster and I actually just fixed the hyphenated words as it was irritating me.

Thank you! 

edit: This poster was actually just for an English class so I don't think it has to be too scientifically correct.. although I will fix some of your recommendations! I appreciate the feedback. 
I totally agree with rv29, and he is correct in all of his points. 

The word positioning and color scheme are awesome! It looks fantastic, it just needs some content tweaks. 

Very impressive from someone in grade 12. 
Thank you! 
Thanks so much! 
Thank you! :D
Oh, good point! Thank you 
Thanks! The tweaks shall be made.
I'd love to see it after you've edited it :)
Will you repost the new one? I want to see it! 

As someone who has suffered from depression, and has had asthma, not sure the analogy completely holds - but I appreciate the sentiment.

The sad part is that most standard CBT based treatment is basically saying "quit thinking negatively", and while it works for a little while, it doesn't really address the underlying issues - the messages we learn that keep us trapped and stuck in our heads.  We technically have plenty to be depressed about - or we wouldn't be.  Sometimes we only need to be depressed because our brains have learned it's the only way we'll pay attention to ourselves, and so it overuses that tool, but that's completely okay and valid also.  I am also aware of MDD (major depression) which has physiological components, but those are being more and better understood every day - including living an anti-inflammatory life, getting plenty of exercise, and really learning how to be proactive with self-care.  

Anyway, just wanted to share.  There are things that can be done about depression.  Depression makes us not want to do those things.  Doing them anyway is a big deal step, so... there it is - whatever this comment is :-)
So I think this is important. I got hit by a car today. Nothing really serious, just a sprained AC joint, but still I got hit by a car. And yet I couldn't stop thinking what a great day it was. My depression has been pretty well in check, and I realized, EVERYTHING is better than depression. And it's shitty because when I was depressed, if I said I was depressed, I tend to get less people who give half a shit than saying I got hit by a car, even if I emphasize the minor nature of the accident. But depression is a shitload worse than being hit by a goddamn car. And I think most people don't realize that. And I'm not saying depression needs boatloads of sympathy, but I am saying that people need to take it seriously. Hopefully this gives someone a little bit of perspective. Maybe it's because the extraordinary circumstance of being hit by a car catches your attention and because depression seems so nebulous and seems so hard to distinguish from just being sad, but less people think you're okay when you get hit by a car than when you're depressed. And I can say from my own experience that I am unequivocally less okay when I'm depressed than I am after I went head over heels thanks to a careless driver.

TL;DR I got hit by a car. Getting hit by a car is better than depression.
It's extremely frustrating for people to blow off depression because they think "we all get depressed sometimes." A stereotypical car accident seems like a near death experience to people, but they don't realize that many with depression are also near death, and more often than one instance.
[deleted]
I was also hit by a car about a decade ago. Had a concussion and left hair spiderwebs in the windshield, still better than depression. 

I got into a head on collision last year and the amount of sympathy was nothing short of astounding. How ironic that I'd been on the edge of death for years, and some crushed up metal was all it took for them to finally notice.
I can relate. I fell off a cliff once, and let me tell you it might be the best thing to ever happen to me. I'm not trying to one up you or anything. But man, my experience, being in the middle of the woods bleeding from the bone marrow of my jaw, fading pulse, going into shock as the rescue team arrived to get me out of there, it gave me something.

I have some mild bouts of depression, usually lasting a month or two with about three months of pretty regular life in between. It used to be far worse. I've only experienced a couple of weeks of severe depression in my life, but a good portion of my life has been filled with dull colors and numbness. I've learned my routine to keep it from getting worse and not ruining relationships like it has in the past. A good workout, getting sun(tough on nightshift), cleaning, etc. But even then, it's tough to make yourself do that when you don't even want to get out of bed. Since my near death, I feel like I was gifted life by the universe, God, or whatever.

All I know is that day almost a year ago could have easily been my last. And all I have to do is think about how the fact that my face was put back together almost seamlessly, how I managed to get out without any substantial brain damage, and just that I'm alive and I realize that not living my life to its full potential would be a disservice to the paramedics, rescue team, andy best friends who were there to save me. And how hard I fought to stay alive then must mean life is worth living. It gives me that motivation to throw off the sheets and live another day. Sorry for the rambling. I thought you might relate and just got carried away.

Anyway, OP, I love you. Have yourself some more awesome days.
Depression is without a doubt the closest to death I've ever been. I can understand why it's harder to see than a car accident. But it's the real deal.
I often had the desire to jump into oncoming traffic. Something about the idea of a sudden impact, a defining moment, and then change, whether it's death or hospitalization or just a chance to relinquish a little bit of the weight of living is terrible but appealing. It's disconcerting to feel that way, like something must be so wrong that catastrophe is a better option.

The funny thing is, I finally did get hit on a day when I had no desire to. Be careful what you wish for, I suppose.

I'm sorry to hear that you felt the need to take that step, and glad to hear that you can be grateful that you survived. I wish you the best as you keep living this beautiful life, even if it's hard to see that beauty sometimes.
Funny how that works. There's spectacle to a car accident, and we all love a good spectacle. Depression is about the furthest thing from spectacular. It's scary and most people don't seem to want to be close to it.

I hope you're doing well with your depression and that you can find people who can give you support in a meaningful way. Best wishes.
Thanks for sharing! Life is a gift, from whatever it is you believe in, whether it's God or chance or nature or your mother. Sometimes a near death experience helps you see that. 

Sometimes it's not a bolt of lightning, but a process. I know it's always been something I have to work on to remember that even if I'm not here for some divine purpose, I have the opportunity to live a wonderful life if I choose to do so.

I love you too, keep living like it's worth it!
it comes back again that's the bad part, it comes back and visits
sounds similar to mine, I often want to ruin something that seems really really nice. shiny things I have some sort of ocd to just break them. I'm sort of mistake prone like this. I want things to be perfect yet I want to break them. 
Thanks, I hope you're doing well too. And this is definitely true. Car accidents are dramatic, obvious, noticeable. But depression is so deeply personal and easy to hide. No wonder it's so easy for people to shrug off and ignore... Still, very sad that so many people struggle in silence.
You seem grounded man. That's the most important thing to get through the rough days.

This was spot on.
Well, it is about right, but coming from someone who was pinned with mental illness, i think people have a point, physicsl illness ir worse amd soemtimes looking on the bright side is all that is needed.
People should not treat "mental illness" labels like actual physical illness.  The term "mental illness" is just a label for alleged behaviors/feelings.

Dude, shut the fuck up. You have no idea what you're talking about and you look like a moron.

I was absolutely ravaged by depression for years, until it was discovered that I have sleep apnea. Treating that treated my depression, as one could imagine when you're essentially sleep deprived for years on end. I tried all solutions imaginable to fix it before that, including your bullshit about identifying life's problems or whatnot. The only thing that worked was treating it as an illness and going at the root cause.

Of course mental illness is illness. Anyone saying otherwise is ignorant as fuck. The sources you are linking to are talking about something completely different, namely that mental disorders aren't very well identified and the symptoms can be similar but belong to different root causes and need different treatment. Sometimes the identifications we make are based on wrong things, and that's a problem. The solution to that is getting better at identifying and treating mental illnesses, and certainly not just thinking it's not an issue. Neither Insel or Frances would *ever* argue that mental illness is not real or not as harmful as physical illness.
So because diagnoses are based on symptoms and we invented the concept of mental disorder to label those symptomatic clusters, you think mental disorders don't exist? This is pedantism at its worst.
This is downright dehumanizing, what you're saying. I've been diagnosed with bipolar. And let me tell you, it's as real as any chronic disease. In fact, it can only be treated effectively by medication like and chronic physical illness!

Have diabetes? Take insulin every day for the rest of your life and change your diet. Have bipolar? Take lithium every day for the rest of your life and watch your diet. 

How is that treatment not like a physical illness? I didn't develop this due to stressors. I developed it from genetics. My maternal aunt and maternal grandfather both had the disease. Go fuck yourself.
Do you have a better idea?  Or is being contrarian your solution?
Are you here to troll? If not you can find a wide array of quotes to support any viewpoint.

Relying on quotations for your argument is what a fucking Year 9/Grade 9 student does for their English essays. There is significant scientific consensus in regards to mental illness. 

Here is a statistic for you: 45% of all suicides in the US in 2008 were the result of mental illness.
> I was absolutely ravaged by depression

I didn't say the emotion of depression wasn't real.  I said moral opinions of which behaviors/feelings are good or bad ('healthy' or 'mental illness') are not evidence that such is an illness.

It's fine to take drugs if you're depressed.  But if you want to be honest then you should admit they're drugs & not pretend they're "medicine".

The same is true for sleep problems.

> Of course mental illness is illness. Anyone saying otherwise is ignorant as fuck.

That's not an argument- that's circular reasoning.  ("My assertion is true because I assert it's true.")

> Neither Insel or Frances would ever argue that mental illness is not real 

Frances said, in the quote you ignored, that all "mental illnesses" are "made up" "constructs", & "psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests."

He's saying "mental illnesses" only exist as made up constructs/labels.

- "Mental disorders don't really live ‘out there’ waiting to be explained. *They are constructs we have made up* - and often not very compelling ones."

> So because diagnoses are based on symptoms 

Already you're asserting without argument.  (Circular reasoning.) Aka, "an assertion is true because I assert it's true."

When you say there's "diagnosis" and "symptoms" you are asserting that behaviors/feelings which you morally think are bad are "mental illnesses."

You made no argument for that.


> dehumanizing

You have it backwards.  It's psychiatrists who are dehumanizing people with their insanity/"mentally ill" language.  Some people are accused of things & assumed guilty with no due process- no evidence/conviction.  They're forcefully kidnapped, forcefully drugged via beatings, suffocation, & tied up like wild animals.  All while being assumed essentially subhuman-- "mentally ill".

The fact that some people enjoy their victim status labels is irrelevant.

>  I've been diagnosed with bipolar.

Here's reality:

- "The British Psychological Society released a statement claiming that there is no scientific validity to diagnostic labels such as schizophrenia **and bipolar disorder.**"

http://guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2013/may/20/mental-illnesses-depression-pms-culturally-determined    

> Have diabetes? 

That's a physically measurable disease.  A real/physical disease has physically measurable damage or loss of function.  ie physical units of measurement & thus accuracy/repeatability.

>  I developed it from genetics. 

There's absolutely no evidence of that.  And even if accusations of "bipolar" were linked to genes that is not evidence that any of the alleged behaviors/feelings are an illness.




There's many betters ideas than "mental illness" mythology.

1. One solution (for some people) is drugs.  ie buying & using drugs without pretending they're "medicine" for some imaginary "mind illness."

2. Another solution is to identify people's real life problems (eg systems of oppression) and try to solve those problems.  This is obviously better than assuming the individual to blame.

> Relying on quotations for your argument is what a fucking Year 

You've made no argument that the statements by the former director of the NIMH or chairman in charge of creating the DSM-IV are false.

>  There is significant scientific consensus

Incorrect.  The people who assume behaviors/feelings they morally dislike are physical "illnesses" (and not labels/constructs for alleged behaviors/feelings) are not actual scientists.

> Here is a statistic for you: 45% of all suicides in the US in 2008 were the result of mental illness.

It's a fake pseudo-scientific "statistic."

Really you're using circular reasoning.  You're asserting "mental illness" is an illness (not a label for alleged behaviors/feelings) without argument.  ie, you assert it's true because you assert it's true.


That you rely on subjective judgment does not make something not an illness. Even today that's how most things are diagnosed, including serious conditions like appendicitis. I guess that's just a construct too? Something we could look on as morally okay in a certain view? After all, dying of sepsis is an acceptable fate?

You're taking things you have no fucking clue about, extrapolating them into some idiotic point, and running with it. *Of course* mental illness is subjectively tested – we don't have the means to diagnose them otherwise. That makes them no less real, no less than any other disease that we were not able to diagnose until recently. With your logic, a bacterial infection wasn't real until the 1700s.

I don't know why I'm spending time on you, given that you're an idiot, but whatever. I would almost hope some mental illness befalls you one day so you can eat your words, but I'm not that kind of person. You should reconsider your utter ignorance, though.
> Circular reasoning.) Aka, "an assertion is true because I assert it's true."

You know you are doing the same thing, right? 

Anything that disrupts the body's homeostasis can be a disorder, illness, or a disease.

Do you think fibromyalgia, lupus, or chronic fatigue syndrome is fake too? Because they are all diagnosis based on exclusion, similarly to how mental illness is diagnosed. Does it mean it doesn't exist or that the people experiencing life disrupting symptoms are just faking it for... what? Drugs? Attention? Out of laziness?
imaginary?

[Blood test to diagnose depression in adults](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140917121229.htm)
The brain is a god-damn organ you neo-Marxist hack. ALL organs can malfunction, for many, many clinical reasons. That's not to say environment doesn't factor, it clearly does, but there's no reason AT ALL for someone to assume the brain (and therefor the mind) is immune to illness. You're making an assumption based on zero precedent. 

The reason defining, diagnosing, recognizing and treating mental illness is so difficult is because the brain is the most complicated human organ. People are complicated. Contrary to your blank-slate Marxist bull-honkey, every person is physically unique. Many past and present factors make them who they are. The science is also quite new. 

But keep telling people they aren't sick, like you know. 
Many forms of Mental illness are a chemical problem in the person's brain and completely testable. Google CT scans of brains of people suffering from mental illness.

Seriously do you use [this](http://imgur.com/a/QDbyt#12) before you even comment, holy shit. 
> That you rely on subjective judgment does not make something not an illness. 

You're the one saying something exists- you have the burden or proof to prove it, not the skeptic.

This is the [exact same debate we atheists have with religious fundies.](http://img0.joyreactor.com/pics/post/funny-pictures-auto-comics-logic-371546.jpeg)

> Even today that's how most things are diagnosed

Wrong.  For physically measurable damage/*loss of function* sometimes a person guesses before a physical diagnosis is made to verify such.  That's not the same as psychiatry where there is no physical diagnosis & it's 100% subjective moral opinion.


> That makes them no less real, no less than any other disease that we were not able to diagnose until recently.

You're confused.  I hear this a lot- that some "future science" will prove psychiatric claims.

Really future technology *can't* prove "mental illness" theories because they're based on moral subjective opinions:

- Declaring that behaviors (or feelings) are "illnesses" is making a moral judgement that they are bad.

  eg, no one would try to claim "hard work" or "heterosexual porn" was a mental illness because they view them morally as good.

And that- making moral judgements about various behaviors/feelings -is out of the realm of science.

**Example:** the "mental illness" called ["transvestic fetishism."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvestic_fetishism)  
This is the idea that it's fine to masturbate to straight porn (or all sorts of other types,) but that masturbating to transsexual porn is a mental illness.

Such a moral opinion *can not* be proven by future science.  




> You know you are doing the same thing, right? 

Wrong.  1) I make arguments for my assertions, and 2) *I don't need to because I am the skeptic.*

- The burden of proof is the person who says something exists.

- The skeptic only has to point out there is no evidence for the assertion.

You still have made no argument that behaviors/feelings which you morally dislike are "mental illnesses."  eg, assuming there is a "homoestasis" which is "disrupted" when you make a moral judgement about a behavior/feeling is not an argument.

> Does it mean it doesn't exist

Behaviors/feelings exist, which you may not like, but they are not illnesses.  The term "mental condition" is fairer.  Happiness is a mental condition, so is depression, etc.

> lupis

That's a real/physical illness.  A real illness has physically measurable damage or physical loss of function.  ie physical units of measurement & thus accuracy/repeatability.

> chronic fatigue syndrome

This feeling *could* be because of a physical illness.  It itself is not an illness.  As for accusations of pain without a physical diagnosis:

If someone is *claiming* pain (without any physically measured illness) you should trust them & sell them the drugs they want.  In a free society (which I advocate) you should own your body & be able to buy whatever drugs you want.    

Obviously a *claim* of pain could be faked- it's not a physical measurement.  But you shouldn't assume someone is lying.   

 - "Some members of the medical community do not consider fibromyalgia a disease because of a lack of abnormalities on physical examination and the absence of objective diagnostic tests.[142][149] Yunus has referred to some physicians' belief that FM is psychological in nature as disturbed physician syndrome (DPS): "It is the physicians who are psychologically disturbed because they ignore the data, and whatever data there is, they manipulate it to say what they want it to say."[150]"   
  
-- wiki     




> [the "genetic link" to behavior myth.]

It's irrational to say:

- "I linked a behavior to a gene, therefore that behavior is an illness."

This is true for any other claim for a "link" between something physical and a behavior/feeling.

**Example:**

Imagine we all had bad vision & thus couldn't see that one person was "hispanic" & the other was "white."   

We could link the genetics of the hispanic person to various behaviors. (And vice versa.)

*ie, linking a physical thing to a behavior.*  

**Q.** Does that prove the behavior is an illness? 

**A.** No.   


> The brain is a god-damn organ 

I didn't say otherwise.  I explained that no behavior (or misbehavior) or feeling is an illness.

You apparently believe this:

 - "If I morally dislike an alleged behavior/feeling then it's an illness."

You have made no argument that any behavior, "misbehavior", or emotion/feeling is an illness.

To assert such without argument is circular reasoning.  (ie "I believe X is true because I assert X is true.")

> is because the brain is the most complicated human organ.

Here you're trying to say "it's too complex for us to understand now, but some *future* science will prove mental illness theories."

That's wrong: Really future technology *can't* prove "mental illness" theories because they're based on moral subjective opinions:

- Declaring that behaviors (or feelings) are "illnesses" is making a moral judgement that they are bad.

  eg, no one would try to claim "hard work" or "heterosexual porn" was a mental illness because they view them morally as good.

And that- making moral judgements about various behaviors/feelings -is out of the realm of science.

This is the idea that it's fine to masturbate to straight porn (or all sorts of other types,) but that masturbating to transsexual porn is a mental illness.

Such a moral opinion *can not* be proven by future science.

That assertion is completely unproven.   

 - "In truth, the ‘chemical imbalance' notion was always a kind of urban legend - never a theory seriously propounded"   

-- psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/couch-crisis/psychiatry%E2%80%99s-new-brain-mind-and-legend-%E2%80%9Cchemical-imbalance%E2%80%9D    

> [brain scans]

When brain scans show one person is different than another that difference is not proof that anyone's brain is "ill," inferior, or flawed.    

Different != a disease.

Plus, the truth is "mental illness" is a moral concept.  ie, declaring that a behavior/"misbehavior" (or feeling) is a "mental illness" is making a moral judgement that it's bad.

And brain scans can not prove people's moral opinions, such as which behaviors/feelings are good or bad.

In contrast, real diseases have physically measurable damage, physically  measurable loss of function, etc.  
> [emotion]

- None of that is an argument that I'm wrong.  

- The drugs could be current "prescription" drugs or something else (eg weed, lsd, etc.)  Whatever makes a person feel better.

  It doesn't matter whether state drug cartels have declared a drug "legal" or not. 

The drugs purchased do not "treat" some imaginary "mind illness."  They help people change their emotions and/or behaviors.


> [no argument that I'm wrong.]

You haven't made any logical arguments for anything.  And for data to be scientific it must come from a scientific source (with physical repeatable experiments, ie physical units of measurement, & thus accuracy/repeatability.)

Just asserting there's "mind illness" is not that.  And just asserting that suicide is linked to such "mind illness" doesn't count either.
*All that ad hominem is making your comments look even worse, you should avoid using it (Silly_Camel).

I never thought I'd meet a sophist so rigid they doubted the concept of homeostasis before.
Do you read your so called sources or just pull them out of a hat?
Logical fallacies. Straw-manning. Nobody even brought up morality you troll. And you are the only one assuming that mental illness are exclusively about behavior, moral or otherwise. 

Someone with OCD ringing their hands and picking their skin is NOT in a healthy state of mind. Neither is a schizophrenic hearing voices, seeing ghosts and talking to walls. Neither is a down syndrome sufferer throwing a fit, bashing their head against a wall and smearing themselves with feces. 

If you admit that the brain is an organ and can malfunction or improperly develop then guess what, you admit mental illness exists! Every organ in the body has a specific purpose, and when it deviates from that purpose it's called ill. 

Does that mean it isn't hard to determine what is and isn't mental illness? No! The brain is complex and poorly understood, the science is young, and your conspiracy theory nonsense isn't moving things forward in the least. 
Why don't you link to something that is an actual reference. Something peer reviewed? Actually published in some kind of medical journal?  This is some random website you could could write.
Did you seriously just say "imaginary mind illness". You've got to be a troll.
Make no mistake, I don't think you're correct or justified by any stretch of the imagination.  However, I'm not so naive to think that a stranger on the internet is going to convince you otherwise.  I'm just looking for clarification of your stance.  Quite frankly, I find your points rather misguided, especially considering my own personal experiences and the experiences shared by many people on this subreddit.  
> [no arguments that I'm wrong.]

Talking about me personally (personal attacks) is *also* not an argument that I'm wrong.
You're dishonestly twisting my words.  I didn't say there was no homeostasis anywhere in the universe, I said you were:

- "assuming there is a 'homoestasis' which is 'disrupted' when you make a moral judgement about a behavior/feeling"

Please improve your reading/comprehension.
> Nobody even brought up morality 

The fact that psychiatrists don't admit they're making moral judgement isn't an argument for they aren't.  Really declaring behaviors/feelings as "mental illness" is making a moral judgement that they're bad.

>  a schizophrenic hearing voices,

**The Guardian:**   

- "The British Psychological Society released a statement claiming that there is no scientific validity to diagnostic labels such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."     

http://guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2013/may/20/mental-illnesses-depression-pms-culturally-determined    

**NY TIMES:**

 - "[BPS]... released a remarkable document entitled “Understanding Psychosis and Schizophrenia.” Its authors say that hearing voices and feeling paranoid are common experiences, and are often a reaction to trauma, abuse or deprivation: “Calling them symptoms of mental illness, psychosis or schizophrenia is only one way of thinking about them, with advantages and disadvantages.”   

  The report says that there is no strict dividing line between psychosis and normal experience: “Some people find it useful to think of themselves as having an illness. Others prefer to think of their problems as, for example, an aspect of their personality which sometimes gets them into trouble but which they would not want to be without.”     

  The report adds that antipsychotic medications are sometimes helpful, but that “there is no evidence that it corrects an underlying biological abnormality.” It then warns about the risk of taking these drugs for years.    

-- http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/opinion/sunday/t-m-luhrmann-redefining-mental-illness.html

Basically, you hear language (assertions) that there are people out there "hallucinating images" and "hearing voices."  It's the psychiatric & drug industries which have decided to describe a wide variety of people using that language.

And then tell people to use that language, so then their "patients" will use it.  This (just like people claiming they "hear the voice of god") is proof that the language used by the various industries is accurately what the alleged "patients" are feeling or describing.

Next, the fact that you morally dislike an alleged behavior/feeling is not evidence that it's a "mental illness."

> Someone with OCD

There isn't such a thing.
>  you could could right. 

I don't "right"/write the psychiatrictimes.  And there is no scientific psychiatric journal since psychiatry itself is a moral violent industry, not a science, and it isn't medicine.

What would you call it when "behaviors and feelings" start interfering with your daily living and lead you to hurt yourself/someone else?
>  when "behaviors and feelings" start interfering with your daily living 

That's vaguespeak & subjective opinion.

> and lead you to hurt yourself/someone else?

That's vaguespeak & subjective opinion.  

"Hurt someone else" could mean almost anything.  When you say "hurt someone else" you don't specifically mean (for example) someone convicted via camera evidence of attacking someone.

I'll entertain your vaguespeak and subjectivity....

How about something specific then; what would you call: someone who is suicidal and decides to jump in front of freeway/highway traffic in attempt to kill themselves, in the process hurting others when they get hit by a driver or two before anyone can come to a stop.

An interesting article. Psychotic breaks are the worst. I'm glad she was able to come out of her's and still have the love of her husband. 

Treatment of such a disorder is interesting. I'm more of a mind with the husband, no games, take the pills. But I have schizophrenia, and a bad sort of it. I suppose for some a diagnosis is difficult, sometimes even impossible. And patients, that are in control of themselves, should have a say in what they will and will not do. Very eye opening.
Wow. What a great article.  Folks need to understand that our brains are fragile and this could be any one of us who needs support for ourselves and our loved ones.
Love the mad map idea! Great article
The Icarus Project is a great resource. It has helped me understand my own madness and has helped me so so much to reach out and offer hope to others who are in simliar situations. If you are thinking of doing so, I really encourage you to make a mad map. Show it to the people you love. Alot in my life has changed for the better since I made a mad map and shared it with my partner and my housemates.
"mad map" sounds like the same thing as the "wellness recovery action plan (wrap)" that my therapist had me work on.

Here's a useful link in that same vein: /r/schizoaffective/wiki/wellness
This is a really nice, but truthfully heartbreaking article. I hope they manage to find the balance and be happy.
What a beautifully written and candid piece.

Also signing in to say how good the mad map idea sounds.
I have not been diagnosed with any mental illness (not that there has ever been an attempt to do so), but I believe that a person should have a say in their own treatment. I didn't think this was possible either, because a mentally ill person during their illness can't always be trusted to make the best decisions, but I never thought about how this could be done in a way it would work: the idea of "mad maps" or well, plans for the future, sound like a pretty good idea. Lay out certain types of conditions and what should or shouldn't be done.

One of my greatest fears in the world is control over my own life being taken away from me, eg involuntary commitment. I fear this way more than anything else, even death. I understand that I could be held if I threatened the safety of others - that's what the police is there for as well, but I cannot accept it if I were a danger to myself, because after all, it is my life. Nobody should have the right to make those decisions against my will. However, we live in a world where that's a very real possibility and it turns out this system is even abused.

Being forced to take pills is another thing that seems scary to me.

Them feels man. Healing kitties are the best kind of kitties.
That's not surprising. First of all having an animal to take care of has been proven to be beneficial to all types of people who are going through thinks. It gives you a sense of love and of being needed. Also, cats themselves are great because their purrs have magical powers. Ok that is a bit of an exaggeration but the purr has been show to help relieve stress and stimulate healing so, I call them magical purrs. I'm glad you have found a friend to help you.
I think it's actually pretty simple. He's your friend, and being with friends is good for you. I miss having a cat so much.
The nice thing is you don't need to try and explain, we understand. When it comes to pets it's usually "who saved who". My roommate had an all black cat that helped me through a tough time and we were inseparable until he moved abruptly. Still miss the spastic bastard.
No surprise, not only is he cute and fluffy, but it has been proven that having pets can help with mental health.
Makes perfect sense to me - http://img2.wfrcdn.com/lf/50/hash/15872/4908697/1/Artehouse-LLC-My-Therapist-Has-Whiskers-Planked-Textual-Art-Plaque.jpg
Making a commitment to be there to take care of a cat is possible for me when making a commitment to stay alive isn't. Staying alive in order to care for the cat is just a side effect. 
I don't know what I would do w/o my dogs.  I rescued a young cat 1 month ago.  He was stuck on a ledge by a river close to my house.  He is a trip.  Naughty and comical as hell.  He goes in the litter box and lets me know when to clean it (A type personality this guy.)  your cat is beautiful.  He/she has a calm vibe energy.  I wish you many years of happiness.
nice pussy

I'm sorry to hear that you had a relapse. From what I know, BDP may be one of the most difficult of the mental illnesses for others to understand. Keep up with the journal, your medication, and doctor appointments. You may have relapses, yes, but I have confidence that you can be successful! Being self-aware of the problems is one of the most important steps. 
BPD is shitty. I have it too. One of the most important things to remember is that when you do 'relapse' (I call it having an episode) that doesn't mean you haven't made progress. Like having a couple slices of pizza doesn't mean that you haven't made progress with eating healthier - you just have to get back on the wagon. 

Good on you for making notes and attempts to get back on the wagon. Try not to make overly ambitious goals, though. Sometimes just taking a shower and avoiding knives is the most you can do in a day.

As for relationships, I ended a LTR almost a year ago and have made such amazing progress on my mental and physical health since then. I've casually dated, but have avoided serious relationships. As you know, BPD tends to worsen when in relationships, so maybe make a pact with yourself not to jump into anything new until you've done all of the necessary work on yourself. 

I wouldn't say I've made a full recovery, but I've made a LOT of progress. PM if you want to talk(:
FYI Mormonism will only make you feel guilt and shame about having a mental health issue. 
Remember to use your mistakes as education tools. That is something people rarely do, preferring to punish themselves or avoid thinking about them. Pick them apart and see what went wrong and what went right. Then try to correct the behavior if similar situations arise. 
Look into DBT. I thought i had the diagnosis four years ago but was in denial and didnt pursue treatment. 4 years if hell later ive come to terms with it. DBT is the treatment that is most effective.  Make sure it is a legitimate group and maybe find an individual therapist that can work through some of the material with you. Also message me if you have any questions or need a friend :) I just went through a breakup too bc of some borderline shit I did and it hurts like hell not to have them
Good shit. I'm proud of you. 
I'm sorry that your SO left you, that must be very painful and confusing for you.  I am sure you cared about them.

It's very hard to treat BPD alone, simply because the pain of loneliness can overwhelm you and once overwhelmed it's hard to think rationally.  BPD is a bit like being lost in a sea of emotion, the feelings just keep flooding you until all that you're doing is fighting against being drowned.

I don't know what resources you have but a good listener is essential, and the best book I've read on the topic is "Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder".
The do not text thing... I have a genius solution to that. Make them so angry, scared, pitying that they refuse to talk to me again... No matter how much I beg... Conversely I now realise why she never liked messaging me again, she didn't want her past coming back to haunt her, we were both pretty bad... Kinda my childhood morbid infatuation aha, we were good friends however.

(Even if you think the world will end if you don't make contact with whomever you currently know you shouldn't, trust me it never makes you feel better, makes things so much worse, something tells me you know this, just I know it is a challenge to remember, Aha).

I like your plan it is very future orientated, not about fixing things or trying to change mistakes, it is simply a plan of how you can make things better for yourself, it is really good! Got a back up plan when you have a bad day and disregard the plan? That's when things will be testing... You currently in therapy in medication... You go to that and you should keep to the plan.

I understand that it must be really tough, tough being an understatement and under explained haha. But I wish you the best of luck! :)
If the following statement resonates with your experience, you see yourself in at least stage three of the [five stages of therapeutic recovery](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-five-stages-of-recovery.html), and you want to get out of the trap it feels like you're in, reply to this message. (You're welcome to look over my posts elsewhere on reddit to assure yourself that I'm not repping for some guru or psych hospital, of course.)

"If one was regularly ignored, abandoned, discounted, disclaimed, and rejected -- as well as invalidated, confused, betrayed, insulted, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, ridiculed, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, dumped on, bullied, scapegoated, and/or otherwise abused -- by others upon whom they depended for survival in early life, and/or they are highly stressed by school, work, relationships or other chronic life challenges, they may have been programmed, conditioned, socialized and/or normalized to conflicting beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be, and then beat themselves and/or others up for not being able to meet their conflicting expectations and requirements."

If you don't mind me asking, does it help? I'm newly diagnosed too and am having trouble with coping mechanisms and other things like that. 

Yup. This needs to be said more often, because the very students who need to hear this the most are the ones who are most resistant to listening to this. To them (to my younger self) prioritizing anything else over grades is blasphemy. Its a sacrilegious idea that won't sink in the first few times you hear it.


But once you've lost your physical/mental health sometimes you cant get it back. Trading health for a gpa isn't a good deal.
I've struggled quite a bit with high school though this year I'm redoing my last year. The year before I was in hospital and the school nurses room a lot. 
After 4 1/2 years of daily use. 
Congratulations my friend! That's no walk in the park! What are you going to do to celebrate? 

BIG high five. So *many* with severe anxiety fell into [the trap Ed Khantzian described](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=Khantzian+self-medication+hypothesis) years ago. And some of them actually did it *with*... medications. 
Congratulations! That's quite an accomplishment! 
This is some courage right there.

This person is an emotional and a moral giant.
Congrats! What helped you to remain benzo free? 
Congratulations!! Can I ask which benzo and how you accomplished this? 
Go you! That's an incredible feat!
Awesome! I'm proud of you : )
Yo, what benzo were you on? How much were you doing daily?

Nice accomplishment kicking that stuff.
Go you! You are awesome!  Stay strong and keep moving forward, making new memories! :)
Congrats on sticking to your sobriety!
Thank you so much!!
Get a good night's rest poison-free :) 
Probably one of the harder accomplishments to make in (my) life! Thanks so much. 
Merely the overwhelming fear that is experiencing withdrawal and rebound anxiety again. That alone is not worth the risk of even taking half a pill. 
There was one night after tapering which I can only describe as the most excruciating mental and physical experience—
followed by 2 months of consistent insomnia.
Thanks so much!
It was Klonopin (clonazepam). On this day one year ago, I did not think I was capable of breaking my dependence on benzos. I thought it was helping me enough, I thought it would be too hard to do, and again I thought it was helping me. 
There were a couple situations in the last year where I experienced increased withdrawal symptoms after tapering or going too long without. It was terrifying to recognize and feel how dependent my body and brain actually was to just 1mg daily.. not even "abuse". 

Long story short— I tapered and ended up in the emergency room one night because of the most excruciating mental and physical withdrawal, or "rebound anxiety". 
I begged for benzos just to ease it and the doctors would not give me any. I'm glad they didn't. They broke a cycle I probably still would have continued today. 

And one of the main reasons I haven't touched one since is  merely because of the ONE experience in the hospital.. it was enough to never want to risk feeling that kind of torture again. God forbid 
Thanks so much!
I was on klonopin (clonazepam) 1mg daily, sometimes 2-3 mg daily for the last 2 years I was on it.
Toward the end I realized I was just continuing it to prevent withdrawal symptoms.. Which is the worst experience. 
Thanks so much, it means a lot! 
Thank you so much!
This isn't the typical MH post, but for those of you who also suffer with mental health disorders, and have debated on getting a pet, I say go for it. I got my cat in July after being in the hospital and someone mentioned an ESA animal to me. I kind of sat there like "WTF is that?" Then they explained it to me, I talked to my therapist and she smiled and helped me fill out some paper work for my landlord. Then I found her [= She is the only reason I'm still here. She is my best friend I can tell her my secrets
And she just listens while laying my chest looking at me, and sometimes she licks my nose. She also needs me to survive. It helps knowing that I'm needed. Everytime my car pulls up when I get home from work she jumps in the window and stares out and runs to the door when I put the key in the lock. Meowing and climbing all over me as I sit on the floor. I rescued her from a shelter, but I wish she knew how she rescued me. 
This is such a lovely post. Thank you for sharing :) 
Thinking hard of getting one (or two, for company to each other) of these furballs. Would boost my mood quite a lot, since I'm very much a cat person. Problem is, my life is in a flux phase right now and I may be moving to another city at least once in the near future. Guess I have to wait since the moving would probably be difficult for the cats. Sigh.
Thanks for posting this. I have several mental health issues and in addition to owning two cats, also volunteer for a cat shelter. Like you, my cats are my best friends and make me feel loved and useful. When I'm having a bad spell, my cats know and will do things like curl up next to me, 'ask' to be picked up or lick me. They are far more affectionate companions than people generally give them credit for. 
I'd like to think that everyone would benefit from having a pet but unfortunately shelter work teaches you that there are some irresponsible people out there :-(
Am so glad you and your feline friend have each other :-)
I'm so very happy to read this kind of post. I'm a cat person myself so I totally understand what you said. A feline company is very comforting. It isn't rare for me to cry on bed for stupid reasons but my cat would climb to my bed, knead and purr on top of me and it's a really pleasant feeling. So I second that.
I can relate, but mine is a dog. 
This post made me remember how much I miss having a cat in my life. He passed away suddenly last year. I play a lot of League of Legends, and over the past year it's pretty much been a downward spiral of negativity and constant tilt/emotional tension. I miss having the little bugger around to shove my face into, instant relaxation. 
Yes yes yes! ESAs: petsare very helpful. I have two cats and a dog.i feel so much better.
So happy to see all the positive comments. <3 Wishing you all well.
Moving isn't too bad for cats if you plan it well and reduce panic and rushing. Maybe get them used to traveling short journeys first. Leaving the carriers out at random times with treats and their favorite blankets are good. 
Moving is inevitable for many people, and complete stability with home and work may never happen, or not for many years. In my line of work I don't even know whether I'll have to move country several times in the future, but I couldn't get by without my pets. I just made sure they were set up with all the international microchips and paperwork from when we got them, just in case. It's worth it.
Cats are very adaptive little creatures. Don't let the fact you may move hold you back! Also I drove three hours to get my cat from a shelter. She thought the car ride was pretty cool after a half hour or so. Stared out the window and napped the whole way home. 
Thanks for the perspective, I need to think about this some more. Having one or two adorable little pawmonsters around would very likely improve my quality of life so much.

I am so glad this issue is being addressed. Good on Kate.
Hopefully her voice will lend weight to taking this matter of childhood mental health more seriously. 
A good friend of mine took her life this week, it has still barely even set in, it probably won't until the funeral. She was reaching out to be loved, and had her heart broken by a POS who took advantage of her loneliness and her kindness. 

I suffer from PTSD, Social and Relational Anxiety, and Depression, and this girl saved my life by being there for me, showing me the love I needed. She had a way of lighting up the world when everything felt dark. 

I'll be honest, I loved her so much. I viewed her as so far above me, deserving better than a broken mess like me, even when she was always open to the idea of an "us," planning dates that never happened due to one of us always ending up in a relationship, I still thought she deserved better than me, and obviously she did. I was a coward for my fear. 

I hate to dwell on what might have been if I had the courage, if I had been there. Maybe it wouldn't have made a difference at all, maybe it would have. 

(Edit: I accidentally hit send before I was finished)

If you love someone, tell them. If you are hurting, tell someone. If you know someone is hurting, reach out. You never know if or when someone has hit their limit, and you'll be left to wonder what might have been. 
I'm so sorry for your loss. This is great advice. Tell your loved ones as often as you can. Friends and family.  It feels good to hear it. 
Thank you for saying this. I've been suicidal for almost two months now and it's been getting continually worse. The only reason why I keep going is my best friend who I've loved for seven years, I'd hate to leave him here all alone.

My adult son started complaining that he hated every one and every thing, on facebook.  He then stepped it up and started saying he was done with life.  I moved quick to convince him to come live with me.  Now he is cared for and getting the help and love he needs.  He was completely overwhelmed by his problems and needs a lot of support, but I am happy to help because I love him. 
Please don't, he needs you, but more importantly, you need you. Your story is an on going saga that sits in your hands. A life without purpose is hard to live, so give yourself purpose. I mentioned mine in another comment, that I'll do all the things I've wanted to do, travel, eat, love. When you have a goal, or purpose to work for, the will to live is easier to find. 
While there's literally zero I can do to stop you, I can tell you, no matter the circumstances, taking your life isn't the solution. Things can feel so hopeless one day, they can feel like the absolute pit of despair, but then you experience a moment where all of a sudden your pains, your hurts, feel insignificant compared to the joy you feel. 

Depression is a fickle beast. Go do something, show yourself the world. Emery has this song call "I never got to see the West Coast" and it is all about the regrets we have for not accomplishing what we wanted, and feeling like we never will, because we see this moment as the end. But the song ends with the line "but if you're by your self you should know, one day we gotta see the West Coast." 

I have decided I will not die until I have accomplished all that I want to do. I will see the world. I will find a love I deserve. I will eat foods a Sicily, Mexico City, Bangkok. I will sky dive. Anything I want out of life, it's my goal to work towards it. It gives me the move to keep going, to keep breathing. Will it bring me happiness? Who knows, will I be broke? Probably. But when I go, I can take only the memories of the things I got to experience. 

Give your self something to live for, and leave a story to be told for the ages. 
do you have any good friends you can talk to or hang out with? an animal? 

know that you are so much more than whatever you're going through. people are going to miss you so so so much.... look up the suicide hotline in your area and please give them a call.... 

sending my love, support, and hugs. xoxo 

Those sound like great options. I don't have enough money for any of them though. 

I kind of disagree that suicide is never the solution. My brother killed himself. He was schizophrenic and must have felt like that was the only way out. I respect that.

My grandfather killed himself. His wife had died and he felt incredibly lonely. That was a solution. 

“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.” - David Foster Wallace

I know it's a metaphor but I've lived on the West Coast my whole life. I've never seen the East Coast but I don't much care to. 
Believe me, I understand being broke. It takes little steps, but you can't run a marathon without those first steps. It's nothing I'll be able to do tomorrow, but that's the point of it, working towards a purpose 
I can't believe how expensive it is. $180 for every visit weekly. That's not even counting the gas and metro fees it takes me because my therapist is over an hour away in the city, and having to take off work every Thursday. 

But it is helping, and I do need it. Without therapy I would be in a much darker place than I am now. I am seeing the improvement and it is worth it.

My rent is $550 a month, but my therapy is $720 a month. My parents pay most of these appointments- at the end of each month we send the statement to my insurance and half of that is sometimes compensated. Ridiculous.

I'm just ranting. It's so unfair how little insurance does to cover mental healthcare when it is a very real, necessary, and effective part of people's wellness. God damn
If it gets to be unbearably expensive, you can probably find someplace on a sliding scale. In fact, the place you go might offer a sliding scale.
Look at it this way: your rent allows you to live in a home, your therapy allows you to live in your head!
Hey there. Yes, those figures are indeed scary :\

Hugs, hope things become better for you soon! :)
That's some truly awful health insurance. Your current insurance might be one with low premiums meant for healthy people who don't expect to need more than an annual checkup or coverage for freak accidents. A plan with higher premiums but $30 copays would save you money. You might want to look into what options you have for switching insurance.
I wish rent was $550/mo where I live...
Why i dont go to therapy :p Its impossible for those paycheck tobbq paycheck
$180 sounds awfully high. I've never seen a therapist in the US, but my ex was seeing a very good one who was only $100 a session, even before she got on the sliding scale. I live in the UK now, where even private healthcare costs pennies compared to the US. Right now I'm not even on the sliding scale and my therapist is only dinging me £50 a session, so, about $60.
Check to see if there are any community therapy centers in your area. I know there is one by me. The therapists are typically volunteers that run sessions between $2-$55 (based on income.) Hope you are able to find something affordable. I may be exhausting to go through the entire process with a different therapist, but it could help you in the long run. 
come to germany. Refugees welcome.
Man, I hear you: Individual + group therapy: $160/wk (~$740/mnth) Psychiatrist: $160/mnth Meds: ~$200/mnth =$1,100 a month! Plus I pay $200 a month for towards old hospital bills.

My insurance is high deductible so they don't cover anything until after I hit $5,000. My therapy and psych don't bill insurance so I have to do that myself. Only after I submit those claims and hit my $5k do I get reimbursed but only 80%.

My law school student loan payments+car payment+all other bills except mortgage don't cost as much as my mental health care. Like you, its totally worth it to me but yeah...God damn.

Where do you live?  (EDIT: Oh, I read more comments.  You live in D.C.)  That is higher than standard rates, anywhere I've lived/worked.

What are the therapist's credentials, and what treatment modality is he using with you, primarily?

I strongly suggest discussing this with the therapist, and requesting a lower rate - or locating more reasonable rates elsewhere.
I hear you man. I quit therapy because of cost.
What is a sliding scale? I've heard someone say this before I can't remember..
Wow, as someone who has been putting off seeking a therapist this really resonated. Thank you. 
Haha I lucked out I actually live near DC where things are pretty stupid expensive
Yeah.  Not really.  My therapist now charges 300$.  I believe he's the best trauma therapist in the country - or one of them.  He's also booked to capacity right now.  $180 is high for someone that hasn't looked beyond insurance recommended therapists - but there's a whole different world out there.  I'm not meaning that as a slight, but really a good therapist can accomplish in 3-4 sessions what it takes another good (but not the same category) therapist a year.
My ex was on ESA in the UK and was paying £70/week on psychology sessions. The costs were crippling. In Australia you can see private psychologists for free if you get a referral from your doctor or you can see them through the public system for free as well and there are short waiting lists. And we have high minimum wages and most people earn much more than the minimum wage. People waiting to see a psychologist for severe mental health issues in the UK may be waiting for years to see a NHS psychologist and some end up dying in the process (suicide ETC). Even £50/session isn't affordable for many people in the U.K., nor is US$60. 
Yeah I don't know what to tell you, I've seen other therapists in the past nobody has been below 110, the one I have now is a great match for me because of his experience with treatment resistant problems so I don't intend to switch to save money
there's no shame in asking again. a sliding scale is when the service provider (in this case, your therapist) adjusts the service costs based on your income. if you make between (some amount of money) and (other amount), your therapy will cost (this much.) it will cost less based on whether your monthly income is less or more.
Whoa that's awesome. I live in the middle of no where and apartments are $850 and up a month. I'd rather live near D.C. 
I've seen £70 in the UK but it's about the highest I've seen, and I live in a large, expensive city, with top rate (mental) healthcare. It's definitely not super affordable to a lot of people in the UK, but I've never seen a private UK therapist that doesn't have a sliding scale. I'm right there with you on the NHS psychological/psychiatric care though. It's piss poor.
IMO, paying for something that you are satisfied with is worth it. $180 is a lot but on the East Coast it (DC-New York) it is not at all atypical (Plus part of what you are paying for is that experience that you want) .

Yes, it will likely be possible to find therapy cheaper but there are other concerns with that (the most pressing of which is getting in/ dealing with a waitlist). 

If the therapist mentioned sliding scale to start with it's a thing the therapist does, so bringing it up might not be a bad idea.

Admittedly, I might be biased as I also am a therapist. 
Haha apartments are way more. I rent a room in someone's townhouse and I'm about 45 min south of DC.
Unfortunately the psychologist my ex saw charged £70 even though she was considered to be too mentally unwell to work...she wouldn't budge on the price even though she knew we were very poor and couldn't afford it. I went without a lot just so we could afford it. I didn't but conditioner for my hair even though the cheapest stuff was only £2 because we needed it for food or petrol. It was a nightmare 
My ex's therapist was in RI, (so East Coast), and connected with Brown University and Butler Hospital, so pretty seriously qualified. But yeah, in NY $180 for a therapist doesn't sound atypical. Then again rent is 2 or 3x what op is paying a month in NY, even if you have room mates.

EDIT: I just remembered she was 24-25 when she was seeing this therapist, so she was still on her folks insurance. Not sure if it was a $100 copayment or $100 without insurance coverage.


I hadn't heard of this artist, Shawn Coss, or seen his work before so I search him and found several [here](http://www.boredpanda.com/for-inktober-i-focused-on-mental-illness-and-disorders/?page_numb=2) for anyone interested.

I enjoyed the images, specifically the ones I can 'relate' to. It's eerie to see your experiences depicted so accurately in a drawing, and sort of comforting to know you aren't alone in this. There were a few that didn't quite "fit" for me, but I'm sure others will find it to be quite accurate for their own experiences.
For anyone whose curious, the artwork is by artist Shawn Coss. His Borderline One is amazing. 
I don't prefer Shawn Coss's work with mental illness. I find it quite offensive and stigmatizing and I am sick of neurotypical people trying to describe or illustrate what these illnesses are like when they have no clue. 
a lot of his work is in a very similar creepy, dark style, you can find him on deviantart

i like this a lot!
He did a whole month of disorders. This October he is doing phobias. I can't wait! 
nice, never knew about this guy until now, will probably share with some of my friends :D

Good on him for speaking out about it.
I love it when a celebrity opens up and doesn't care what other people think
He's a good guy. I like him.

People just love to hate this guy because he's so popular (and that "anti-semite" controversy)
no sympathy for a Nazi fuckhead like this one. find a better person to look up to about openness for mental health, not this fucking reactionary.
I really don't think I'd want him to be the face of mental health at all.

edit: yep downvotes. I'm the one in the wrong for not giving a fuck what a racist has to say. lol. 
Pewdiepie will literally jump on any train to get followers. He is a narcissist to the point where he doesn't have one original thought in his head. He paid for his followers and he lies constantly. There is no clear story for how he came to be on YouTube and every video I've seen him make is fake. This is not helpful for mental health. Depression and suicide is not some trophy for disaffected teens to carry around as a beacon of individuality. People are dying. 
He isn't a nazi.
Did you even know him before hand? Or did you just listen to The wall street journal and believe everything you were told?
You're still stuck in 2016 then? He's not racist
You're the one wrong for being wrong. Simple. Do some research, he isn't racist. People thought that after one incident until things were cleared up. 
He's not racist 😂
Damn, somebody was reading the articles a bit too much without actually watching the videos that the articles were talking about.
 > Pewdiepie will literally jump on any train to get followers.

"Train"? He is one of the only people doing this, the rest being small channels.

> He paid for his followers and he lies constantly.

In what way? If you really want to, you can see his slow and eventual growth to 50mil subs, he didn't buy shit.

> There is no clear story for how he came to be on YouTube and every video I've seen him make is fake.

He admitted that a couple of years ago some of the comedy was kinda forced and not really him being himself but he has said multiple times that he is happily being himself and not "fake".

> This is not helpful for mental health.

Well this spreads awareness to a large audience, is awareness a bad thing all of a sudden?

> Depression and suicide is not some trophy for disaffected teens to carry around as a beacon of individuality. 

Let me know the part in the video where he says those words so I can understand what you are talking about.
Okay and what are you fucking doing about it?
I'm not going to repeat what the previous reply says but

"People are dying"

Yes, and Felix stated that suicide is one of the highest causes of death in males.

"He will literally jump on any train to get followers"

Literally nothing on that video suggests that it is about mental health. Nothing. It's just a picture of him and "important message" as the title.
When I saw this in his uploads yesterday, I had no idea that the video was about mental health.


I recommend that you actually get to know Felix instead of judging him by all of the FAKE articles and bullshit that is constantly spread about him by the media. If you actually did some research beforehand then you'd know that Felix actually raised money for a mental health charity a few months ago. Funny how the articles never report on that though isn't it??
The biggest people get the most lies made about them. Look at Michael Jackson as an example. And sadly people like you fall for it.
You have literally no idea what you're talking about.

It really is amazing what going for a walk out side, even alone, can do for your state of mind. No it won't cure depression but the walk will often make your brain release chemicals that will help you feel better for at least a short time. Maybe long enough to take a shower and cook a meal when you get home and just maybe that leads to feeling able to do the laundry for the first time in weeks. One step is all it takes and pokemon go gives you a reason to take that step that is different from every one ,including yourself, nagging at you to "do something". This is not nagging its just fun.
I volunteer for Crisis Text Line and in our weekly newsletter today, it was mentioning how we're seeing a spike of people mentioning PokemonGO as a coping skill. It's so awesome to see!!!
Makes me really wish I had a phone. 
Check out /r/NoContract. I think freedom pop even offers a free service. 

Hello again! A good post, though I think it might be a good exercise for you to go into a little more depth on each of the topics, rather than simply summarizing the literature you received. Still, this is a good start.

>You gave me all of these exams and no tools to deal with the amount of pressure being put on me by all of my teachers, and the letter that I was going to be catergorised into. You insisted on telling me that if I failed my exams, I wouldn't get anywhere, and at the end of year 11, you defined me with 13 letters, Well done!

As I mentioned in my comments to your previous post, I am starting school this September to study teaching and become a high school teacher in Canada. This particular comment resonated with me, because I have experienced it several times. A warning: *it gets worse through university*, unless you take steps to educate yourself and learn how to handle the stress. Now, if mental health and effective stress management was taught as part of the curriculum starting at, say, grade 4 or 5, I think this would be much less of an issue. In such a case we would have much less need for basic mental health *awareness* groups in universities, but instead could have full support groups helping to educate those who need it and provide facilities and resources to the rest. This is a stretch, I know. But I hope that when I become a teacher I can be a part of getting things on the right track.

Your point about parents is also correct. Most parents have had the exact same mental health education as you. That is, *minimal if any at all*. Expecting mental health education to come only from home is unrealistic. Yes there will be out me parents who are up to it, but there will be many more who just done understand and don't care to learn. It is absolutely a responsibility of schools to teach mental health and stress management. If this were to start at an early age, say grade 4 or 5 as mentioned above, we would have generations of children becoming adults with a healthy understanding of themselves, their emotions, and their stressors. This will go a long way to help them interact with people as adults in professional and casual environments alike.

Just a note about your page: the background image is somewhat distracting when trying to read. If you could fade it by about 50% I think that would help.
It should be taught in schools, but more importantly, we should stop deliberately giving kids mental illness in the first place. 
Thanks for the warning about university. Thankfully I'm hoping to avoid that route. I think that schools should begin teaching mental health at the age of about 7. It would cause less problems higher up in school that way.
Thanks for the note about my background. It has been noted and the background has been improved.
^^^^^^ THIS!!!!!!
I don't know that that's quite fair. It is simply not the case that school boards/districts are out to deliberately saddle children with mental illness. Curricula are in a constant state of review-revise-implement, and there is always something that falls through the cracks.

The frustrating thing is that mental health and mental illness has consistently been on the short bus, as it were. For all the psychologists at work coming up with new educational standards, one would think that something like mental health would be high on the priority list. What we need is to teach students (a) what emotions are at a base level (no, I don't mean at the level or neurotransmitters and chemical reactions), (b) that it is okay to *feel*, (c) that nobody other than yourself has control over your emotions - nobody has the power to "make you feel bad"; only you can do that, (d) what it means to talk about your emotions, (e) what is meant by the term "stress", (f) how to recognize and manage stress.

All of this needs to begin at around age 6 or 7. Expecting parents to teach this material on their own is unrealistic, as a majority of parents are just as deficient in the same areas. However, that's not to say they should be let off the hook. If children can be taught to recognize and regulate their emotions and stress, I think the American epidemic of school shootings would dissipate and (possibly) disappear.
I'm glad to see you are interested in these issues, and I am always happy to engage in discussion regarding them. As I mentioned in my longer reply above, it might be beneficial (for yourself and others) if you were to expand a bit on each of these topics. Rather than just going from the report you picked up (which is excellent work, by the way), use it as a jumping off point for further discussion. Perhaps you could write a series of posts expanding the discussion of each point in your original piece,  but using material from other sources as well. Just a thought - I just would like to see you explore the area a little more, and develop your writing skills at the same time :)
Eh, I mean, they're not intentionally creating it, but that's only because they're ignorant of the causes. Much of what they do can directly cause mental illness, but they (are choosing to) remain ignorant to the damage they cause, so they don't actually do anything about it.

There's a serious problem when children are being given the same workload of full grown adults, but that's what we're doing in high school and middle school, and some elementary schools too. There's a much, MUCH bigger problem when kids are being routinely assaulted and can't ask for help.

Also, you can absolutely make other people feel bad. It's not even difficult. What are you talking about. Emotions are something that you do not control. At all. You can control how you act, but not how you feel. 
That would be pretty cool. I know what you mean about using the entire and did read through the whole thing. I picked out the bits I thought would be most relevant to school. Lots of it was relevant to CAHMS, but I wasn't really sure how to use the information. 
I think I may do that, and delve into each of the ideas individually.
>Also, you can absolutely make other people feel bad. It's not even difficult. What are you talking about. Emotions are something that you do not control. At all. You can control how you act, but not how you feel. 

This thinking is a product of poor psychological education. If you think that you *cannot* control your own emotions then I feel sorry for you. Most people believe this because they either don't believe that emotions are significant or important, or they don't understand how to manage their own.

I do not give anybody the power to *make* me feel anything. You do not control how I feel -- that's all me. If children are taught how to do this from an early age then we will have a society of empathic people who consider the needs of others and understand that their actions affect other people. As it stands now, we have a society of people who think they are the most important things in the world, having little to no consideration for others, screw anything else.
Sweety, we can consistently induce depression in animals to study it. We can consistently instill phobias in people, though we've since decided (correctly) that it's unethical to do so. Emotion is absolutely possible to influence from the outside. You don't exist in a vacuum. 

There are things one can learn to help manage emotion. Learning to depend less on other people's opinion of you, for example. But humans are hardwired to have specific reactions to specific stimuli, and the extremity of the reaction is the most one can control.

Unless, of course, you start doing something really maladaptive. Like associating traditionally negative things (like abuse, death, etc) with positive emotions. But we qualify such maladaptions as mental illness for good reason. It's far more useful to solve problems than to convince people that they should just not be as upset about the problem in the first place.
Yes. I agree that depression, anxiety, and other illnesses can be induced in people. What I'm really trying to get at is that teaching children at an early age how to manage their own emotions, helping them to develop an empathic sense, and ensuring they know they can talk about it with parents, teachers, counsellors, etc, is so very important. 

No, nobody lives in a vacuum (that would be inadvisable). A few years ago I inflicted some damage on myself by conducting a very bad social experiment. I decided that instead of always being the one to initiate conversation or activity, I would wait for others to do so. However, this was perceived by others as giving the cold shoulder, and resulted in me feeling more and more depressed. Big surprise! I sought counselling shortly after, but I'm sure it cost me a couple good friendships. Everything we do affects someone else. This is most obvious when driving, but can be identified in situations as I just described.

Now, I'm not saying that everyone automatically by default has control over their emotions - sorry I didn't mention that earlier. But it can (and I feel should) be learned, and is easiest when starting from a young age.

One definition of a psychopath is someone who lacks empathy. Those are the people who start associating death, dismemberment, abuse, and torture with positive emotions. That often cannot be helped. But if emotional intelligence was taught an early age, many such would be identified and possibly treated, or maybe managed.

And I am certainly not saying that I have perfect control over my emotions. I am far from perfect. Yes, other people affect me, but I am able to recognize when that is happening and put things back in perspective. I choose not to give others control over my emotions. 

Your doodle is beautiful, just like you!!! 

I need to send this to my entire family.
I hate when you finally tell someone you're diagnosed with depression/anxiety and they ask what makes you sad or anxious.

The chemicals in my brain......constantly and consistently.
> it is not a failing of character.

such an important takeaway and something I always struggle to remember. thanks for posting this! 
Hi friends,

**If you are feeling well**, and centered, and in a stable place, and want to support some of our fellow subreddit members, **please come out of lurking**. Many people feel emotional stress during holidays, new year, winter, etc. and this week I'm seeing more than usual posts. We have 22,000 members if you are in a good place, please share a supportive word or helpful resource with your fellow human by reaching out in the subreddit. 

Currently I am experiencing a bit of mental and emotional fatigue so I know how that feels and I do not want anyone to over extend themselves, so **if you are experiencing burn out, don't worry about it and please take the time you need** for your beautiful and valuable self to heal. **Please don't feel guilty or obligated** to post comments if you just need to lurk and read while you recover. 

A great big **THANK YOU to you all** for being supportive, encouraging, empathetic, and all around awesome!

The TL;DR is in bold :)
As one of the not so well centered or stable, I'd like to thank all you mods who keep these related subreddits up and running.  I've really been able to work down a lot of my paranoia towards mental health care, reach out a bit to the professionals who've honestly always been there waiting, and am in a much safer place now than I was a year ago as a result.

 I will try my best! I would love to support everyone, but I myself struggle. When I am having a good moment I will help! 
I really needed to hear this as someone who is now doing a hell of a lot better lately - thank you for reminding me how important it is to help others!! 
Hey you, reading this. Yes you. Thank you for being you. 
My emotionally manipulative and abusive mother: "Are you wasting time on Reddit again?"
Me: "I'm not wasting time, I'm trying to help people by replying to their posts."
Mother: "Why don't you help yourself and your family first?"
Me: ".......Wanna make a post about your problems on Reddit?"
Thank you for this post. It can be easy for me to go into lurking mode sometimes, especially when I'm feeling better. I will try to be more active. 

I just want to say thanks /u/simmaltree for the great work you do on the sub. Myself and many others really do appreciate it. 
I'm not doing very well right now. I joined Reddit in part to look for happy little things in the moment. I always try to keep moving forward. I think I posted here a couple of times in the last 2 months but my memory is off at times. Still I promise I will post more in the future. And I generally do try to post something hopeful and from experience. 

For now I will say three things to everyone in this subreddit - offered with humility and only ever with compassion and love: 

1) you're likely here because you want to feel better and that is the most important decision. We didn't choose to feel so crappy, but we can choose  to try and feel better
2)  you're not alone. Hopefully you have some friends and family who try to understand your pain and who support you. If you don't, or if that is not enough, you have others around you who know what it is like to go through most days suffering from mental illness ...in this subreddit.  So reach out and tell us what is going on: ask for help or offer a word of support if you can
3) you are very brave. Dealing with mental illness requires incredible bravery. If you are brave enough to deal with your illness and share insights about your situation or to help others then you are doing something compassionate and heroic. Please don't wait for someone else to be that hero. We have to raise ourselves up together

Reach higher in 2017, and see if you can touch a star.

XOO to all
I've been dealing with alot of burnout in the last few months but I'll give it another go again on this subreddit for a bit. Thanks for the heads up /u/simmaltree 
I am guilty of not responding until a posts pops up on the front page. My resolution is to be of more help. I primarily use a phone for Reddit, but will make a conscious effort to utilize the laptop on the sub.
I've been having pretty severe panic attacks ever since thanksgiving disrupted my work routine... Even have them in my sleep and wake up in the night with the feeling that I'm dying... so... I haven't been around much. 
> I'd like to thank all you mods 

There's only one mod! And who has been doing a remarkable and excelling job running this subreddit.  I agree, a big thank you /u/simmaltree!
Thank you so much /u/Becky_rw and /u/s-b. I really appreciate your encouragement and will continue to do my best to serve this community.
Thank you so much and please take the time you need for your own health. 
My pleasure and I'm so glad to hear you're doing a lot better. All the best to you.
And thank you, too :)
Lol... Reddit really is more helpful and friendly then my parents think.  
Hahahaha. Thank you for the joke and I'm sorry about the not so funny reality behind it. Emotionally manipulative people are so draining. I wish you a lot of quality time for self care and great health in the new year. 
Thank you ! I really appreciate your encouragement and will continue to do my best to serve this community.
Thank you for sharing those three insightful points. You're right - everyone here is doing their best to fight their own struggles and by supporting each other we can reach higher. Wishing you a great year ahead as well.
Please take out time to care for your self. Get the help, rest, self-care you need. All the best :)
Thank you so much for resolving to do that in the future. All the best.
I'm so sorry to hear that. No pressure to be around - please take care of yourself first. That is very important. Wishing you the best.
Thanks. Also read in the comments you run this whole sub on your own? That's amazing. 

That sounds horrific. I wonder how many people buy psychotropic drugs off the net now you can buy practically anything.

The government need to redirect some of those war funds!
Don't think its funding that is the problem at all.  Its the FACT that seeking treatment for mental health in the US can completely destroy your family, career, retirement, finances, etc.

That isn't the way it should be; but it most certainly is the way it is.

I agree with the overall sentiment of this article but I am not entirely comfortable with the cancer analogy. Rather than being rooted entirely in biology and chemicals, mental health is also the product of experiences, environment and relationships. I think the article misses a trick: stigma and victim-blaming are not only responses to mental illness but actively contribute to mental illness.
Calling them selfish also implies that they owe it to others to keep living rather than their life having intrinsic value. It's like saying that the pain others feel at the loss of their loved one to suicide is more important than the pain the individuals are going through that makes them suicidal. That's not true and it's not right. They're fighting a very real battle and just because people on the outside can't always see it doesn't mean it's not happening. They need support and understanding, not guilt tripping and name calling.
Calling them selfish is just one step up from calling them cowards.
 If ever you have lost a loved one to suicide, you know how much that hurts.
Sorry I really disagree with this, and don't think using this description is necessarily victim blaming. I accept that it's possible, such as the hypothetical "smug self-assured" asshole mentioned, but assuming everyone is that person is an interpretation concocted in your head (try not to assume people have bad motives). 

Clearly the most crass response to suicide is just calling it evil, flat wrong, 'going to hell', or bullying about 'taking the cowards way out'. However, linking it to selfishness is a big step up in nuance, by basically admitting that it can be a better option for the person themself to finally find some peace. But that description also makes people who are in the depths of despair at least reconsider their friends & loved ones who will bear the devastating impact, whose lives can be really screwed up by something they have no decision in.

Personally I don't believe in any meaning in the universe or greater power, and certainly would have no moral qualms about choosing a permanent dreamless sleep in times of real darkness. But understanding the fact of the matter as ultimately selfish helps keep in perspective that I could never take that option while I still have people close to me in life.

That's like saying it's selfish for a guy in a crashing plane to die because it would devastate his family, or that it's selfish for a guy to get crushed by a 600-pound rock because it would hurt his loved ones. "You just have to be strong! Lift that 600-pound rock *for your family*."

Telling them that it's selfish only adds to their guilt and makes them feel worse. Making suicidal people feel worse doesn't do much to help the situation...
You don't need to do that lol.
>However, if more people viewed suicide as a selfish act, then that might discourage people from committing suicide.

I understand where you are coming from, but as somebody that works in the field, I can tell you that the opposite is true. Stigmatising ideas of suicide and calling them selfish discourages people from talking openly, increases isolation and ultimately worsens mental health. This makes suicide more likely.
And now, after meds tweaking and therapy, I've gone from that to hypomanic major panic attack mode all the way back to fairly stable (for now at least - taking it day by day).

Brains are strange, huh?


I'm glad things are looking better for you.
Brains are so completely strange and fucked up. Glad to hear things have changed for you. I remember having similar thoughts regarding looking back at depressive times, and it would just blow my mind. Cheers!
Thx for showing me (and prolly some others here) that things can get better at somepoint :)

Thanks for sharing.  Getting the right treatment is hard work, and I'm glad you stuck with it.  I went through a similar process - you're not alone.
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

Yeah, I've dabbled in psychoactives (LSD etc.) and the feeling of coming out of a bipolar cycle is, for me, very similar to the feeling of coming out of a scary trip: that terror followed by elation followed by hypomania followed by relative stability. Except slowed down like 300 times.

Or at least that's my experience, YMMV.
<3
Yeah, it was a hell of a ride. Thanks for commenting.


I hope all goes well.
Wish you the best. 
If you haven't already, talk to your teachers / professors about your situation.  They've seen it all before so they'll likely be one of your best sources for a dose of reality in how to best manage the situation.

It may not be as bad as you think.

Best of luck.
Congratulations on getting near the end. I left school when I was 14 and it's been a great regret of mine. I'm fine that I missed out now. 

I like your drawing. 
Pretty powerful quote, very poetic too
You can do it! Don't be discouraged if you end up having to graduate late. That happened to me and he first few days after finding out were hard, but I forced some fake optimism and it all turned out to be okay. I figured I couldn't do anything about it at the time, so I made he best of it. It is hard, very hard, but I promise once you graduate it will feel great!  Time really does fly. Congratulations! 
Thanks man. Me too 🤞🏼
Really appreciate that🙏🏼 all the best too. Hang in there 
Hey! Thanks for the thinking of me. Your advice is totally sound and the school has actually been pretty understanding. But the current situation I'm in where my parents booked flights and everything for graduation and I've left it this late to realise oh shit really really I can't save this situation, this is beyond what the school can accommodate i think, which is reasonable. Ah I've just really screwed myself but thanks anyway🙏🏼
Damn thanks man. Idk if i deserve that congratulations- have wasted my parents' money paying fees for classes I didn't attend and in 40 mins, am abt to sit for an exam that am very likely to fail. Funny, we're on two different sides of the fence: me I would have preferred to just work first and buy myself some time to figure out what next but I went with my parents' plan (voluntarily- I didn't have any alternatives to actively pursue) and now at the end of uni, I can't shake the disappointment and guilt from this whole experience. It's really good you don't regret not going anymore. Because school is something you can do anytime you want tbh and it's a WHOLE lot better to go when you're really sure that's what you want.

Thank you for liking my drawing ❤️😭 it's the only thing I do nowadays that makes me want to keep on doing so your validation has made me rly happy. Thank you for commenting, hope you have a nice day my man:)
Completely agree about the quote. Really glad you like it 
Damn, thank you! I have been trying to do as you did bit wow it's so hard. Usually at low points I've been able to overcome resentment at friends doing well when I'm struggling but it's really an upward hill everyday. It helps knowing that people have felt this way so seriously thank you 🙆🏻
Don't ever feel guilty because your parents spent there money on your education. You didn't ask to be born and part of being a good parent is making sure your child an education. 

I'm poor and childless but I know if I had a kid and owned my own house I would sell it in order for them to get the best education that I could buy them.

I wish I could draw. Both my sister and brother can but I can't. I like doing web design. Am thinking of studying it again as a hobby and then do an adult course when I'm feeling better. Thing is I did an adult course in it a few year ago and I wanted to hand code it but the teacher wanted me to do it in dream weaver so I refused. Never finished the course because I couldn't produce a website. Might go back to a different college, or maybe do an online course. Only just thought of that now, I bet they have them.

Good luck with your exam.
You are very welcome! I'm happy it helped! Knowing we aren't alone can really make the difference. I understand being resentful, I've struggled with that a lot as well, I think that is why connecting with other people who go through the same emotions helps too. I'm here to talk anytime! 
Thank you for saying that I didn't ask to be born; I've thought that many times to myself but I can't say it so it really helped to hear that. You're right that my parents are just being good parents. That's what makes me feel so guilty though, like, why can't I be a good child. And I'm actually okay with feeling guilty i don't mind being accountable for everything I've done (or not done). But messing up with uni is a huge costly mistake. Worse part is they will even try to understand, having seen me struggle before. But when they get stressed about how much money they've spent, and I know they're definitely going to, idk how much they understand about this mental health aspect. Man, I'm still struggling trying to understand this aspect of my life myself yknow? How can I help them understand without making excuses for myself?

Sorry for ranting. Just thank you for being a really understanding ear in this void. Honestly, I relate alot to my parents as human beings and even though as an internet stanger my opinion doesn't really matter, you sound like you're are going be a really good parent if you do become one and I kinda hope it happens for you.

Yo I really relate with your journey with web design. I never pursued art at any higher level than middle school hahaha but my experience with art and school was similar. I loved drawing but school art was always weird to me and I barely passed that class throughout school even though I drew alot in my free time. Going to a different course that will allow you to further your talent the way you want to such a good idea actually. So much about being happy in life is just putting your energies towards exactly what you want, and your self awareness as to what you enjoy about web design and how you want to do it is going to at least make sure that when you pursue it again, you're going to go alot further.

About the exam, thank you 🙏🏼it went as expected but at least it's over.
Hi everyone. I live in Ontario Canada and last week my wife was admitted to the hospital for her depression. We don't know how long she will be staying there, but I just got a call from her work today letting me know that they're firing her. Is this legal? Is there anything we can do about it? I appreciate any help we can get.

EDIT: Thanks so much for all the support and information. It's been a busy week so I'm sorry I haven't been able to respond that much. I've talked to work and let them know all the information I've I can find, they've said they're going to try an accommodate her in someway and they will let me know what they come up with on Tuesday, which sounds promising.
I'm in Ontario as well.  They 100% can't fire her for that. They should give her a leave of absence or short/long term disability.
That being said, employers can often find a way to fire people due to illnesses but they change the reason. So they will find another reason to fire her. Make sure she/you knows the reason for termination.
I'm pretty sure that it's illegal, well I think that in a lot of countries it's, because you're discriminating someone over a mental health condition. Your wife got fired because of her mental condition or it was another explanation? 
Ask /r/legaladvice 
**Disclaimer:** I do not know Canadian law at all, but someone in /r/legaladvice might.

With that disclaimer out of the way, keep the following in mind:

* If you live in a "right to work" jurisdiction, or if her employer was otherwise allowed to fire her without cause, there is a chance it was legal.  

* If she was fired for performance issues rather than because of an illness or disability or membership in any other protected class in your jurisdiction, then there is a chance it was legal.  

* You've mentioned that her former employer's explanation was that "she's in the hospital too long and they need to have someone fill her position" and further stated that "Other than that she's a great employee."  Do you have either of those in writing?  If you have a statement, in writing, from her former employer that she was "a great employee," that is going to help your case that she was fired because of an illness or disability.  If you don't have anything like that in writing, your case is going to be harder, but not impossible.

* Has she actually been terminated?  Do you have anything in writing from the company terminating her employment?  Has she received any severance pay, vacation days, or anything similar?  

* It's extremely unlikely that anything you do will get her job back.  While I don't know anything specific about Canadian law, I cannot imagine a court would *force* a company to take back an employee that they fired.  If this case ends well for you, you will almost certainly receive compensation in the form of damages or statutorily-mandated payments rather than her getting her job back.

Basic fairness says this sort of thing *should not* be allowed to happen.  My experience tells me that this sort of thing happens and is allowed to happen all the damn time.
Fellow ontarioan here. Was her position full time? Disability pay and insurance are often full time only. As a casual in the federal  government, for example, if you cannot perform in the window they hired you for, they can fire you pretty easily. Once you have a term or indeterminate, options for disability open up. 

If it involves government coverage and disability, let me know and I may be able to direct you. 

Wishing her a speedy recovery. 
In the US that would be a violation of FMLA and I would think Canada would have similar laws and protections, if not better. In the US there's a very short time limit on filling claims, so contact a local employment law attorney or the equivalent of the department of labor to see what the process is. 
That's just straight-up discrimination.
This has happened to me too. I was let go by my employer after I mentioned that I deal with mental illness and would need some sort of accommodations to cope with it. They said they couldn't accommodate me and had me leave. I'm not sure if what they did was illegal, but a lot of people have told me that it was unfair of them to do that.

I hope your wife is doing okay. Clearly that workplace was not for her if they can't accept that she needs time off because she is in the hospital.

It honestly makes me mad at how much employers underestimate mental illnesses. I bet you that if your wife was in the hospital for a physical injury or illness they probably wouldn't have fired her. Shame on them.
File a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. This is a disability covered under the Human Rights Act. If she has a union file a grievance at at least step 2. If not seek a lawyers assistance.
That's awful!!! I'm so sorry!! I've no idea how to help but I hope you get justice!!
Jesus....cutthroat modern society...if something doesn't work toss it out and replace it.... that includes people...

well then how would he go about seeking legal remedy?
I'm just going to chime in on this one and ask if she was on a probation period? I live in the maritimes and am currently on EI for the next three months due to mental illness to regulate medication. I'm just baffled Ontario would do that :/
Lawyer up
I would suggest consulting an employment lawyer who specializes in wrongful dismissal. You may be able to access this through free or low cost legal aid clinics, depending on where in Ontario you are located. I hope your wife is getting the care she needs. This is not legal, whether she was probationary or not. The courts tend to side with employees especially in cases of disabilities. Good luck!
Also Ontario, firing someone for any disability (mental illness counts as such) is 100% against the law. Employers are required to accommodate disabilities up to the point that it would cause them "undue hardship" which is generally pretty hard for them to prove.  
Thanks for the response. Their explanation is that she's in the hospital too long and they need to have someone fill her position. Other than that she's a great employee
In reply to that, I know a wrongful termination pretty well, and when I asked him about this, he said this would be incredibly illegal, and we live in a "right to work" state. Sure there could be other things going on, but if Canada has laws like America, this is incredibly illegal. 

The lawyer I know agrees with the idea that she may not get the job back, but, if this were the US, a settlement for a large amount of money would most likely be made.

If OP gets to this comment, NY advice would be to call a wrongful termination lawyer in your area. Call them up,( you'd be surprised how many lawyers give a free consultation) and tell them your story. If you have a case, they'll let you know and be happy to help (because most wrongful termination lawyers work off of contingency, meaning they'll get a percentage of what you settle for.) 

Good luck OP.
/r/latestagecapitalism
That's classic discrimination grounds there.
I would hope that the law in Canada would provide for long term leaves of absence.  Her employer may not be able to guarantee her specific job, but they should be required to have a comparable position for her.  Keep us up to date on what happens.  
Does Canada have anything like the FMLA, where you're allowed so much time off for medical reasons without fear of termination? If so, get her medical records together & contact your version of the Labor Board. I had to help my brother with a situation like this a few years ago, but we're in the US.
The parent mentioned [**Wrongful Termination**](http://legaliq.com/Definition/Wrongful_Termination). Many people, including non-native speakers, may be unfamiliar with this word. **Here is the definition:**^\(In ^beta, ^be ^kind)
****
A fired employee's claim that the firing breached an employment contract or some public law.
Where an employment contract requires termination only for cause, a terminated employee can sue for arbitrary discharge. Wrongful discharge claims usually arise, however, under the default rule of at-will employment, in which both labor and management can terminate the relationship at will. In some states, a terminated worker can sue for wrongful discharge under contract law if he can show an implied contract for permanent employment, combined with a ...

Agreed. I was fired for the same reason (in the US though) and always wished the company would have paid for it. I was too sick to deal with it until after the statute of limitations was up.    
Not a lawyer, but is there anything in Canada that exempts businesses of a certain size from specific labor laws? Are they a big company or a small one?
This exactly! From what all I have read about at least laws in the USA (where Im at), they must guarantee her a job even if it is not the same job or it is a case for discrimination. A quick google search led me to this page and Im sure that if you dig deeper you can find how to sue for discrimination or push the case. https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/employment-standards/federal-standards/leave.html

Surprised? Research says financial and job stress, frustration, combat, poverty and drug use are all associated with suicide. Few people are well equipped to deal with today's challenge-every-second environment (if one is [conditioned](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=operant+classical+conditioning), [socialized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=socialization+psychology) and [normalized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=normalization+social+psychology) in childhood to try to play all the games in (and of) the [consensus trance](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-10-steps-for-recovery-from.html). Is [mindfulness](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+) the answer? Looks that way to me. (Drugs made it all waaaaaay worse for me before I got clean, but I was still conditioned, etc.)
>While men are still more than three times more likely to commit suicide than women, the suicide rate for women increased more than for men: the age-adjusted suicide rate for women increased by 45%, while the rate for men increased by 16%.

>The suicide rate increased for women of all ages, but the spike was especially pronounced for women aged 45-64. And although such incidents are comparatively rare, suicides of girls aged 10-14 increased 200% in that period, to 150 in 2014.

I love that suicide only gains attention when it starts to affect women. I mean the main focus of this article is on women despite the fact that men are still 300% more likely to die as a result of suicide. I mean, I get it, that's a concern... Obviously. But I can't help but be a little disgruntled when you're alarmed about this group (which is a third the size of the other group) after you've spent decades ignoring male suicide.

Wellllllll, I'm not sure it's quite as bad as Hegel, Marx, Durkheim, Cooley, Weber and some others pictured it, but I will agree that there are some pretty nasty cynics in the eye at the top of that pyramid on the back of your dollar bill. There *are* definitely ways around it, however. I found Art Deikman, Charles Tart, Alan Watts, Pema Chodron, Chogyam Trungpa and Jiddu Krishnamurti (among others). I just do the [10 StEPs](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-10-steps-of-emotion-processing.html) do to stay out of that trance. ([Externalizing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=externalizing+vs+internalizing+causes) the cause of all my problems was a sure way to drive me nuts.) 
It's sad but I'm becoming more and more convinced of this idea as the years go on.
Source? I'm not saying your wrong, just want to know of this is true.

Learned this one the hard way.
While it's better than a completely reactionary stance, I'd like to see attention paid to social factors that produce these behaviors.

This woman is such an inspiration to me. I used to be anorexic and I used to HATE myself, so much, and she got me through everything. I love her so much I'm tearing up writing this comment.
Good for them. The stigma is slowly getting destroyed!!
She wears a meat dress and wants to talk about mental health? Srsly?
What's the point your making? I don't see how wearing meat bears upon someones mental health.
She tried to help someone...quick, shit on her.
She's a performance artist and the meat dress was part of a performance.

It isn't like she wears one to go dress shopping in at the supermarket.
Suddenly you want sense and lines of basic causation. Riiiight....
I think the issue is more what is meant by the performance...
I'm still not getting your point. She openly admits she suffered from mental health problems. 

People with mental health problems often are incredibly creative and eccentric.
That performance meant something significant. Go read about it in Wikipedia
This. Often those with mental health problem's are those that feel irregular or out of place all the time. So while some venture into that mindset from time to time, there are those that feel this way 24/7. Why put someone down for sharing perspective. Why put someone down that looks at life differently. Without "abnormal" perspectives life just remains the same. No progress, no change. (No this is not entirely about Gaga.) 
Life years taken from mental illness compared to other diseases like cancer are much higher, yet research going into mental health is a fraction of what it is for cancer, for every 1 dollar spent on mental health research, 14 is spent on cancer. As far as treatment goes it seems mental health is the most expensive, so it seems finding better treatments would save a lot of money, but very little is spent compared to these other diseases, what is the reason for this?
Don't know the answer to your question, but if you seriously think QALYs are a good way to prioritize treatment (I do), then most money should be spent on malaria and schistosomiasis.
Stigmatization and the fact that people still think that mental illnesses are something that "you can just get over" by thinking about happy things.
Because cancer is mainly a physical illness which is visible meanwhile mental illnesses can't be seen so to many they're not as aware of it.


Currently studying biomedical sciences. I feel like most of you are being a bit harsh on the medical community.  
I think it's important to keep in mind that we know a lot more about cancer than about mental illness. Cancer is easier to study. We know a lot of genes that could be involved in cancer. We can 'easily' turn genes on and off in cells and study the effects, whereas turning brain neurons on and off is impossible.  
A lot of cancer research is done on animals. Mice are given tumors and then given medicine to see whether or not it could be a potential cure. Mice are great for purposes like this, but studying mental health in mice is most likely not going to lead to great breakthroughs. You'd have to preform tests and experiments on actual humans for that, which comes with a lot of obvious ethical dilemmas.  
The goal of cancer medicine is clearer than that of mental health medicine. Kill cells that are dividing uncontrollably, while damaging as little healthy cells as possible. The goal of mental health medicine? Make someones brain function? It's a little vague and like I said; relatively little is known about mental health and the way the brain works.  
  
  
I'm a little tired right now, but I hope most of this makes sense. This is just from a research-oriented perspective though. Whether people actually want to fund mental health research is a different topic all together.  
  
  
TL:;DR: We know a lot more about cancer than mh, researching cancer is easier than researching mental health

Objective results versus subjective results looks better on a doctor's CV.
Kids and cancer, man.

Medical research is narcissistic at its core, dictated by fashionable or "easy" outcomes that play well with public narratives and funding providers. There's also business models influencing research too - treatments are expensive to produce and providers are private sector businesses after all.

The problem with psychiatric research is the relative subjectivity of it, much less glamorous outcomes, and the lack of public interest despite its burden on society.

As another commenter says, it would make more sense to primarily place efforts of conditions that cause greater global disability (many infective diseases top this list, killing millions in developing countries). It's not gonna happen though.
Well, you're powerless to stop cancer and need to be saved. If you've a mental illness chances are you're too... disabled, I guess, to do anything about it yourself or have the mental capacity to know what to do to help yourself, but ultimately if you can muster it and educate yourself about your psyche and use certain excercises you can improve simply by doing things on your own in a way you just can't if you have a deadly disease.

Death from isolation is very, very serious, but it's such a different problem from cancer.
Because cancer sufferers are generally considered victims by the public at large and are thus sympathized with.   

Mental health issues are by some considered to be not trying hard enough, just looking for attention or weak

Source:.   Personal experience
We know what causes cancer and where it can be found in the body but we have exactly no idea what causes mental illness or how it's related to our body. You can't study something invisible in the same way you can study something tangible so cancer is easier to study. Easier to study means more research and funding.
Quality adjusted life years?
> schistosomiasis

There are less than 20,000 reported cases a year. It is very rare. That's throwing money away. I'm sorry if someone has it but millions are affected by mental illness. 

You are definitely over simplifying it🤔
Cancer hits people they like. Mental health problems hit people they don't like... Not correlating that they don't like them due to their mental health problems. 
Yes, exactly
> schistosomiasis

Perhaps I should have said instead "Neglected Tropical Diseases", which affect over 200 million people. Sometimes "schistosomiasis" is used as a general term, just as "leprosy" is used to refer to all kinds of skin diseases, not just Hansen's disease.
Absolutely. Pretty sure you could write a book on this subject. Either way, I just wanted to make clear that it's not just that 'no one cares about mental health and everyone cares about cancer'.  
I'm definitely not justifying anything, just wanted to shed some light on the subject from a perspective that had not yet been mentioned.
Too bad you were down voted because you say something interesting. I would just rephrase you:

Mental illness is less glamorous. Less Hollywood or hbo friendly. The representation of a person fighting an intern enemy is glued to oncology.

Mental illness is Not enough portrayed accurately in the media out not enough normalised like in the movie silver linings or tv show mr. Robot.

I think Batman and its asylum is still a very well rooted image in people's minds

Er, I am slightly confused on what your saying. I downvoted because it sounds like downplaying mental illness
Fair enough
It's not about how much words are used, it's about the content... What we know about mental health doesn't compete with how much we know in oncology. On what basis are you saying that? Number of books? Number of publications? You'd be amazed of how much is known and confirmed in mental health and chocked at how much is still ignored in oncology. 

I can't see anything that can explain that "we know much more" ...
Certainly not downplaying, but I was purposely being crude. 

I felt the comment I was responding to could be basically boiled down to what I said. 

I think that is a problem. Generally, mental illness prevents effective socialization, which therefore reduces the person's social network, and consequently reduces the likelihood of impacting a scientist to throw their effort into the problem. 

In contrast, cancer doesn't effect a person's social network, and effects those with large and small networks to equal degrees. This increases the likelihood of impacting a scientist to throw their effort into the problem. 

My friend's BIL just died of cancer. He was loved by his family, his coworkers, he was even his kids' baseball coach, etc. Everyone loved him. Countless people love him. 

On the other hand, if I killed myself tomorrow, maybe up to 5 people would realize it within the first month. 
I see what your saying. Cancer gets more publicity so its looked at more.
I think doctors can be compelled to help mental illness though if it were to be more widespread in information and understood to be a debilitating disease.

As others have said , I'm sorry for your loss , I truly am. After reading those comics , to some extent I could feel/understand where she (I assume from the comics?) is coming from. I wish I could have a conversation with this person considering I myself have my own issues , just to have conversation always made me feel better about my issues but sadly she has passed , may her soul be at peace now.
So sorry for your loss.  She was a very talented and bright young woman.  
I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you not only for sharing your friends work but taking the time to answer people in this thread. 
It's a wonderful comic. I'm so sorry she didn't make it.

Also, so sad for her poor mom.   
I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a talented artist, and a warrior for battling with some really tough issues.

As someone who suffers from anxiety, I've never heard of psychosis.
Thank you. Keep getting better. :)

The family haven't released further details yet. From what I gather, her psychosis got worse and people with the condition are very likely to hurt themselves or others.
You can't die from psychosis itself (as far as I know) but it can lead to suicidal behaviours.
Thank you. I'm certain she would have done everything in her power to help you.

You're welcome to message me and I'll do my best. I know that conversation is also helping me mourn her and move on.
Thank you.
Thank you. I hope this comic helps people. :)
Thank you. Her family were really supportive. They have a big support network so they will get through alright.
Thank you. Psychosis is a sort of umbrella term indicating a person loses touch with reality. It can involve auditory and visual hallucinations which the person cannot distinguish from reality.

Her specific condition was Delusional Disorder, but it's hard to define these things as they never fit neatly into categories.
Yes.
[deleted]
Oh gosh :(

I've felt those kinds of "removed from reality" feelings many times. I feel like an observer outside all that exists at te very moment. I question what everything is, what this is, etc.

This makes me even more sad to know she battled this too.
I think it's important to say that she passed away due to psychosis rather than suicide. You would say someone died of cancer, its the same with mental illness. So sorry for your loss. 
Thank you. Make sure you're getting the help you need and hang in there. You are not your illness. :)
Hang in there, and make sure you're getting help. :)
Right. I could say my grandfather died of pneumonia. People would be shocked and ask "how could he die of pneumonia?" "Oh yeah, he had bone marrow cancer." Without the bone marrow cancer there would have been no pneumonia. Without the mental illness, there wouldn't have been any potentially deadly behaviors.

Love her! Imperfect perfection, with a healthy dose of bad ass.  I don't look up to many athletes/celebs but she is just awesome. She is an animal lover to boot. Who could hate on that?
Update: She did an IMA today!
Great post! I'm far from a knowledgeable UFC fan, but  I can't help but admire everything about this woman. There are so few female athletes who are given this spotlight and when they are, it's almost always because of their appearance. Not only is she beautiful, but she's also a beast at her sport and all of her other endeavors. On top of that, I have another reason to root for her as she's a champion of mental health. Good stuff!
I know! I would've been on it but I saw Penn and Teller, so I missed it. But I read about her responses later, she is pretty cool. 
Came here to say this. Happily found it's not just me. She is my hero. I want to be her when I grow up. (She's only two years older than me, lol)
So great to read this! I don't think too many people are in the know about her mental health activism. But it's something that should be more known about her. It helps to know that even people who seem as strong as she does still have vulnerability and fears, which they must face to be as good as they become. 
;) 

I found this list excessively depressing.
[deleted]
Thanks.  Like any list, not every suggestion will work for everyone.
[Re-re-repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/3bosxa/selfcare_printablepdf/)

It sure is. Even reading it makes you feel better.
I love this. I hope I remember to look at it.

But, take a selfie? Ewwwwwwww.....
Ditto
For me, it's a list of ideas rather than a checklist of things that should be done.

Some days one of the things will be helpful, some days others will be useful, there may be some on there that are of no use to one person at all.
Sorry, didn't realise. I'll delete if it annoys people!
Yeah, there are some there that really wouldn't work for me (but that I know would be good for some of my pals). I think there is at least one I can do for most situations I can think of where I'm having a bad time :)
Don't worry about it, unless /u/simmaltree has a rule about reposts.
not if it helps folks :)

I really like them so far but do you post them anywhere outside Instagram? I have a hard time going through all of your comics.

And since I feel bad that you haven't got anything so far and being an artist myself, how well does this help for you?
That's pretty cool. Keep it up! I think I read all your comics. I feel like all of them are so relatable, especially the ones about not making any progress and loneliness. 

I wrote some short stories about anxiety and depression. It definetly helps. I used to write everyday like last week. But now I'm just web browsing all day. 

Loved the "I am enough" and the "Dear Depression" ones. I like the design too. The depression looks like an IBM from Ajin. 

Sorry for the long comment. Oh, I didn't ask anything. So... I don't know. Where did you learn how to draw? 
Loved your comic - another follow
These are awesome! Thank-you for sharing them. I don't have a question, but keep it up. These are really relatable. 
Hey thank you! I also post them on Facebook and tumblr.
https://justpeachycomic.tumblr.com/

This works well as a form of journeying for me. I knew that journaling is supposed to help with depression, but I could just never force myself to sit down and write. The solution for me came with comics because they are short, and I've always loved drawing, so it seemed like a perfect combo. 
Thanks for your comment! :) I am glad you liked them. IBM looks cool!

I learned to draw at a young age (2nd grade) and have been going ever since. I'm 24 now. 
Thanks so much! Hope it helps. :)
Thanks so much. I will be keeping it up as much as I can. 
Almost everyday I'm reminded of something I once said or did that was dumb but I'm still embarrassed about all of those things. They're all minimal and not worth worrying about but I'm not sure why/how it happens. Is this normal?
I taught myself to catch it if I start ruminating on my past embarrassments and change my thought process to something else I enjoy.  I feel so much better and more positive.   
I do the saaaaame thing. I feel guilty even. 
All the time.  I still remember feeling guilty or embarrassed years ago.  It's awful at times but it's never been *too* bad I guess.
Absolutely normal! I do this all the time. When it gets to rumination I try to distract myself with something mentally taxing or absorbing (or something funny). 

I also think about how many 'embarrassing' things I remember other people doing - very few. So that probably goes for how much other people remember my embarrassing moments. 

I think it's my anxious brain trying to make sure it doesn't happen again, but not quite getting a healthy balance between learning from the past and ruminating!
After watching Inside Out, I have decided that my memory workers are jerks. I constantly, randomly, remember something really embarrassing that happened 10+ years ago. And it's something lame too, like this one time, in middle school (that was closer to 20 years ago, now I feel old), I tripped myself in P.E when we were playing Volley Ball. The whole class saw me, at the time it was really embarrassing. But I know none of those people remember or care about that.
I get that a lot, yeah. It's not as bad as it used to be, though, since I learned a few methods of dealing with them.

One method that works for me is to closely examine a memory instead of pushing it away. If you try to look at those old memories from a more impartial perspective, you often realise that you're beating yourself up for nothing. A few times I've even realised that I was remembering something completely wrong, and that the event wasn't nearly as bad as I was telling myself all these years.

Failing that, you could always tell yourself that you've been sentenced to "time served". Essentially, just say that while what you did was bad, the suffering you've inflicted on yourself with the memory since then more than makes up for it. 

It doesn't always work, but I've found it to be helpful sometimes.
I opened an email and shook my head because someone sent me an offensive joke about cancer that wasn't even funny. Then a girl asked me what the joke was. I told her I did not want to repeat it because it was offensive and not funny. She kept insisting on hearing what it was. I told her the gist of it. Then she said "my little brother had cancer." Then I felt embarrassed for the both of us and I said something like "that's terrible. yeah, that joke is awful."
once a week at least, I feel the full face flush and everything then I try to remember that Im probably the only person who even remembers.   Doesnt make it suck any less or stop happening though.
I think this is a pretty universal experience.  We tend to remember the things that make us cringe or blush or get upset because we've learned to hold onto these emotions and not share or show them.  I think good feelings, victorious or happy moments, don't pop up the same way because we're completely comfortable having them in the moment and processing them.
I think in these situations most of the bad feelings don't come from embarrassment of the actual event, but the feeling that people will think less of you or treat you differently because if it. Just remember that everyone makes mistakes, and the people who love you won't think anything less of you for doing something embarrassing. In fact I find it refreshing to be around people who make mistakes or do embarrassing things because it reminds me that it's okay for me to do those things also! 
Ha! Like everything I do, I obsess about. I will replay conversations in my head over and over again. They are even *really* embarrassing things, just every day occurrences. Honestly, I think I block out the embarrassing stuff altogether. Its not healthy and I'm working on it though.
If you don't mind sharing could you give an example? I feel like I try to do this but maybe I'm approaching it incorrectly
It happens all the time but in my case it's always something stupid. For example today I thought about one time in elementary school my science teacher asked me to name a state (meaning scientific state of matter like liquid, solid, gas) and I named a US state instead. Obviously that isn't something worth worrying about but it happens ALL the time.
oh man the guilt one is bad too, things I did as a little immature brat still hit me from time to time.
That's on her though. You totally warned her of the content being offensive 
I think of something funny that happened.  Or a tv show joke that I thought was funny.  Whatever I laughed about last.  Sometimes I just think of peoples smiles like My mom, My niece, people I love.
I watch a lot of comedy shows and avoid anything too heavy, especially on certain days.  Frasier and Curb your Enthusiasm are my go to shows because they make fun of a lot of everyday situations and it helps me to find humor in the little things in life.  

Once I started actually focusing on my thoughts, I realized how much control I have over them. Doubt and fear start to sneak into my head and I let Dr. CRANE escort them right out. Haha

So, what now? I knew that already beforehand, and quite frankly, didn't need an entire article explaining how optimism will score better.
What this article, imo, failed to do, especially if we consider it's place here, was to explain/elaborate upon some strategy for actually changing your own outlooks.
Maybe it's just me, but I felt that this article was a waste of words. 
Nice self promotion of your blog. Crap article though
Thanks for the read
Thanks for the read

I guess it incentivises suicide because now you don't have to pay the bill.
If it works as a deterrent, fine.
How would it? No one thinks, "Well, I was going to try to kill myself, but my health insurance doesn't cover it so I stayed home."
I'd bet it does the opposite.
Then the bill goes to your estate and your widow/kids/parents don't get that money.
I think it will deter people who are not really committed to it. Not sure how it would encourage suicide. Then again it might encourage people who are committed to make their attempt more thorough and less survivable.

Edit: Man you guys are harsh. I don't know why my little speculative participation in this discussion needs to be buried in downvotes.
The exemption makes it so they won't pay for medical treatments after a suicide attempt. If they were successful there would be no medical treatment to be billing the estate on because they're dead.
May not encourage suicide, but it could definitely add to the pile of guilt they already have about their urges/attempts. Shitty feelings + other shitty feelings = more shitty feelings. 

Idk. I just can't see how it would deter anything. More likely, people would take the "fixing" from self harm into their own hands, like home brewed stitches... Could very well lead to more people getting more injured. 
I was thinking it might discourage attention seeking from people who don't actually want to kill themselves, but I confess I wasn't thinking of general self harm. That's something else altogether, and there's obviously plenty of cause to cover something like that as an illness.
Right, because every failed suicide attempt is "just" a cry for help? People don't just wake up one day and decide: hmm, today I think I'll be depressed and try to kill myself!

What about the people who are morbidly obese and have heart attacks and diabetes, what about alcoholics who drink till their liver shrivels and dies, what about smokers who end up with cancer? All these people made choices to harm themselves. Mental illness is NOT a lifestyle choice.

This isn't life insurance, this is health insurance.
> Right, because every failed suicide attempt is "just" a cry for help?

I never said that. And I don't know what you're talking about. You're preaching to the converted. 

Sorry, I should have noted that in link! 
These are all me.
Well, that was kinda triggering.  Good but hard for me.

Absolutely belongs here, along with [part 2](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html). I thought this line was particularly well articulated: "No, see that solution is for a different problem than the one I have." (Hence, my username). Wow, Allie, just, wow. 
This post was an eye opener for me. The overwhelming response and support she has received made me realize that many people all over the world have depression. It was the final nudge to getting me to accept that I, too, suffer from this.
This just helped me so much. I'm crying because of how amazing it is.
Yes! This SO Belongs here!
The accuracy, it burns!
I'm still waiting on that breakthrough though :/
Wait, friend. PM if you want to talk.
[This was my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/6i9llu/i_went_to_therapy_for_the_first_time_and_i_hated/)

So I ended up sending an email to the office and explaining what had happened to me, and the coordinator profusely apologized to me and told me that's not how therapy is supposed to go. They hooked me up with a different therapist to see right away, so I saw her on Friday and OH MAN was it completely different. It was so structured and organized and I finally felt in control of the situation. I read her the list of things I wanted to focus on in therapy sessions in the next few weeks which I didn't get the chance to do last time. She ended up being really nice and I feel like she's gonna be a really good fit for me.

I just wanna thank everyone for the advice in my original post and kind words because I felt really hopeless in that moment and wasn't sure what to do! I've had such bad experiences with all kinds of mental health workers, nurses, psychiatrists, etc. If anyone is ever having the same kind of problem where they feel they aren't getting the right kind of help, just be honest and tell somebody!!! That's the best thing you can do. Stand up for yourself and demand help, it's your right to have it and you deserve it. Thanks guys <3
Not all therapists are equal. Just like finding a medical doctor can take time, so can finding a therapist. While sharing personal information is a tool used by some therapist, it isn't something that everyone enjoys. The advice you were getting doesn't sound like it was in your best interest either. 

I am SO glad you found a better fit. Amazing job for following through with therapy, because a lot of people would have just said "screw it". Good job for standing up for yourself too. 
I'm so glad it's worked out and you found someone you like.

I generally advise people to see a couple therapists for one or two sessions then pick the best one. They're all so different! 

One time I met a great therapist, but our lives are so different he couldn't comprehend what I was talking about. It was a huge bummer. I have a career in technology and he just couldn't grasp the dynamics of my life.

And I've had a couple that made me really upset after leaving the session. Not in a good self-reflection sort of way, but in a "I'm terrible and everyone hates me" sort of way. One of them was my friend's therapist, and he loved her!
I'm glad you found someone you like. I hope things continue to get better.
Its hard to find someone who is good at what they do. True of any profession. Congrats on that.
Therapy is only as strong as the person to therapist relationship! Thanks for taking the time to share your experiences!

When there's (big) $$$ in it, it'll get wings. Right now, it's not a money maker (it's a *huge* money loser in the world of public health). Beyond that, most (far from all, but most) of those who check out are drug-addicted and troubling to others. *Not* being snide. I just know the statistics and the circumstances *first* hand. One can go have a look on the suicide sub-reddit to see whether or not I talking out the side of my neck. (I tried it twice myself, btw. I *know* what the inside of an ICU looks like when you come to after those huge shots of Haldol and Ativan.) 

I can use the [10 StEPs] (https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to get to sympathy, empathy and compassion for these people, but I also know where most of them are on the [five stages of therapeutic recovery](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-five-stages-of-recovery.html), and they're not interested in any [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy), [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system) or [schema therapy]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy) to deal with their [in-struct-ed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=social%20constructionism), [conditioned](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=operant+classical+conditioning), [socialized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=socialization+psychology) and [normalized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=normalization+social+psychology)[learned helpless](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=learned+helplessness), intensely [nihilistic](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=nihilistic) and/or [negativistic](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=negativism+definition) beliefs. Not always, but all too often, their righteous *egos* are killing them. (Just like mine almost did.)

"You can lead a horse to water..." 
I've always wondered if perception of corruption in society played a part. that "no matter how hard I work the system is rigged against me ever being successful/retiring" feeling. I mean that differently from how racism is discussed. Racism involves a people being held down. I think corruption is more of a notion that only certain people can ever move up. 

Thoughts?
Because there is no one to sue for damages and because feminism 👎
Well people don't choose to be a homicide victim.  
Ego is such a problem, and it seems like out shouldn't be. It's just a mental construct, the result of years of conditioning. 

That being said, and as you and I both know, conditioning isn't an easy thing to overcome. It's not even a difficult thing to overcome. It's brodignagian. Do you hold any disdain for your past self? The tone of your post gives me that impression. 

I ask just because I have come across your posts a couple times and I found them interesting. Not calling you out or trying to start an argument. Not even saying that you're wrong. Just curious. 
"Do you hold any disdain for your past self?"

Certain (more dysfunctional) parts of my ego do. Other (more functional) parts have observed >>>>>> understand (as per the first eight of those [10 StEPs](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing)) that -- as you have noted -- conditioning is what it is, and the neural wiring *is* there. 

Also, please stop throwing around the word "psychotic" to mean "acting in a way I myself would not act." In fact, behavior deemed colloquially "psychotic" is often socially non-normative in the patterns of personality disorders like Borderline and, very, very rarely, Antisocial. Not that casually throwing around a *different* clinical accusation is any better, but as someone that has both psychosis and borderline personality disorder, just... Fuck you, people who don't recognize the value of no longer hallucinating.
This needs to be more widespread.
I didn't read the full article, but I agree with this general idea. So many clients come into my office and complain of "anxiety" or "being anxious" when, after discussion, it comes down to experiencing general stress, not an anxiety disorder.  I've seen a number of these clients improve simply by rewording this. Anxiety is so stigmatized and I've witnessed clients making themselves out to be significantly more distressed, seemingly due to just using that word. 
People definitely do not know that psychopathy and psychotic are are not the same thing. Psychosis is no joke and people just assume based on fucking prefixes. Its incredibly frustrating. 
>"anxiety" or "being anxious" when, after discussion, it comes down to experiencing general stress, not an anxiety disorder

I really don't see the problem with this. Someone can have anxiety or be depressed without having an anxiety disorder or clinical depression. The word doesn't only exist in clinical settings, and besides, the biomedical model of mental illness is weak af so it's not like depression/anxiety at a clinical level are completely different creatures from the nonpathological depression and anxiety everyone experiences.
Indeed, when I was first diagnosed I was too stunned to ask any questions and just thought "so, am I a danger to people? Am I going to visit the neighbor's house in the night and rearrange everyone's intestines?" I spent a long time on line finding out what I was dealing with.
Title says it. Basically, I am outwardly this huge person, totally in control but inside I crave for attention. It bothers me that I get so dependent, and I do have plenty of other sources to get my attention from when my primary source is not available. It seems very horrible to say it but let's face the facts.

Therefore I have decided to start therapy from tomorrow. I don't know what it will make me, but a little less insecure would be amazing.


I know Narcs are viewed as monsters. I am not here to apologise for what other Narcs have done. I wish you well and a speedy recovery in your journey.
It is amazing that you are even aware of this. Most narcs find it absolutely unacceptable for anyone, including themselves, to see that they could possibly have a flaw. Because of this, most of them are never treated. I am happy for you that you are seeking treatment for a chance of a happy healthy future. I think the key is cultivating self awareness and empathy, treating others as you want to be treated. Also therapy to deal with childhood issues (cptsd?) will probably help. I wish the best of luck to you!  
Hey, many people never make it that far. I'm glad you're looking for help. Even if it isn't narcissism, you can still talk to someone about your needs. 
You are not a monster. You are someone who is aware and willing to make a change in yourself to become a better person. I went to group therapy with someone who had out of control delusions of grandeur and narcissistic personality disorder. The guy was in his mid sixties and was not able to come to the same conclusion as you. Be proud of the step you are taking and stay this open minded as you go through therapy. It's a tough road but damn is it worth it :)
Not all narcissists are malignant narcissists. You have self awareness and insight, which is pretty amazing  and is a good sign that therapy could help you. 

I don't like to look at it like some kind of curse you're stuck with forever. More like you have deeply ingrained interpersonal patterns that aren't working for you, and you'll have to come up with coping skills to compensate. Therapy can really help with that. Good luck tomorrow!
Good news.  I wish you good success.
Good luck! You are taking the right steps toward  living genuinely fulfilled and happy life! Yay!!
It's really awesome that you see it and are getting help. Best of luck to you. I'm sure you're hurting, so getting help is the right thing to do. 
People often neglect to mention that narcissists, sociopaths, and psychopaths are all individuals. The former two are crafted through childhood abuse, while the latter is a neurologically variant brain structure. There's so much stigma around all the conditions, but the truth is the overwhelming majority of people with these diagnoses are not going to cause others harm. It is wise to own up to things you want to fix them, and then setting out to fix them. Good luck.
Curious to know how you treat your primary supply?   If your primary external emotion to them is one of contempt, they're probably getting a bit tired lol.  I support your endeavor!  Narcs aren't evil.  Even a little bit of self awareness can change your life and your relationships!
What are your relationships with other people like?
Hello. Yes I was the same. I didn't want it but to be honest this was about a selfish reason too, I didn't want to look vulnerable. I didn't want anyone to have power over me. But either way, if something positive comes out of it, itll be better I guess. 

I have faced a lot of abuse- sexually, emotionally etc as a child. This will also be addressed in therapy :)

I start in an hour. Wish me luck!
It was a sudden realization :) But nevertheless led to a good step.
Poor guy. Many may have found him unbearable or annoying. But he was probably suffering so much inside.
Thank you for those words. I really would like to not think of it that way, and even if it was, I believe conscious behavioural changes can help.
Thank you so much!
Thank you. I really didnt expect anyone to be supportive.
Yes, exactly. Thank you for saying this. Im glad someone understands. Of course, the damage we have done is extensive.. but how will it resolve of people just mudsling instead of help..
I totally adore the person. I do think I love them. (But again, Im not sure because I will probably be fine without them). I am an attractive person and usually whenever I am single, there is a huge influx of men trying to ask me out so to be honest, there is never a supply drought so as to speak.

It sounds terrible when I say it like that but I just didnt know a better way to put it. Im off to therapy because they deserve to be treated in a better way too..
Best of luck! And please don't give up. I've had a lot of bad therapy / therapist / medication experiences that put a bad taste in my mouth. I got discouraged, which is very common. This stuff isn't easy. But I just kept looking for better therapists, better therapy techniques, and appropriate medications. And I found them. It can be a hard search, but if you are persistent, the results will absolutely be worth it. ☺️
It's one of the reasons I don't like people in general. I seldom have issues with individuals, but people in general just let ignorance and fear get the best of them. It doesn't help that narcissist, psychopath, and sociopath have all essentially become synonymous with someone who's an asshole or a dangerous person. Little do people know that the three demographics (along with the mentally ill and neurologically variant population) make up a fraction of the population, and that the vast majority of assholes they encounter are just mentally healthy or neurotypical people who happen to be assholes.
No reason to say "it sounds terrible" lol, it's probably true!!   I'm the primary supply to someone I love very much.  Often I wish they'd know how very LITTLE they would have to do to absolutely make my day!  Just a small gesture to say that I mean something to them would be amazing.  
If you are the primary, let me tell you, you mean A LOT to them. A huge chunk of my day is about others validating me. Saying "Aww claudine you look cute blah blah" and nobody's validation is as valued as the primary's. You have the highest power over them as they have over you. Seems very weird right? But its true. Whenever my P gets away or something, I am totally flustered for a while and lost (though I show NONE of this out) until I move on to my other sources to compensate for it. 

You matter a lot.
Thank you!!  I only recently discovered this. I usually keep my emotional reactions sealed but I kind of slipped up recently and you're right, they were "totally flustered."

The thing is I love them in a way no one else can.  I see the real them and I still love them.  Not at all saying it's "healthy" but we fit together.    I'm VERY aware that I walk a tite rope and that there are many other available sources out there, which is why I try very hard (and mostly succeed) at providing the BEST.    Unlike most people, I don't view it them as "awful," the dynamic works for BOTH of us!   The tiniest bit of genuine gratitude helps a lot though.

It's great that you're seeking out help!!  You sound incredibly self aware and I think you can do this!
The reason why they dont probably show it is because they think you will feel they NEED you (and you see how vulnerable it potrays them as). We are a sad bunch, really vulnerable and needy but can't afford to show it. 

Thank you! :)

This type of thing infuriates me. Whenever I hear people say "I'm so OCD!" because they like things neat, I want to tell them what it's like to have actual OCD. 

Last year Target had a sweatshirt that said "OCD: Obsessive Christmas Disorder." So insensitive.
The problem is, just like saying "oh that's retarded", using " OCD" as an adjective in common discussion has become a social norm.

It probably was a nonsense slipup, ao i hope they don't get beat up too much. 
It sounds better than anal or anal retentive but I understand the insult given how disabling OCD can be.

Are those bugs available in pill form? The strawberry Activia I drink doesn't seem to be helping much, and I can't stand other flavors of yogurt (and the flavorless ones taste like puke to me).
There's a lot of info coming out on the relationship between gut microbes and mental health. My personal favorite is Brain Maker by Dr. David Perlmutter if anyone is interested
Lol, what a massive simplification this headline is...
Yes, just search Amazon for lactobacillus pills.  That said, Activia drinks are thinned out, I think with milk, which basically puts the bacteria to sleep. I've always eaten a lot of yogurt, and for about 25 years, off and on, I've had (and still do to a significantly lesser degree) suicidal ideations and major depressive episodes.  Don't expect a magic bullet.  There's no such thing.  Eating some dannon isn't going to fix anything.  If you're dealing with depression, you should speak to a professional.
I highly doubt this is a universal fix. Various studies have shown various fermented foods & probiotics to be helpful for mental health, so you should certainly try a variety, but I wouldn't expect it to help everyone. 

There's more info in the /r/microbiome sidebar & wiki. 
Alright, thanx.

A few years ago, my physician brother in law was going through some mental health issues but refused to see anyone because his bosses would find out, he'd be deemed unable to work because of it.... so he never reached out to anyone. 
It's maddening. The guy just needed a little help with a psychiatrist... but physicians are punished for having mental health needs? 

He's okay now. I'm unsure of whether or not he still needs to speak with professionals.

The point is they need the availability to seek help for themselves without getting wiped from their med programs. 

Would he really have to use a fake name and travel out of town to a random mental clinic for help?

This is all so fucked. 

Everyone deserves mental help. 
I couldn't make it past the first minute of that. Maybe her message is strong but she clearly has issues. I won't even start with her weird late 80's Golden Girls style of dressing and I won't finish on her immediately starting about talking about how she visited morgues as a child but I'll just end with saying if this lady has an important message to deliver maybe she should have someone else carry the envelople. 
Same thing happened to my surgeon brother-in-law. Such a shame.


This describes my anxiety perfectly. Didn't even realize it was this bad. 
Yup. I keep working like I'm on crack but inside I feel a terrible guilt as if I've committed a crime. I focus on my tasks but in my head I'm running through a list of things that I could've or might've done wrong. I look calm but in my mind I'm trying to count the minutes until i can go him, cry in the shower and go to bed, hoping when I wake up this feeling will be gone. 
But how do you get a hold of it? You can rationalise and be as proactive as you possibly can but it never seems to go away. I keep expecting that if I just power through eventually it will subside but so far no joy. It's been going on like this for at least a year and a half. And the panic attacks are daily now. 
I hope your right. 
My thoughts go out to you. 
Same.. I can absolutely identify with all of this video 
I'm on the same boat, and it feels awful sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind. But I still feel there's a solution so for today I will keep my head up and I will fight for what's good inside me.

Wish you the best.

There's so much mental energy on this it could be used for something good. There must be a way and I hope I can find it.

Won't let me read the article w/o subscribing. Fuck that.
> Men often find it embarrassing to talk about how they feel. Especially, one suspects, when they don’t see themselves as being ‘strong enough’. After all, aren’t they supposed to be the ‘strong’ gender?

"I'm so 'strong' I'm going to live in fear over what other people think of me for the rest of my life and refuse professional help for life threatening health problems which will greatly increase the likelihood of me dying...Hey look mum, no hands!"
Basically society is retarded, and it unnecessarily screws over men in various ways including mental health problems, and it's good to talk...or something.
I think that's the whole article.

> Recent studies show that males aged between 20 and 49 are more likely to die from suicide than any other single form of death. In his very readable book ‘Depression: the Curse of the Strong’ Dr Tim Cantopher advocates that those who feel they need to be strong for others at whatever cost to themselves are most at risk of becoming depressed. And when depression takes a hold, suicidal thoughts may develop.

> Men often find it embarrassing to talk about how they feel. Especially, one suspects, when they don’t see themselves as being ‘strong enough’. After all, aren’t they supposed to be the ‘strong’ gender?

> When clients say they are feeling ‘suicidal’ they are often suffering from long-term depression. They can see no future. The light at the end of the dark tunnel has gone off. And they don’t know when – or if – if will come on again.This dark place can seem very alienating. It can be a lonely place to be.

> When this stage is reached, people often stop looking after themselves. They can become withdrawn and reclusive. Or violent and aggressive. They often feel isolated and trapped inside. They may use substances or develop behaviours which can become addictive. They may feel dis-engaged from the very people and interests which have kept them engaged in day-to-day living.

> Lost and bewildered, there seems to be only one way out. Down. They are in their own prison. It can feel like solitary confinement. Internal anger changes into despair and a sense of hopelessness.

> Making a decision to seek therapy and actually coming for an initial consultation when the future seems very bleak indeed may feel like an impossible feat. Yet it can be a small step when we start to learn that as a man it is okay to seek support – the world doesn’t come to an end. But the pain inside may be easing just a touch.

> A good therapist is supportive, non-judgmental, compassionate, accepting. An effective therapist enables those in distress to disclose how they feel. The client permits the therapist to shine a light into their darkness. It may only be a shimmer of light. And it may disappear for a while. It can actually be a start to the healing process.
There is a well hidden "CLOSE" hovering there to the right of the screen, just above the *Subscribe* box. I almost missed it. 

Anyway, the article is very accurate, but society really seems to NOT want to throw down the men are robots mentality and allow them/us to just be people rather than an antiquated stereotype. I'd rather not end up dead because the 1950s keeps calling. 
Man does this really seem like the right article to make a sarcastic remark about? You're criticizing people who are stuck in a cycle of suicidal tendencies and depression as if it's always as simple as you state it.
Yeah, the whole thing was blocked out for me unless I subscribed. There wasn't even an "x" to close the box.

I'll tell ya, I'm the demographic that this articles speaks about. And I'll be honest, I'm not sure talk therapy helps at all for many. What would help is work that isn't demoralizing. I'm 53, and since the crash there has been nothing out there for people in my position. No funds for retraining. And the only jobs are minimum wage or slightly above. All the jobs that the politicians love to tout that they've created - far too many of them have been shit jobs. That's why you don't see any headlines in the news about mean incomes going up. And all the talk in the world won't change any of the realities. There's no 'frontier' to move to to get a fresh start. And all the false optimism therapists love to try and pump in you is nothing but a cruel, empty joke.
> There is a well hidden "CLOSE" hovering there to the right of the screen

Thanks. It was over text so I didn't see it.
I'm not criticising people for being depressed or feeling suicidal, but rather the dumb social norms and beliefs which can cause and/or exacerbate these problems to begin with, which make those individuals more likely to suffer. I think the use of satire as a means to ridicule such concepts was apt in this case.
That wasnt the way it sounded to me at first. My bad I guess.
No worries, it's a delicate subject I guess.

I love your drawing! 
Is the caffeine necessary, or can you get by on decaf coffee? If you can get by on decaf, it might be best, considering you are also dealing with anxiety and sleep issues. But then, you've probably already heard that a thousand times by now.

The argument that it "brings you comfort therefore you need it" suggests to me that some effort should be taken to reduce the coffee intake in order to break that dependency. I like a good cup of coffee myself, but the sensation of NEEDING coffee seems unhealthy.
NAC works with depression? N-acetyl-cysteine?
I've had depression and GAD for most my life. That's a long, long time. I feel I take to many drugs for my mental health, so I try to limit as much as possible.

I would never ever mean to offended someone in a similar situation as myself (that's the last thing we need), but I do have some suggestions.

Aleve - Just an FYI. Aleve is a good pain killer but it can cause major/minor digestive upsets. Especially, stomach and esophagus. Therefore, maybe something like a couple Tylenol might be better for chest area pains. (Take Tylenol only as directed.) HOWEVER, if Aleve works for you and does not cause and you any digestive upset, go for it.  

I have a prescription to take 1 antianxiety 2X per day, but unless I am in (or will be in) a situation that calls for me to be calm and collected, I only take 1 per day. If I am at home or I do not have any major responsibilities do deal with, I just allow myself to have a little more anxiety. When I'm at home and safe, It's easier for me to deal with anxiety, plus I tend to have less. Basically, my view about my antianxiety meds is take one and reserve the second only if really needed. - Since you like peppermint tea and it has a calming effect for you, maybe drink a cup of peppermint tea instead of taking that second Xanax.

I do not know much about salt tabs. But if a person get and keeps low blood sugar because of anxiety, I'd be dead. I would have no blood sugar at all. Ask you doc if these are necessary? Maybe try to build up your blood sugar by adding a food source to your diet.

I took magnesium for years. Stopped taking it when I realized it did not do anything at all for my anxiety or sleep. over the years I've discovered that in order for supplements to truly make a difference with something as serious as anxiety and sleep issues, you would need to take massive doses, and taking massive doses of any supplement is very dangerous to our health. Supplements are really just diet gap fillers. Again, if you feel you need magnesium, add a food source that's high in magnesium to your diet.

NAC - Again, I do not think this is necessary. Actually, I read that NAC is naturally made in the body and taking it as a supplement can be unsafe for some people. Taking NAC to try and help one problem can cause problems with something else. I also have rapid repetitive thoughts, and have tried many supplements. No supplement has made a difference for these symptoms. Your peppermint tea would probably be beneficial for your repetitive thoughts also.  

Coffee - 2 cups of caffeinated in the morning only. If you want more coffee, drink decaffeinated. No caffeine after lunch. Also, only drink decaffeinated sodas.

Peppermint tea, now that's a great idea. There is also chamomile tea. There are many beneficial teas that contain a lot of the supplements you take, and these teas are a healthy food source. 

From all my experience, just my two cents. - Good luck

Thank you, I'm working on keeping track of my needs better and this way I enjoy it. 
I have significantly cut back, and I'm still making an effort. It's not so much the caffeine as it something that I enjoy.  I'm working on finding a good decaf to help cut back on the caffeine in take.  It's a work in progress. 
Thank you for your feed back, I've been on this cocktail for about two moths it's been smooth for the most part but like I said doses and meds change with my cycles unfortunately. I have been thinking about not using the aleve and going to tylenol, I have scoliosis so the aleve also helps with joint issues.  But none of this is set in stone just my current journal entry. 
I had a similar habit, and had to cut back because of GI issues. I changed to green tea, and it now also gives me a "wellness" feeling.


Your welcome. I get it. Everyone has to figure out what works best for them. 

I meant to say something about your journal entry before. I enjoyed the way you express yourself with pictures. You are very talented.
10/26 marked 2 years since the last time I self injured. I still have some issues that aren't really self injury but are somewhat self destructive like compulsively picking and filing my finger nails when I'm anxious, but I am proud to say that after turning about half of the total skin on my left forearm into scar tissue over a number of years I have now made it over 2 years without an incident.

It hasn't been easy, but doing thing to keep myself distracted has helped me get through times where I wasn't sure I could avoid it. I've been eating healthier, exercising, trying to be social, talking to people when I need to vent, and strictly following my prescribed medication plan. 

Overall this past year has probably been the best year of my life, even though I have spent the whole year alone in a house instead of living with friends or working.  I had surgery to fix the massive hole in my septum from cocaine abuse, I spent 4 months in physical therapy for my back, I quit smoking, I have stayed drug and alcohol free, I have lost over 60lbs since April, I have stayed SI free even when things got hard, and overall my mood has just been better.

I'm no sure why I'm sharing this today, but because I spend my time completely alone I just wanted to share this with someone else.

Stay strong everyone.
That's awesome. I'm proud of you. Brilliant username btw. 
Go you! It sounds like you're on a great path, it's awesome that you've made so much progress. :) I wonder if being on your own has maybe played a role in how far you've come - sometimes getting comfortable with ourselves is the best way to get healthier. :)
A great congratulations is in order! On the 15th of October, I hit my 6 year drug free mark. So proud of you! It's hard to accomplish these things, but stay strong! xx
Good job! That isn't easy and it's worth being proud of. 
That is awesome!  You should feel so proud of yourself  :)  
Hey, awesome job! I'm proud of you :)
Congratulations!!! 
You are an inspiration!!! Good luck for the future! 
Legend! congrats.

Thank you! I was struggling to put into words why I felt vastly uncomfortable while watching this show, but the article nailed it. 

I appreciate you posting it, especially since it's a pretty unpopular opinion (I've seen more than a few links to negative articles about this show get downvoted to hell). Now I'm armed with a better response if the show comes up again in discission. 
Good article but I have to disagree on two major points being the revenge and suicide scene. 

The revenge point is talked about a lot of people but I don't see it. I never got the feeling that she did it for revenge, she was going to kill herself either way, which if I recall she makes a point of saying. Her intentions were to let the people who led her to suicide know how and why, in order to hopefully prevent those actions in the future. She didn't even intend for Bryce to get caught, because unless someone told, which she seemed to assume nobody would, or didn't pass on or finish the tapes, then it would remain a secret between those people. If she wanted to get actual revenge she would have simply released it to the world instead of keeping it a secret. I can sort of understand why people might come to this conclusion but at the same time I think the show does an excellent job of not glorifying, immortalizing, or romanticizing it by showing us all the pain that the people left behind felt, and not just because of the tapes. 

This point confuses me as well. Showing the scene was bold and it was needed, the world needs to be shocked by this for people to understand the gravity of it. You say you're a trained professional but I also work in the mental health field and this did not shake me as badly as some. I'm not sure people who are suicidal or actively thinking of suicide, I don't believe this would make them want to commit suicide more, if anything it might scare them a bit, it was scary for me and I've been that depressed and contemplated suicide in the past (though not in a while, admittedly). Ultimately I think it had far more positive effects then negative ones and while we should still discuss those negative aspects for some people, I don't think we can discount the good ones, which you did not do and I appreciate that so thank you. I value your opinion as a medical professional and was glad to see your input, even though we disagree. 
I don't think anyone has yet pointed out how the show gets viewers to dwell on negative emotional states, even if only vicariously through the characters, but for anyone who's going through similar situations, the show will encourage empathy here and reliving their negative experiences.  

This will certainly have a negative impact on many people's lives. Another less charitable way of putting this is the show preys upon vulnerable viewers to trick their emotional centers with exaggerated displays of emotions and events to get them to keep watching​ the show and talk about it with others. 
Great article. I agree with you. It was a great show but for me that suicide scene was completely overwhelming to the point I was in tears. It affected me for days. 
I really liked this show with great acting and plot. What I found really disheartening is that the main protagonists were actually the 2 more sane people in that school, the rest were real jerks. I found her to be a likable and popular character surrounded by a 'cult of insensitive evil people, not a real school. I did not find that relatable to reality.

My first impression was that of revenge, though the price she had to pay (her life) at the last episode really changed my whole perspective. It was not revengeful, she just wanted to tell the truth. If other can't handle the truth it's their problem.
As others have already said, thank you. I haven't finished the series because I had a lot of similar feelings. I especially agree about the links to help resources for people triggered by the show - they are so important. 


I do agree strongly with the suicide for revenge part. It seems weird. I've never heard of someone who is suicidal or tried to commit suicide for revenge. If you're out for revenge you'd rather end up homicidal, maybe both homicidal and suicidal, and end up as a shooter or something similar. But the act of killing yourself for revenge seems a little unrealistic.
Thank you for sharing this. As a clinician I also found myself watching the show as a way to stay in the know with clients AND to help navigate between what was portrayed accurately and inaccurately. I have several teenage clients coming into session talking about this show and I wanted to be able to have conversations about it with them. Thank you again- I will be sharing this with other clinicians I know!
So, somehow in my ADHD-vyvanse induced focus, coupled with a strong desire to avoid more studying for final exams, I ended up typing a response on my phone to the show, the article, and public opinions of the show. Given the state of mind I'm currently in, I will go ahead and apologize for wordiness, circular points, or incoherent rambling that might be found in the response, but I hope that some of you will still skim through it at least as I'd really love to discuss the different interpretations of the show and how they may play out with regards to viewer impact. I also would love it if any psychologists, psychiatrists, or similar medical professionals could chime in on some basis for my interpretation and updated validity of suicide statistics and information.

Anyways, because it's so long, I'm going to split it up in the comments to this.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read it. I really appreciate your feedback and am happy to give you a different perspective!

As someone who read the book during the worst possible time in my life, not fully realizing what I was doing, I can truly say that the show has a potential to convince those on the edge to commit. After reading the book I felt justified in killing myself and started writing my goodbye letters. Don't assume because you have a tough upper lip that teens and young adults are going to be able to digest this content the same way. Especially if they're already volatile. I refuse to watch the show, and it gave my friend who was in the other room while their roommate watched it a panic attack from memories of their own rape.
My husband and I both watched this, and we both loved it. I've struggled with depression and suicide for years, so I was mixed when I heard friends on both sides saying not to watch this as well as saying it was amazing. I'm glad I did.

I don't understand the upset over the suicide. I have sat and considered all the ways of suicide that would be the most effective, and I knew that slitting my wrists would work if I could do it right. After watching this show and seeing how painful and hard it was to do (what I imagine it to be), it has eradicated all thoughts of suicide from my mind since seeing it. I feel the trauma and negativity of her suicide were absolutely necessary.

I also feel that one thing that was left out of this article was how well this series showed the impact of her suicide. Suicidal people think they're just a burden and that they're helping others by ending their life. Clearly we see that Hannah's parents are devastated by the loss, and Clay is hurt even before he gets the tapes. With the impact of the tapes, we hope that Hannah's bullies will become better people. We'd like the school to step up and be better about supporting their students (stopping bullies, emotional support/suicide prevention, etc).

Unfortunately I know that nothing really changes. I went to a large school where I was heavily bullied and our counselors were worse than Mr Porter. We had students die from various things over the years (car accidents, eating disorders, drunk driving, suicide, etc), and all we ever got was an announcement on the intercom that morning stating that someone had passed from a certain grade - sometimes that was the first many of us were hearing about it.

Hell one time I got sent to the counselor for breaking down crying at the end class (my first early warning sign for my depression). I was asked why I was crying and if there was something wrong - was I sad? Which I wasn't sad and technically there wasn't anything wrong. I had no idea why I started crying. The counselor basically wrote it off as female hormones and sent me back to class. I didn't realize that I was cracking due to the stress of school, work, clubs, etc. Turns out you can just start crying over that kind of thing even though you're not sad. I was not aware of that at the time. For a large school, we had horrible counselors and no mental health education or resources.

It surprises me that there aren't more Hannahs when we're still too afraid to discuss mental health as anything more than a problem in the US. I went to a large school and we should have had the resources. I've talked to family and friends with kids in smaller schools, and they don't have the resources at all (barely a guidance counselor). Everyone talks about Mr Porter being one poor example, but I really think we need to look at this more as a situation where Mr Porter is the normal. Those of you mental health professionals watching the show and being proactive about your students/clients are the abnormal good ones. Mental health education needs to be a more interactive part of normal school curriculum, not stigmatized and avoided.

Maybe instead of being so pissed over the couple things this show did wrong, we should be thrilled that someone made a show addressing mental health, bullying, rape, etc, and it's actually popular. Every movie or TV show gets things wrong. I'd much rather focus on what it does right.
Thank you so much! It's always good to hear other perspectives and interpretations. I appreciate your feedback and thoughts!

I am sorry to hear that. It means you have a lot of empathy! I appreciate your support and taking the time to read the article :) 
Thank you for sharing! Yes, I agree that maybe the aspect of telling her perspective on things and her truth stood out for many people! I have had a few clients share that as well. 
Thank you so much! Would love to hear your feelings about the show once you finish. I appreciate you taking the time to read! 
Yes, the scary part is having children think that if they mimic this that they too will get "revenge." Thankfully, most of my teenage clients dont like that aspect of the show!

Thank you so much for reading and for sharing. It's such an important topic especially for kids!

The show does a pretty good job of showing how much of a downturn, though, the lives of those who cared about her took, and I think that's objectively more important than arguing whether there is a basis for believing the show glorifies suicide as a revenge tactic. She cared about her parents and Clay, there was never a question about that, and because of that, it seemed like she took a lot of effort to hide things from them. After the fact, they don't know how to really move on, and I firmly believe that in the situation that someone was to come forward to those that cared about and watched as their heart broke for them, it would definitely put some hesitation in going through with it and contributing to breaking their heart even more. That's why it was highlighted that her parents didn't expect it or Clay not knowing about anything, because she made the effort to hide it to make it easier for her. Arguably, viewers get to empathize with the loved ones in a way that almost demonizes suicide.

As for the actual suicide scene, I'm still torn. It was gruesome. I almost threw up, and I was shaking for 30 minutes after the episode had ended. For me though, it wasn't the blood or the cutting that caused that though. It was the immense pain that was invoked in me when they show her eyes. Or the pure hopelessness that you can't help but to feel for her when through the blood and the physical pain she still sees no other option but to continue and cut her other wrist. It was shocking; it was gross; it was raw; it was scary; and it was definitely bloody. But it was not unnecessary. It was not only meant for shock value. Going back to what I said earlier, the actual suicide attempt is often done within a small window of time surrounding the actual decision. Everything prior to that is a thought, a potential plan, a possibility, a believed solution. But it's not a definite. It's not a decision. It's not final. And because of that, we never see how someone feels when it becomes a definite -- when negativity, depression, and hopelessness take the wheel and make the decision. How can we understand someone in the situation without knowing what the final moments were? How can we recognize how horrible circumstances must be to believe that killing yourself is the only thing you can do? Because, until it happens, until it becomes real, we only know the feelings and the story and the life of someone who is still fighting to live, at least slightly. We never get to know the person who has completely given up. The actual scene, in my opinion, gives us a glimpse into this. It makes everything prior to seeing it somehow more real, more burdensome, more consequential. 

Just a few final thoughts and then I'll wrap it up. Despite our disagreements, I would actually really love to get more insight into the nuances of the counter points for what I said. I don't want to assert anything as true or factual or all encompassing with that I said, so much as I want to both provide my thoughts and let other people see how I interpreted everything, and therefore give them a firm basis to disagree and show me otherwise. I do, however, agree that suicide prevention organizations/hotlines should be shown at the start of every episode. It may annoy some people or seem unnecessary, but with the subject matter, it needs to be explicitly stated that there a resource for people who may need help. It can only be a positive addition. Finally, one of the big reasons I am averse to posts and articles degrading 13 Reasons Why based on the supposed belief that it glorifies suicide is because a lot of people that I see posting about it don't seem to have any experience with suicidal ideation or with friends who have been suicidal or have committed suicide. It always seems like their heart is in the right place in trying to prevent people from making life changing or life ending decisions, but to act as if the nuances of being in such a situation can be boiled down to "don't watch this because of what it really means if you're suicidal" is somewhat ignorant. Maybe it has a negative impact on some, but maybe it also encourages others to reflect on their actions to others or seek help for their own problems. Assuming how it will be widely interpreted from an outside perspective is counterproductive to the discussions that the show could bring about, and discouraging it's viewing has the potential to do more harm to the discussion than it does to help.
I'm sure this is probably just an amalgam of all the feedback you got, as I found some thoughts among both the agreeing and dissenting posts in this thread alone being similar to what I'm about to try to convey with regards to my experience watching the show, as well as my opinions on it. Regardless, I appreciate you posting this and providing your thoughts so as to have a discussion on the show in this setting, since, if they've happened before, I have missed them.

The first thing I want to say is that we're in agreement on the way that it portrays this taboo topic of real bullying in schools. Growing up (I'm only 22, which makes this a fairly relevant experience to modern day), most of the media that I consumed depicted bullying as mostly physical. If not entirely physical, the rest usually came off as childish and outright name calling, even when depicting older students, that does not remotely even begin to hold a candle to what really goes on. Most bullying is indirect comparatively -- today's bullying is rumors and spiteful hallway glances. It's exposed secrets and toxic friendships. It's slowly losing friends because different groups deem you not good enough to be apart of the crowd; meanwhile, your former best friend fades into their activities and seems to blame you for the now failing friendship. There's so much more to it than anyone ever talks about, and I think 13 reasons Why was a good way to start that conversation with it's popularity. 

Unfortunately, I haven't seen much continuation in the discussions that need to happen. It failed in highlighting the small things that build up that negatively affect kids, because with the intent of the show, you couldn't talk about it. It's the actions of 13 people that have taken Hannah to where she is mentally, and trying to highlight the smaller things would've been seen as a detractor to the central premise. But even so, the big things mentioned seem to get glossed over in school systems because, quite frankly, they're seen as too uncomfortable to talk about. It's sad that teachers and administrators would rather downplay bullying or depict it in the misleading way media does, or, if I may, turning to focus on to one form of bullying as they've done with cyber bullying, than stand in front of kids and discuss how the words slut, cunt, pussy, bitch, and whore affect people. Or the conditions of most rapes (e.g. Done by someone you know). Or LGBT slurs and violence. Or drugs and alcohol. The most they want to do is say "don't do it," and have the time, they can't even bring themselves to say the word they're talking about. Hell, some places who do have programs to discuss these issues do so through the sole medium of a sectioned internet course that throws facts, figures, and impersonal scenarios at its users as if that really makes a difference. In my opinion, this show did more to open up the floor to discuss these thing than any poster, social media, video, or school campaign has ever done, because it depicts things in a raw manner, moving forward though, focus needs to encompass the small things, however, which is where I find the show seems to be disappointing in its portrayal.
Next, I'll concede that I understand, or at least think that I do, the concerns and the thought processes of those worried about the the glorification of suicide as a means to exact revenge on harassers and bullies and society in general. However, I entirely disagree with this being in legitimate concern regarding the show's potential effects. I will say I am not a mental health profession like you, so I am very open to hearing why my thoughts or interpretations may be wrong or uninformed. Most of what I'm going to say will be a brief summary of my analysis of the story and characters, combined with what I've learned from QPR training and other suicide prevention seminars I've attended, as well as articles and studies I've read pertaining to the topic throughout the past few years.

If I'm not mistaken in my recall, something like 90% of suicide attempts are done within an hour or two of the sudden decision to go through with it. I've been told that the decision is very much an instantaneous thing in the majority of cases. That isn't to say, however, that they haven't thought about plenty of times, even come up with a plan for actually doing it prior to the decision, just that the decision to go through with it is often independent of prior thoughts. This is one part of why I disagree with the concern over the show's glorification of suicide (which I wouldn't even call it a glorification, personally). It seems to me that nothing about the show, especially while watching it, would impel the spur of the moment decision to commit suicide for someone who had previously thought about it. At the very least, it definitely wouldn't do so with promises of revenge.

In all the seminars I've attended, as well as the testimonies of survivors, one thing has stood out to me, and that was that it's not usually just one thing that leads someone to believe suicide is their only or best choice (in Hannah's case it was 13 things, or, arguably, 12 things leading to the thoughts and 1 thing finalizing her decision), and the moments or days leading up to the attempt are often almost carefree (at least according to some survivors). I don't know how widespread these trends actually are or how often they're observed, but I think they definitely provide a fair amount of disconnect between people who may be considering suicide and Hannah on the TV show, especially given that we live her life through memories after the event, and not as it leads up to it. Basically, what I'm getting at is that with the show happening post suicide, there's little chance for someone to walk with Hannah through her journey as she comes to the realization that suicide is what she feels she has to do. If that were the case, I might be inclined to agree with the concerns, because it may lead already hurt and vulnerable individuals to consider a thought they've likely had previously in more depth as the show brings up or triggers memories from their own life. As it stands, however, the show seems to balance a showing of Hannah's downward spiral and reasoning and the tragic aftermath of her death(specifically with regards to her family and Clay).

Another thing is that discussing suicide, displaying suicide, or, in any way, presenting suicide does not sway individuals toward such a path if they previously had no intention or thoughts of it. The show can't really convince someone that suicide is a good way to get revenge if someone never felt that it was an option. If someone had felt it was an option, I fail to see how suggesting killing yourself to get back at someone would mesh with their personal turmoil and outlook on life if their previous thoughts of suicide had nothing to do with revenge. 

Further, I would assert that she didn't kill herself out of revenge, not in the way the story was told at least. It's pretty obvious that her character just can't bare to be exposed to that anymore. I would think for someone in a similar situation, the thoughts of suicide wouldn't ever be to spite people who have wronged her (plenty of other methods of doing that) but rather to no longer have to deal with the potential of future wrongs. In my mind, it seems like thoughts would be  "I can't handle what's been going on as it is now, I can't imagine going on and things getting worse. Why subject myself to that?" 

Finally (for this portion anyways), I understand how people view the tapes as a matter of revenge, but to some extent, I imagined her creation of them was part of her figuring out how her life had gotten to where it was, rather than being for the sole purpose of assigning postmortem blame. If that was the case, a letter would've sufficed, or the tapes could've been public initially or plenty of other options which would've been about the blame. The tapes however tell a story that just happens to be one that can be viewed as blame. Further, the tapes for the most part, in being private, are moreso about making people reflect on their individual actions as they don't have control over others. They couldn't have stopped her suicide if they hadn't focused on being better themselves, and they can't blame the other people on the tape for her suicide either because they contributed as well. In that regard, I think the show is a positive, as it does highlight things that people are guilty of and says "look, here's what your words/actions can lead to."
Thank you for your feedback and taking the time to read my article. I cant seem to find your other comments for some reason other then this one however! 
Reading and watching are completely different mediums and don't have the same effect. None of the rape scenes occur in a way that is a surprise to the viewer, and by that I mean that the show gives ample time and example before the rape scenes are shown, so anyone watching who is sensitive to that subject or the subject of suicide in general shouldn't watch it if they don't think they can handle it. Netflix announced that they will be putting disclaimers and warnings before the beginning of particularly gruesome episodes as well. This show is mostly meant to reach the audience of people who don't fully realize what bullying and rape can do to a person nor what the co sequences of suicide are, I'm not sure it was ever really geared toward suicidal people or rape victims.
Of course suicide impacts other people. But that's not its purpose or an arguement against it.

It's hard to imagine for me how "just" suicide can destroy a whole life, but I can see how it can deeply affect some. The worst case I can really imagine is suicide causing a trauma or suicidal ideation in the affected person themself.
I think they mean that if someone killed you because you did something wrong, you're dead. But if someone you know kills themselves because of something you did, that will have a life-long effect. My sister's friend had to go through this. Her ex threatened to kill himself because she wouldn't get back with him. She said no, and then he did it. It took years to cope with that mental devastation. 

this is pretty much where i'm at right now.  unfortunately i desperately need the money so i have to work but each day is getting harder and harder.
Same here. We just have to keep pushing through. I contemplate quitting work almost everyday and I fear that one day when I'm depressed or manic, I might do it on impulse and not realize what I'm doing until it's too late. 
I'm fortunate enough to work for a company who works with me on my issues. They got me set up with medical leave time. I just had to get some paperwork filled out by my doctor. If you have a disability and you live in the US, legally your employer has to make accommodations for you. I have had these accommodations at previous jobs too and I have noticed that once you do get them, some employers look for other ways to get rid of you. It's pretty fucked up. I left those jobs until I found one who understands. It's rough, but accommodating managers are out there. 
It's a simillar situation with my university... But there's "no excuses" here. 
I am currently working for one of the few employers who understand and they work with me. At first i tried dealing with it on my own until i got on a new medication, i warned my employers and he reduced my days and works my schedule around me, and on the days when i am at very low points he is understanding if i have to call in. I am beyond blessed with him, but am not making enough money for all my work and now am in a position to decide  to leave for a higher paying job with an unknown employer or stay with my current and know im safe in my job /:
You are really lucky for finding such an understanding employer and also lucky to be working in US. I live in Lithuania (Northren Europe) and there are nothing like that here

Good one
That's a great article. Really gives someone who has never experienced depression an idea of what it might be like for someone who has. Also, the idea that the word "depression" is used so lightly was an interesting observation. Sort of like when I was kid we always used to say "that's so gay" to mean "that's so stupid" or something of the sort. Of course, no one says that anymore, and maybe that will happen with the word "depression" as well. One can hope.


"A federally funded survey of more than 9,000 people in 2004 estimated that half of Americans will meet the criteria for a mental disorder in their lives, with the first onset usually in childhood or adolescence."


This needs to be taught everywhere.  How many of us suffer and make those around us suffer because we go untreated?  If more people end up,being treated we might just get this mental health crisis under control.

When I recently went back to school and was having anxiety issues, I was told(in a manner that kkeps them clean from legal action) that it would be best if I withdrew. There was no effort by anyone to direct me towards help. Just a 'get the fuck outta here' attitude. And this was even though my grades were fine.
That's insane. I'm glad this is getting publicity, holding universities publically accountable for their actions is the only way this changes.


My university experience was the complete opposite. I grew up in a rural area where there was a strong stigma against mental illness, and I think college was the only place I would have ever had a chance of getting the right treatment. They had affordable (and extremely patient) therapists and psychiatrists, and multiple people from various departments (disabilities resources, and the engineering dept advisors) who wanted to help me succeed. They really made a difference for me.


That said, like the article stated, many schools have a problem with hiding rape. That and suicide are things that are purposely ignored even though those problems aren't going to get better by ignoring them. Not to mention universities can sometimes be a cold academic environment, where both students and professors consider grades more important than maintaining healthy habits or sanity. That's unrealistic and just asking for trouble. 
Feels like these stories (and there are quite a few of them, and with many of the same schools coming up again and again) are much worse PR then a student committing suicide. It's impossible not to blame the school for this sort of treatment, but at least a lot of the people reading about a student's suicide would realize it isn't the school's fault.

This is what I have been thinking/struggling with for some time. Often when you have depression you can begin to think it's "your fault" or "why can't I just be stronger?" "Why can't I be more resilient?" etc. Even some people close to me try to ask me to "try harder" to not feel down.. but that's the thing it's not a flaw in characters, it is some chemistry in our brains so it is often so difficult for that reason.

I really like this, it was definitely of some comfort, thank you so much for sharing it.
That's great. Thank you.
Isn't character nothing more than chemistry?

Thank you so much, often I think I personally (and perhaps others) lose sight of the fact that other people feel this way too... tendency to blame ourselves and feel completely alone, like we're the only ones in the world feeling this way, so thank you for reminding me I am not the only one that has thought these things.

I am really sorry that you were the only one in your family that it was passed down to, I can imagine that must be frustrating but I hope you can find a silver lining of some sort.. maybe it can somehow make you a deeper person by going through the hardships we go through and coming out the other side, you can also empathize with others who experience the same feelings. =)

This is really good though, the quote and I think I will also use it when I am trying to explain it to anyone. I put it on my FB and my mother saw it and agreed which is was nice.

Good luck to you also, will always keep fighting and for sure - we've got this! =)

"We're trying, I swear we're trying"... 
That part really hit me. Ive been dealing with mental illness for several years now. When I think of the damage I'm doing to my kids I feel so guilty. I try not to. I spend as much time as I can with my kids. I dont want to hurt them. They have seen me at my absolute worst. I never know what to tell them about my illness. They know that dad is sick. That dad can't deal with things anymore. That dad hides. That dad is prone to outburst. He say hurtful things that he probably doesn't mean. He can get angry. I shelter my kids as best as I can. But ultimately I'm protecting them from myself.

What's so amazing about this is its authenticity and rawness. It's so real. People should be easy on those dealing with depression but those with depression should be easy on themselves. 
This made me cry. It's so beautiful,but in a painful and authentic way. 
I hate it the only time I cry due to anxiety but any time when I hit depressive  episode I am numb tired, I feel dumbed down to care, I want to stay in bed cause it feels I have no energy to care. People call you, you don't care and your partner wants you to make a decision on things but you have no idea wtf you want. You think of death constantly, you wonder if your just being lazy whimp! You lose interest in goals, hobbies and just life! Just feel like you're existing just for the sake of it!

Hello. My name is Pete. 

I have decided to do a daily video blog about my stay in psychiatric hospital. Today has been a good day and i think i have got across what i wish to achieve in these videos. Some days, my meds will mess me up a bit so whether you are watching to see what its like being inside the walls of a mental health institution, to see a patient ramble off his tits or to follow the path i want which is for us to share experiences and help each other by sharing things we have learnt in the past, that is all up to you.

Please feel free to message me in the comments and i will try my best to reply. I do not think many people have done what i am doing before so maybe this blog will give insight to a highly mysterious and much misunderstood world.

Every so often I may bring a friend along to join in the daily video either a visitor or a patient. But we shall see how that goes. Life can be tricky sometimes. Especially when your brain starts going one way and the real you (some people call it your soul) goes the other way. 

I want to talk about a mixture of plain and simple things like what i get up to in here and who and what keeps me going along with my philosophical ideas on life, human nature and what we need to do to become happier within ourselves as ultimately, thats what we all yearn for 

Much love, have a wonderful day x
Please check out the second video if liked the first

Thank you for doing this. I look forward to watching future videos. Peace, Tim in Boston.
Crazy amount of courage Pete.  Definitely impressed and proud of you.  Your videos are intriguing and informative in a way I've never seen before.  I wish you the best and I'm looking forward to learning more about you.  
just watched your first vid. Great that you are doing this.
Your honesty is beautiful and these videos are incredible and inspiring. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Good luck with everything you do. 
As a guy who suffers from MD episodes, and has worked in a mental ward....more power to ya
Pete, you inspire me. Overcoming mental illness takes resolve and strength. You seem to personify both those attributes. God bless! 
Currently on a wait list for an inpatient program (Panic Disorder), thanks for doing this. Interesting to see the perspective from someone currently inside.
Can I say that I actually got shivers down my spine while watching? This is amazing. Thank you for what you're doing. 
Thanks am so glad you this its amazing, episode 8. is now uploaded :) Head over to my channel xxx

I hate how we make humans into a commodity, just as soon as we can.
😳 wow
I had her diary that her husband published. (Kinda intrusive) Reading it became more and more depressing even thinking back to reading it is doing it. It's thick. I got about halfway through...skipped to the end and there was an editors note saying that the last few months were too personal. I haven't thought of that diary in years. I left it in my rotting  closet when I moved. I wish I had it back. The weirdest damn thing was reading "The Bell Jar" inspired me to start smoking weed again after not doing it for 4 years. Since I moved I don't smoke anywhere near as much as I did and barely drink. But it's not a good thing. I do tons of other drugs. Dammit I want my book back (and yes it is intrusive)
The dead have no "rights".  Legally at least. However I think this is tawdry which is something the dead do have a right not  be.  

Edit:  The dead can't sue or file charges

>The dead have no "rights"

So, then I can eat a dead body in front of that persons kids then?
No,   that would be desecrating/mutilating a corpse.   Thats not a crime against the corpse.   Its a crime against society. 

You would definitely get a trip to the psych ward though.
I checked myself in thinking that I could leave whenever I wanted. Now a few hours later I have a plan to go to an actual mental health facility with my father tomorrow and they still won't let me go. 

It almost feels like its out of spite. Like "Oh you think you're fucked enough for this huh? Think your thoughts are too crazy? Well now you're locked in for good"  

I just can't get to a place where I actually think these quacks are trying to help me. For Pete's  sake I'm in a converted storage bay and attended to by an ER doctor who himself said he is winging it. 

I want out but I don't know how to get it. Help Reddit can they actually legally bind me here? 
If you actually said you were thinking of killing yourself, they will probably keep you. Do you have any mental health history? Where do you live? Maybe I could look up some laws.
They can legally hold you under the mental health act for 24 hours. A doctor will then assess you and they either have to section you or release you immediately. Good luck! 
I know it sucks, but they have a legal obligation. You came in and told them you wanted to kill yourself. They can't just take your word for it that you're gonna go into treatment elsewhere tomorrow. If they released you w/o being thorough, and you actually *did* do something in an attempt to kill yourself, they could be held liable. 
you get out by agreeing with them and telling them theyre right and that youre wrong and thinking more clearly about thee situation now that youve had space to breathe.
source: got the tshirt.
I just want to post that it isn't a mistake to go to the ER or the hospital if you believe you are a threat to yourself or may become one pretty quickly. I feel like this post might discourage others from going and if you are in that position it really is the better alternative. 

OP I'm sorry you're stuck, but I'm glad you didn't go through with what you were thinking about. You'll pull through. Good luck.

Here's a couple of OR laws I found.

It sucks, I've been in your shoes and was admitted basically involuntarily.  But I knew I needed the help.  If I were you I'd just play the game until they let you out.  Or tell them that unless they're going to get someone in to hold you down and keep you from leaving you want to go.  Then get up and walk out.

Just a month ago now I was laying in the ER waiting for the pills I took to work their way out of my system.  I was prepared to walk out of there wearing nothing but the hospital gown and go home.  Thankfully I had a great friend who agreed to watch over me that night so they let me out.  See if you know anyone who can do that for you.
ER - the point is to keep you not dead for 72 hours or so and get you pointed at or shipped to psych help as needed.

The only mistake I think people make here, is if they already know they have a MH problem, and know they want help. At that point, they should choose between going to psych hospital as the first step, or making an appointment with psychologist or psychiatrist whichever preference.

Still, you'll get where you need to go, just try to relax.  You didn't pick the fastest way to get there, but you didn't pick the slowest either.
If you checked in with a suicide plan in mind, most states require an ER > acute psyche setup to hold one for 72 hours. OR is one of them. BT, DT. Not the end of the world, though I admit, it may seem to be when one is in extremis. Take it easy and enjoy the ride. And get help for whatever threw your train off the tracks. If you want a road map for that, give me a little background so I can steer in the right direction. (OR, btw, is one of the very *best* states in This Great Land of Ours to be mentally ill.) 
> Now a few hours later I have a plan to go to an actual mental health facility with my father tomorrow and they still won't let me go.

Once you sign yourself in to an emergency room as suicidal they are legally responsible for your safety. The emergency room though can work with the mental health facility in question and arrange to have an ambulance transport you to it. Either that or if you talk to your doctor in the ER about the situation he may be willing to release you to the custody of your father for the purposes of transport to that facility if he feels comfortable that you'll be safe.
Legally (& medically) if the healthcare provider believes you are either a threat to yourself or a threat to others, they are required to hospitalize you.

 I know it may feel like you were open and honest and now being "punished" for it, but just trust that the doctors and staff are on your side. They are doing this with your best interest in mind. It sounds like you are doing ok, so you'll be out of there in no time. Hope you feel better :) 
I did the same thing. Checked myself into the ER for suicidal thoughts. They were really touch and go with me. 5 hours later they arranged for me to go to the psych unit. I was relieved at the thought of getting real help there. Instead, one of the doctors talked to me for 5 minutes, acted slightly rude, diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder, and left. This was on my second day. I was growing increasingly frustrated that I hadn't had a chance to get help, just to sit it on group therapy about socializing and building relationships (of which I had none). I started freaking out out of frustration and raising my voice asking for someone to just sit down and talk with me for a while, just help me, the doctor told me to calm the hell down. They were passing out benzodiazepines like candy but he refused one for me and told me "If you don't feel like anyone is helping you here than just leave. I'll call your contact and have them come pick you up. Get your things ready."

TLDR: I got kicked out of the psych ward on day 2 of a 72 hour observation when I was suicidal because I was upset that no one was actually trying to provide me any help or talk to me about why I was there in the first place.
I've been where you are before a few times.  It feels like shit, but (not to sound like a broken record) does get better.
I was brought to the ER twice by ambulance. Second time I nearly made it through. But when I was conscious and able to breathe again I was untied from the hospital bed and allowed to go home. Which I thought was pretty strange, as they obviously could not have thought it was merely a cry for attention ending up in such a life-threatening state. My parents came to pick me up though, which probably played a role in it as well, even though I was already an adult at that time. I remember the doctor having a small chat with me when I woke up. She held my hand and told me it would be alright.

Luckily I never got admitted involuntary. I got close though. Police showed up at my door a couple of times. But if I agreed to commit myself they said no court order would be issued. I stayed at three mental hospitals so far, but even while on suicide watch I could stay voluntary.

One time I had a conversation with one of my therapists, and apparently she thought I was a danger to myself. She then gave me the choice to either get admitted to a mental hospital for four weeks for a so-called crisis stay, or they would call a law doctor to force me to stay. I stayed for one night and just could not handle it. They told me there was a 90 % chance I would be forced into admittance by court of they called one of these doctors, but I took the change as being so isolated killed me inside. Doctor came to evaluate me, along with two police officers to keep watch. I got really lucky and was able to talk me out of it. If I was deemed a threat to myself then I would have had to stay for 10 days, go to court, and if receiving another negative evaluation it would become 40 days. Which afterwards can be prolonged again. But that is just the way it works where I live.

All of this made me very cautious. I just find it so ridiculous that it is sometimes so unclear about what you can or cannot say and to whom. Seems as if it sometimes just comes down to the person, hospital or mental institute in particular. For example, if my current psychiatrist knows I have suicidal thoughts, she will not immediately contact the police, because she knows me and she knows when things get serious. However, if I would be sent to some random ER, and they would read my medical records, I most likely would be fucked.
Sympathies for the OP.

Just to reassure people in the UK at least - this is almost the polar opposite of how things work should anyone in crisis seek emergency assistance. Don't be put off.
Nice one

I do but nothing crazy besides this hospital visit. I live in Oregon. Ya and seems to be like the worst part. As soon as I said the words "i want to kill myself" I could tell I screwed myself. 

My own situation aside, it really puts people like myself who have been in that grey area of thinking about suicide for years just never vocalized. But you cant just show up and be like "Hey can you throw me in a barren room real quick for a few hours just to see if I do anything bad, you know just babysit me for a bit." Without incurring what honestly feels like penalization
Thank you!
I've never known anyone who didn't regret it, tbh. Feel like shit? Let's see what we can do to make it worse and on top of it you might even go home with PTSD!

If telling people the truth of their experiences will discourage people from going, then the cure may be worse than the disease and maybe people shouldn't be encouraged to go. 

EDIT This experience doesn't seem the norm in psyche emergency clinics/hospitals from what I gather. Find one of those instead!
When I've been in the ER for suicidal thoughts they always let me keep my phone (but no cables or anything). I've only had the phone taken away once being put on an actual mental health ward.
I hear ya and I'm looking forward to it. Things have gotten better in leaps and bounds since I was a kid but some things are just hard for me to shake. 

I hear ya tho buddy and here's to the future 
That's not true if we're talking US. As an adult if you are considered a risk to yourself or others you can be placed on a 72 hour hold during which you cannot leave for any reason. They don't do it out of spite, it's a safety concern. I don't know how long OP has been checked in but it's very likely they will not be allowed to leave no matter how extenuating the circumstances.

Not sure how much this applies to other nations.
I have a feeling I just got lied to then. I pressed pretty hard. Oh well my dad is going to be here in a few hours and I'm sure they will listen to the not crazy person 
I was fairly adamant about it but I'm just going to wait for a few hours until my dad gets here. I'm sure it will sound better coming from the not crazy person. Luckily I don't have any responsibilities to take care of and a good book!
If you're a minor in the US and are considered to be a risk to yourself, a parent cannot get you out.
I'm not sure if that will make things better or worse. I thought about it tho
I agree with you. I made sure I knew exactly what not to say. I'm a nurse and know how these things work. I simply went to the ER and asked if there was someone I could talk to because I have a history of severe depression and I didn't feel like I was managing things well at that moment. I never said I was going to kill myself then or at any other time in the future. I was still treated like trash and locked in a room and never spoke to a doctor for six hours. Lab technicians in training took turns trying to draw my blood. There has never been a problem drawing my blood before. It was so surreal that I started crying, and then shut down and was silent for a while. 
After a bit, I became very calm and lucid and began asking the nurse questions. I found that all of my lab work was normal, and asked her to show me any proof of where I said I had suicidal intentions. She could not, and said she was calling the attending to see me immediately for discharge as I didn't seem to be in any danger. It literally took six hours, and when I explained everything to the doctor she apologized profusely and said she didn't think it was an emergency that she come see me. I told her that I was a nurse and do understand how ERs work, but that I was falsely held and ignored for the majority of the time. They let me go without any recommendations for seeking help for depression at all. I still don't know what to do about that experience. I paid for and received my medical records of the experience.
I would think that it's probably not a good idea. As some other posters mentioned above, it's legal for them to keep you in for a certain period of time if you are determined to be a threat to your own safety and/or that of others. Meaning that calling the cops won't help and will probably just draw attention to you in a bad way. Wishing you luck though, dude. Try to stay as calm as you can, hopefully you get out soon.
Dang I wish I had known about your experience beforehand! No one has been jabbing needles into me so I've got that going for me. 

Straight up tho, something needs to be done on how these issues are communicated to health care providers. I understand that there certain people who say they are fine then go off and kill themselves instantly but maybe part of the reason the do so is the slightly dehumanizing experience of being admitted as a mental health patient. 

All being said, it's a far cry from AHS asylum lol 
I wish I could have told you. It was very dehumanizing. I've only ever been treated this way regarding mental health. 
When I get report from other nurses when I am at work, if the person has a mental illness it is usually mentioned in a negative light, but their other "health problems" like morbid obesity, diabetes and complete medical noncompliance are seen as valid concerns. It's idiotic. 
I'm surprised they are letting you have your phone. When I went in they took everything from me, even my clothes. Good luck!! 

science is a liar sometimes. 
Wow. That's helpful.

My personal cycle is

    Feel anxious about failing my assessment
    Put off my assessment
    Do worse because I run out of time
    Believe I can't succeed
This is really great!
God this makes me anxious...
It's almost like the more you fight anxiety, the more it fights you.
I enjoyed this very much. The section about self esteem made me rethink the way I think about self esteem. 

I described this to my girlfriend today as having a corrosive touch. What is strange is not knowing how to feel the positive feedback one might get doing something right. Most commonly I get this from my work in photography. When I get a compliment I get nothing. No response behind my eyes. When I go through a set I and get nothing to work with, I feel that. 
My brother always pokes fun of me about having anxiety over the inevitability of my having anxiety. I have anxiety about having anxiety... har har brother, lemme tell you that shits hilarious! /s
Did you listen to the Iprocrastinate podcast? It's pretty interesting offers a lot of insight to why we are procrastinating. 
Oh no, do you have a link?
http://iprocrastinate.libsyn.com/

It's a lot of podcast. I recently started at the very beginning. 

Good for you! It looks beautiful.

I *love* traveling alone. Some people might think it would be weird/lonely but there's something really freeing and peaceful about it.
The ability to go where you want and when you want makes you feel powerful and in control. 
I took an impromptu 8 hour drive to Niágara falls with a budget of only $100 and it was one of the best things I ever did for myself 
You are stuck in your own mind, but thinking about things you want to think about. 

Anything can matter though. If you are a victim of abuse, it may have mattered to the abuser. It didn't need to matter is much more of a heartfelt sentiment.  

I'm interested about your statement about suicide becoming less taboo. It's an interesting idea. I'm not sure what the picture is showing though, I'm kind of confused about that. 
/r/SuicideWatch moderator here.  

I think there are two factors that we need to consider.  One is certainly the stigma surrounding suicide, especially the lingering condemnation by religious "authorities" in some segments of the population.  The other is the simple need for, *and right to*, privacy, and that will never go away.

I answer a suicide hotline IRL as well as moderating SW, and in both environments anonymity is viewed as a safety device that saves far more lives than it costs.  I wish this was better understood by the general public.  
I think people are scared to talk about suicide because exposure to it can cause pain for others who are struggling with suicide and depression. There needs to be some exposure to it, I agree. Suicides are always kept hush, hush where I am from and they never report that it was a suicide. Maybe more exposure to it and more help for the people who live where I do could change that. 
It's a post that was on /r/SuicideWatch yesterday. /r/SuicideWatch is an anonymous support group that suicidal people can post in to talk about nearly everything pertaining to their situation. The sad part is that a lot of our traffic comes from people too scared to talk to someone in real life. People who are suicidal generally feel disconnected from the world, and for whatever reason, this individual didn't feel comfortable enough to talk to people they knew personally. 

I guess, that's why it saddens me. It's not merely an intellectual problem for me anymore, I guess. If suicide were easier to talk about than it is now, then maybe this individual would have felt more comfortable talking to a friend or loved one who could have done far more than we could do last night.
I don't disagree with you, I'm just trying to wrestle with the underlying issues that lead to anonymous support in the first place. It seems to me that the only reason that anonymous support is preferred over that of a friend or family member is because the latter isn't available. Personally, the only time I can envision anonymous support being preferential is if I'm getting judged by someone who doesn't understand my circumstances, whether out of ignorance or stigma. Then I'm really alone.

I'm not saying that the group isn't doing anything good, I think it's great and necessarily. However, as you said before, it's just not ideal, and raising more awareness is the first step, isn't it?
I was also unsure what was meant by the picture alone but it is good to see it explained and I couldn't agree more. I regularly browse that sub and have reached out a few times when I could to try to impart any knowledge, experience and support.. a friendly shoulder to lean on to people.

It's when people reach rock bottom and then go possibly even past it, where absolutely nothing in the world makes them feel they want to go on... nothing but at the same time... I feel a lot of people just wish so much that there was..... that is I think what makes people reach out online... and I do think it is easier to be able to do it while sitting in your own room, behind the monitor and just being able to type out your feelings. Knowing that many of the people in that sub are either feeling (of have felt) the similar way or are there to try and help those who are.

It shouldn't be so taboo in society, there are people who really aren't shocked by it and do reach out in person, there are people who get so upset at the thought of losing you that they get almost "angry" because they couldn't bare it.. there are those who just are ignorant (those are the scary ones when it comes to trying to open up and talk to someone about it).

Professionals can only do so much - I think in the professional field Psychologists are possibly the best people to speak to but many are difficult to come by without an extremely hefty price tag.

I do continue to wish (and have since I was a young teenager) that people would feel they could reach out more easily... so many lives are lost who otherwise might have been able to go on and find the happiness they perhaps so desperately wanted... =(
>  It seems to me that the only reason that anonymous support is preferred over that of a friend or family member is because the latter isn't available. 

In my experience, that's generally not true at all.  It's not simple, though, because the factors that cause people to seek death by suicide in the first place are primarily *interpersonal*, which means that it's probably completely wrong-headed to see the goal as world where, when someone becomes suicidal, family and friends will be able to help.  If the family and friends were able to help, they'd have been able to prevent the person from becoming suicidal in the first place.  

>  raising more awareness is the first step, isn't it?

I think we need to be careful.  There are a lot of common misconceptions about suicide and suicidality among the general population, and some "awareness" that's been raised has actually done far more harm than good, for example the spillover of the "it gets better" tagline and movement to suicidality in general.  
It's interesting when you say:

"it's probably completely wrong-headed to see the goal as world where, when someone becomes suicidal, family and friends will be able to help. If the family and friends were able to help, they'd have been able to prevent the person from becoming suicidal in the first place."

Personally, I don't find this to be true in my situation. When I became suicidal, I found that having friends and family around me who care and understand was one of the most beneficial things that could have been done. Why do would you think that this would not be the case if such resources were available? You seem to understand the psychology of it better than me, but I'm wondering why my situation differed.

Most people *become* suicidal because they experience profound interpsonal alienation, and one of the key causes of that is often some kind of profound family dysfunction. That's why we advise caution about encouraging our OPs to talk to their families - the majority of the time the family is at least part of the problem.  It's not univerally true (there are few, if any, absolutes when dealing with human beings), as your experience indicates, but at a rough estimate I'd say that in less than 5% of the people I encounter here or at the hotline are family members able to provide enough help to get the suicidal person to a point of long-term stability.  If you want to learn more about all this, there are some references linked from the talking tips post in the SW sidebar.  
Thanks for the insights, i appreciate then immensely. The weird thing is that I do feel the alienation. When life goes bad circumstantially I feel alienated, then when I get depressed I feel alienated. When my depression snowballs and my relationships start suffering, then I feel the most alienated.

Do you think I'm just one of the luckier people with good supports? I'm trying to piece this together in my head. I mean, the way you make the typical person sound I feel like I should be doing way worse. Why have I been okay?

I'll be sure to take a look at those posts on the side bar. I didn't mean to ask you like you like half a dozen questions in 3 days... But thanks for putting up with it and providing good answers. It really does help me understand. I probably took up a lot of your time and I apologize for that.
> Do you think I'm just one of the luckier people with good supports? I'm trying to piece this together in my head. I mean, the way you make the typical person sound I feel like I should be doing way worse. Why have I been okay?

It's really hard to say without knowing a lot more about your situation, but if these questions are taking up space in your head, then educating yourself about suicidality (either of the books by Thomas Joiner that are linked from the tips post would be a great option) might be a worthwhile use of your time.

> I didn't mean to ask you like you like half a dozen questions in 3 days... But thanks for putting up with it and providing good answers. 

It's no problem.  Improving understanding one person at a time is why I'm here.  And you're welcome :-) 


Sad story. Good idea to be truthful IF it inspires others to live. Hard to know if the opposite won't happen. 
My boss's wife just lost a brother to suicide.  She shared it with a few of us at work and one guy(J) we work with could tell how hard it hit me because of my own struggles.  We talked about it in depth.  J decided to get help for his alcoholism because of this.  He's been in rehab since this happened a month ago.  

I was always very open about my struggles with depression, doubly so now.
Good idea.. Thanks

Oh my goodness these are beautiful and yeah, I don't even know what to say. The first one especially jumped out at me
Wow. These are great! Especially the 1st and the 4th one! I'd love to see more of your work! 
I love these!  you are a very talented artist.  keep creating!
Thank you so much for your kind words. It means the world to me.

As a psychologist, this made me laugh...and made me sad at the same time. Hopefully we can get to a place in North America where this attitude is uncommon, rather than the fodder for humour.

ive been a listener for about a year, its a extremely rewarding system of helping others, or even just listening to someone rant like crazy about a breakup.

only 2 times did i have the feeling i may have saved a life, but im the kind of person that says "hi!" and smiles when passing people, hoping if i stop 1 person from committing suicide my life was worth it.
I tried that out once. My "listener" felt like not listening at all, and sounded like a computer program in his answers. Was that just bad luck?
I've visited this site multiple times and each time I got nothing but rude people "listening" to me. 
One even went as far as to say if I was so upset, then I should kill myself already. 

I refuse to visit that site ever again. 
Cool! Has anyone tried it out? 
OH! theres an android app as well. nicely built and well programmed.
Yeah, usually it takes a few tries to get a listener who's right although all listeners have to pass a test first. 
Oh my goodness! I'm really sorry to hear that you were connected with such a terrible listener and were treated so poorly. I promise you there are plenty of good ones on there,  you can browse by rating to ensure you get the best possible experience. I'd really encourage you to report whoever said that to you on 7Cups,  as this person should be banned from the website. 

I hope you're feeling okay right now,  and that things have improved a bit for you? 
Yup, being a listener can be highly rewarding (even when interacting with trolls) I've only done about 5 conversations but they left a positive impact on me. Might've even helped pull me out of a small depression I was stuck in.
ya i would recommend it for text chat help, it can be a bit of wait between 3-10 minutes at times but they have chimes when you finally get in. been on it for a year and i like it so far. 
yes, ive been a listener around a year. and i used the service  a few times myself.
its a very open community, and very well done.
Things have improved immensely since then. 

At the time(which was a little over a year ago), I was homeless and couch hopping, dating a man who was abusive, and I was at my wits end and wanted nothing more than to end my life. I was stuck. 

Now, however, I have a wonderful boyfriend who goes above and beyond for me, we have a home together, we have 6 wonderful fur babies and life is peachy. 

Sure, I still have my moments where I feel things would be better off were I not here, but that comes with the clinical depression territory. 
I'm glad to hear that things have improved so much for you since then - it sounds like you have some truly wonderful things going on in your life now :)

It's understandable that you still have some tough moments too. Again, I'm sorry to hear about your bad experience with that listener on 7Cups, but if you ever want to have a chat or need some support, I'd be happy to talk. I can PM you my listener name if you ever need it. Take care  

Sites like this have the best intentions in the world, but they are usually not kept up to date very well.  The US information here is out of date (1-800-SUICIDE is being phased out in favour of 800-273-TALK), for example.  

Over in /r/SuicideWatch, [we actively maintain a list with assistance from our community](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines), and also highly recommend [the ISAP's directory of crisis centre's worldwide](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/).  
I am aware of this. Just thought I'd share as I 'personally' made the webpage today. And checked every number with two sources - to ensure they were correct. I will be taking great care with updates to the page. This is why I never made it an infographic/image like many on social media platforms. ISAP is a wonderful resource :)
There are hundreds if not thousands of sites of this nature, and I don't think individuals making them, no matter how committed they are to maintenance, is a  good idea.  

When lonely do you find a friend and talk about it or find support? 

I find it hard to reach out. I'm an outgoing person who's always known as the happy person, but when I'm down I'm down. 
I think that lonely is the hardest one to identify. So not many reach out for lonely. It requires being a bit more self aware than hungry. 
I do all the time, and it makes it worse when people still ignore my existence. 
I do.  To amazon, etsy, rei... 😫
I don't necessarily tell the person I'm lonely, but I try to reach out for someone to spend time with. That may be doing something with my boyfriend and asking for his attention. Or getting coffee with a friend. Or just being around people at a restaurant or in town. 

Depends what kind of lonely. Single lonely isnt something I'd ever admit to when I was but I'd be more motivated to go to the club or spark a conversation with random women. The other lonely, just needing to be with a friend...I wouldn't admit to it but I'd definitely reach out to friends to hang out. When feeling really low I might actually call them. Yuck
I'm lonely almost always, but who is there to reach out to? There's nothing more awkward for me than trying to talk to internet strangers as if they were therapists
I'm really never lonely so I can't say if I would. Probably not though.
Sometimes I feel lonely in the way where I need snuggles or just a person in the house. My boyfriend will come over and hang out so I'm not alone. Often he just sits in bed with me and plays on his phone. If he's out of town I'll call him. When my friends are in a dark place, I always offer to come over and just hang out. Generally they'll do the same. If I just want someone in the house, my brother will come over and play with my cats. When I was in school, if I felt lonely I'd go to the apartment below mine and hang out with my neighbor and his pug. I'd just tell him I was feeling bad emotionally and didn't want to be alone. He'd continue watching TV or playing video games while I played with the dog or talked about what happened. Then he'd tell me about what he was doing or we'd play Jeopardy. Other times I'll call my mom or dad to talk.

To be honest though, most of the time my cats keep me from feeling lonely. Like, I always feel needed and loved because my two fluffers need me to feed and care for them, and they prefer me to all other humans (especially my male cat, he cries by the door if I leave him with my family or I leave with a suitcase. He needs his mommy). I'll play with them or clean up so they have more space. I'll go get something from Whole Foods because my male cat only likes their paper bags like the spoiled bourgeois fatty he is. I'll sit on the balcony with them. Or I'll listen to the Mental Illness Happy Hour podcast and I'll hear all the surveys from people just like me and feel less alone.

I guess I try to make sure no one around me feels alone and as a result, I'm very rarely lonely.

What is wrong with my wife?

We’ve been together 6 years. None of what I’m about to detail was present or obvious in the first two years. By the third year I’d realized she’d developed a drinking problem, which has exacerbated the matters  I’m about to lay out but which can’t be the source, I’m sure.  For context, we are both in our mid thirties.

I am having so much difficulty writing this post, I want to put it in chronological order but I just can’t remember the exact dates for every episode and there have been so many. I’ll start with the worst episode she’s had and then work around from there.

We moved into a new house 1.5 years ago. She was well into her drinking problem stage at this point and it was a constant source of contention with us. I had spent two years trying to cut her drinking down and had gotten to the point where she would grudgingly agree to 1 or 2 days of the week not drinking, which was a victory.
  The day we moved into this new house she stopped drinking completely for six days straight which was unheard of at this point. She would never stop drinking of her own accord, I always had to force the issue. This time, she did it of her own volition.

She spent those six days sitting in our new lounge room just gazing out the window at cars going by and was very unresponsive to me during this time.

Whenever I’d try talk to her she’d gently fob me off with as few words as possible and eventually I’d just stick my head in the lounge every few hours to...just see what she was doing, and she was always doing the same thing, just sitting there staring out the window. Literally 8 hours a day she would be doing this. She asked me several times over this period if I could hear the orchestra/choral music coming out of the air vents, I thought she was nuts but played along and listened to the vents and conceded that I could hear the traffic and airflow and maybe that’s what she was hearing? She insisted that I just couldn’t hear properly though and that there was a choral singing coming through the air vents and even sang it for me.

A friend from overseas came to stay with us a day later over New Years and that night the three of us were drinking.
 She wanted to drink again suddenly and seemed back to her old self again and was in her usual normal high spirits, friendly and gregarious. I left at one point and came back to hear her detailing something absolutely bizarre to him. 
She was telling him in all earnestness that she’d been hearing the voice of a man called Bryan who had told her that she was going to be his queen but only after she went through the rainbow gate/bridge .  Upon further questioning, she admitted that she’d have to commit suicide to be with him but that she was adamantly opposed to that idea and thought it was stupid. 
She was still discussing all this as if it were perfectly reasonable. I stayed hidden around the corner from her listening, however our friend could see me and I encouraged him via hand and eye signals to keep her talking so I could get more information. It went on in the same vein for the next hour, promises from some entity called Bryan who didn’t like me at all and was the reason we hadn’t had sex in the past week (he told her not to trust me and not to sleep with me)

Our friend left the next day to stay with other friends, telling me he was deeply uncomfortable with what had passed.  Shortly after this, she seemed to snap out of it all, she began interacting with me like normal again, she began drinking again, regrettably, and she admitted that she had heard voices and angels singing but that “that was in the past, I was just being silly, god I’m so embarrassed”. 

That’s all I can remember properly of that time – on to the current day-  Many times I find her having some kind of manic episode, where her  eyes will be glazed and staring just slightly out of phase with where they should  be,  and she will be laughing maniacally at the smallest things and it won’t be her normal laugh, it’s either some kind of horrific forced sounding caricature of a laugh or an angry grunting one. Engaging her during one of these episodes results in a momentary embarrassed snap back to normality before resuming.

I found her on the floor again recently, yelling and arguing with the air. There was a lot of swearing and growling and snarling –it sounded like Klingon for gods sake, I imagine this is what people refer to when they talk about people speaking in tongues.
 This has happened many times, and whenever (after watching silently for however long) I make my presence known, she immediately snaps into a semblance of her normal self and seems to be embarrassed, apologizing yet never really addressing what she’d just been doing.
 She will make it clear that she knows she’s been doing something wrong but it is utterly impossible to get her to pin it down, you can’t communicate properly with her in these moments, the conversations become cyclical and repetitive and go nowhere. 
Important to mention here too that even after she’s snapped back to normality and apologised in her normal voice, once I leave the room she will return almost immediately to growling and snarling and cursing loudly at god knows what. (If I then go back into the room, she will return to normality briefly before slowly degenerating into a cyclical nonsensical conversation)

I should point out here that at this point I’ve been in control of her finances utterly for years now due to her drinking. I have become acutely aware of her changes in mood and disposition and can tell within seconds if she has had anything to drink. 
I realise that might seem a bold claim but I have lived with her for nearly 6 years now and am absolutely familiar with all her behaviour, her drinking is an open book for me now. I control our money,  I know where our last fifty cent coin is. 
I mention this because I want to stress that her behaviour can’t simply be ascribed to the booze or lack of it. On days when she has had nothing to drink, she has been wonderful and gentle and enthusiastic about life, but upon dozing off briefly beside me on the couch or in bed (we’re talking 5 minutes) she will awaken and her eyes will be out of phase and...it’s hard to describe. 
They’re focussing but barely and they seem glazed. Her voice goes higher when this happens too and she apparently forgets where she is and what she’s doing. Her voice remains high and slightly breathy during these instances (she has a husky voice for a female so it’s especially noticeable – her normal relaxed voice is vastly different from the sound of her voice during one of these fugue states, as I refer to them) She will repeat phrases like “it’s all wrong” over and over and over and when pressed for clarification is unable to give any answer beyond “IT is wrong. Just IT.”  
Absolutely unable or unwilling to answer questions in a straight manner – like I said earlier, questioning her only ends up with a cyclical conversation, IE – 
IT’S WRONG
What’s wrong?
ALL OF IT. 
What it?
YOU KNOW. ALL OF IT
I don’t know, can you tell me?
TELL YOU WHAT?
What’s wrong?
ALL OF IT
Right, but what ‘it’ are you talking about?
IT. YOU KNOW.
I don’t know, what it?
UGH IT. IT IS ALL WRONG	
That will go on a dozen different ways but always end up the same. There is absolutely no pinning her down to a proper answer .

She keeps going into these fugue states where she insists something is wrong and that people are coming to kill me, that I have to run and hide. The first time she pulled that one out, I was half asleep and I can’t describe the shiver that came over my soul, I came awake quickly thinking my life was in danger before realizing she was just talking random mess again. That particular idea of hers came to a head tonight when I was driving back from the gym and received a call from her panicking that men had just come to the front door and walked inside demanding to know where the drugs were.
 I was in the car turning at the corner less than 20m away at this point so I pulled up outside our house within seconds and she came running out to meet me and pointed to the man who had been at the door. I got out, leaving the car running on the road which is a testament to how shaken I was,  and asked him if I could help him, he was a young asian with his mother and aunt? I’m not sure who the ladies were but I turned to my wife and asked her if she was sure this was the right person upon which she started mumbling that it probably wasn’t the same person. I was mortified and apologised to the three strangers and guided my wife back inside the house where she spent the next two hours in the bedroom yelling and cursing at thin air. 

She has just emerged now and politely and gently thanked me for the dinner I made earlier. She’s normal again now. 
Anyway, everything I’ve just detailed is getting worse and more frequent. 
These incidents used to be something that happened every few months which was rare enough to shrug off, then it suddenly became fortnightly and now it’s every second day. 
Every second night I lie in bed next to her listening to her swear at nonexistent people and occasionally punching the headboard. I beg her to be quiet so I can sleep and she responds with nonsense. In the morning though she is back to her original beautiful self and I start doubting myself. 


I’ve typed so much here. I realise it’s a mess, I have a few more items that are salient.  Before we lived alone together we lived with a mutual friend, around 3 years ago. He came home one night while I was at work to find her swaying in the front window with her face covered in blood. 
 He pressed on inside not knowing what was waiting for him, bless him, and found she’d fallen over and he took her to the ER even though she insisted nothing was wrong and was smiling and wandering around the house like everything was normal, covered in blood. 
Before they left in a taxi to the ER our friend said he’d seen a large pool of blood in the back yard where presumably she’d fallen and hit her head and then lain for god knows how long. (Pool of blood was gone when we all got home, I’m assuming our dog lapped it up)

I took her home from the ER that night and we both shared a cigarette while we waited for a taxi, she passed out again shortly afterward and hit her head on the ground when she fell in front of our front door. Ever since then, she often becomes massively dizzy and falls asleep/passes out within minutes of smoking a cigarette, which never happened prior. 
I fear I was negligent in not taking her back to the ER after she hit her head that second time on the way home and wonder all the time if my reluctance to make a second trip to the hospital has resulted in exacerbated damage to her, was it a concussion? Should I have taken her back again? 
She has visited our family doctor 2 dozen times since then and he’s certified her fit for duty but I’m also fairly certain she is glossing over details and not giving him the full story. I have told her that I will go to him (family doctor) together with her to discuss this so we can get it all straight but she insists I’m not allowed to come, that visiting him is her safe place and she doesn’t want to disappoint him. (her words)

I’ve also tried to have her committed once but the police present at the time said they couldn’t do that unless she’d threatened her own life.

Anyway fuck someone help me please, point me in a direction, I need to do something because this is just getting worse and worse. I’ve spent hours writing this up and it’s late for me, I have to work early AM so I’m just going to post now and hope for something useful I can find tomorrow.
 

Have you discussed seeing a psychiatrist with her? Is that an option? Given her extreme episodes, I would think something would be evident upon examination.

Also, you might want to seek some counseling as well to help support you through this. It's clearly taking a heavy toll on you, and you deserve some peace of mind as well.
This must be terrifying for you to go through.  I am so sorry it's happening to you, but moreover sorry that it is happening to her.  She must be scared all the time, with no way to distinguish reality from illusion.

I am not a doctor, but this sounds like schizophrenia, definition at the bottom.  The drinking isn't a surprise either, as many people with this disorder are dual diagnosis, which is drug/alcohol dependence in addition to mentail illness.  Not surprising people so afflicted want to escape from themselves.

Get her to a psychologist or mental health professional.  She needs help.  Good luck to you and her. 

> a long-term mental disorder of a type involving a breakdown in the relation between thought, emotion, and behavior, leading to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of mental fragmentation.
This breaks my heart. I am sorry for both you and her. You are going to have to get her to been seen by a professional.
[deleted]
Wow.  What a living nightmare you've been stuck in.  I'm not a clinician but I am frontline triage for a mental-health crisis line.  Based on my experience, the best next step I can see based on your wife's unwillingness to seek professional help, is for you to lay this all out for a professional who's familiar with your local resources and who can give you expert guidance to move things forward.

Most places these days have mental health crisis teams who are glad to speak with concerned third parties.  If you need help finding one, send us a modmail over at /r/SuicideWatch and refereence this comment.
Wow this is a lot for you to go through. I'm glad that you are concerned for her safety and health. One thing is for sure, she needs to see a therapist/doctor.  The hallucinations/delusions could become very dangerous for her and possibly others. Does she have any family that you could ask for help? 
She definitely needs to get diagnosed by a psych. Sounds like the progression of a serious mental illness. Best of luck to both of you, hope you are able to work through it.
It sounds to me like schizophrenia. My uncle is an alcoholic who goes through manic episodes not too dissimilar to your wife. He'll have days where he won't drink and you think he's through the worst;that maybe I was making his illness worse in my head,then before you know it he's talking to himself and avoiding the world again. Psychiatry is your best hope. Try to find a doctor together who she feels comfortable opening up to. I'm really sorry for your predicament but you sound like an angel with untold patience so please don't give up on her. All the best.
Possibly schizoaffective. The mix of emotional and delusional symptoms, along with the catatonic state when you moved (big change is not good for those with mental illness). But it doesn't matter what it is. She needs professional help. Asap. Nothing will get better until she gets meds and therapy. 
This could be a few things... From schizophrenia to a brain tumor. She needs to see someone. Start with her primary doctor. Seriously, if she won't go, call them and tell them what is going on and see what they advise you to do 
Among other things, your wife is having auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoia. She NEEDS to be evaluated by a mental health professional as soon as possible. If your family doctor is not treating this with the seriousness necessary (as it seems he is not), seek help from your local mental health center. If she is a danger to herself or others (as it sounds like she is), she can be involuntarily committed by a doctor or the police (laws/rules vary by state). 

The base cause of this could be a multitude of things, but it's pointless to speculate on them until she gets evaluated thoroughly by a mental health professional (preferably a psychiatrist i.e., someone with an MD). If she will not seek treatment herself or does not tell them the extent of the problems (e.g., Bryan, voices, being told to harm herself or others by imaginary people), then you need to. The drinking was likely her attempt to self medicate to dampen the voices etc., but is likely not the underlying cause of the problem. 

She has been clear that the "voices" are telling her to hurt herself or others. She needs help from mental health professionals IMMEDIATELY before she acts on those impulses. 

> I’ve also tried to have her committed once but the police present at the time said they couldn’t do that unless she’d threatened her own life.

The police often aren't the best at handling people with mental illness. If a doctor heard, "This person Bryan that only I can see and who lives in my ceiling vent told me that if I killed myself I could live forever as his queen. And by the way, he hates my husband and has suggested that I murder him in his sleep," they would very likely involuntarily commit her. If she will not be honest with the doctors about what she is hearing/seeing, you need to tell them. And personally, if someone I loved were exhibiting such serious symptoms of mental illness and they did not quite meet the requirements for involuntary commitment, I would just lie and say that I had heard them clearly threaten their own life. Keep in mind that all those times she'd been found with mysterious injuries may have been her attempts at self harm. To help your case, ask all of the people that have witnessed her bizarre behavior to write a short statement/email/etc. about what they have seen. That way, even if she denies it, there will be more than your word to back up your side of the story. The mental health system will always back the police or a doctor when they ask for an initial involuntary commitment. She needs help before she harms herself and/or you. 
Hey there! I really recommend you get her to see a psychiatrist and have therapy sessions. Also try to get her to stop drink for just 1 whole week and see how she is and then get her drinking for 1 whole week and see how she is. Get her to have some brain scans and ask her about anything major that's happened in the past that could've caused this.
On top of everything else that has been said, a few random suggestions:

- Remove or lock away any and all obvious weapons and poisons from the house (e.g., firearms, rat poison, pesticides). 
- Remove, lock away, or keep track of all medications in the house. Especially anything that could be used for self-harm (e.g., pain pills or prescription meds). Note that Tylenol overdose can be very deadly, and the resultant liver failure is a very unpleasant way to go. At least consider reducing the amounts available, if you have large stocks of meds. 
- Consider keeping track of her internet usage history in case you see her researching ways to harm herself or others. It may also give you another window into her mental state. 
- Keep a journal of events. This will help your recall and allow you to track the frequency and type of episodes. You may also be able to identify triggers to the various behaviors. Also, this makes your case stronger with the police and/or doctors. 
- I assume she is not working, but that you are. So she is likely alone for much of the day. Is it possible to have someone check on her during the day? This also gives you another witness to her behavior if you need someone to back your claims. 
- Does she interact with anyone besides you on a frequent basis? It doesn't sound like it. 
- If you believe the alcohol problem is alcoholism, then try to get her seen as a "dual diagnosis" patient (i.e., substance abuse + mental illness). There are often special programs and in-patient treatment facilities for dual diagnosis where they can detox/withdraw and get mental health help at the same time. 

I'm sure you know, but to put it bluntly, your wife has a very serious mental illness that has gone undiagnosed and untreated for years. The illness is clearly increasing in severity rapidly. She appears to be experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations on a daily basis (potentially nearly constantly). If she does not get significant help soon, the likelihood of her harming herself or someone else seems quite high. 
A suggestion my partner had was to set up CCTV cameras in every room she frequently goes in and show the footage to a doctor or authority of some sort. They may make it so she has to attend a psychiatrist by court order or something.

Also maybe show her the footage and see if she remembers it or not. If she doesn't it may push her to be honest with her doctor and get this sorted out. 
I would say this is psychosis, I suffer from it myself and it is brutal. Get her to a doctor asap just to be sure though.
These are some possibilities, but I highly recommend seeing a professional. 

Alcohol is essentially a drug because one can develop a dependence on it. All drugs which eventually lead to a dependence affect the dopamine system. This is evident in hard drugs such as cocaine, meth and heroin. One's brain releases an unnatural amount of endorphin's and neurotransmitters when using one of the drugs, that the only way they can essentially get the same feeling is when they consume something more powerful. The same can even be said about internet pornography. A user can become addicted, and eventually, the porn they watch starts to have less and less of an effect on them, that the user eventually demands more hardcore pornography. This is why hardcore alcoholics stereo-typically seek hard liquor instead of wine. 

The dopamine actually comes with the craving of these things. The endorphin's, or neurotransmitters, are responsible for the pleasure that is actually received from the high or state of drunkenness, or numbness. 

Your wife's brain may have been essentially rewired to such an extent that her dopamine pathways require these feelings of numbness or drunkenness to feel good, or even normal. Essentially, she may have damaged her dopamine receptors, which can naturally rebuild on their own through time and nutrition. This means that she is going through withdrawal symptoms until her dopamine receptors recover fully, which may take months to years depending on how bad her alcoholism is/was. 

This article should help immensely:

It sounds like severe withdrawal symptoms from when she stopped for a week..
Thankyou. I have suggested that, and she was going to therapy for a while but ceased it. I don't think she was being completely forthcoming with him at all. I can get her to agree to see a psychiatrist with me but when time comes to go, she backs out. It's frustrating. Thanks again for your words.
I forgot to mention that! I did manage to successfully insist on her having an MRI. They found nothing unusual, which was a kick in the teeth at the time, I'd been hoping so hard that...I dunno, they'd find some wee issue and fix it and our lives could get back to normal.
I've always described it to myself as a living nightmare. Oddly, having someone else put it in the same words makes me feel better slightly, thank you.
It took me a while but I did go to her parents about this. Her mother is an angel and has gone above and beyond trying to help but at this point I've started minimizing telling them what's really going on. Her mother had to watch her raving daughter get taken away in an ambulance she called for her and she was beside herself. I feel like letting them know everything that's going on is only going to cause them utter grief they don't need. I am guilty of whitewashing the truth when her mother asks about it now.
Thank you. I don't want to accept that praise of a patient angel though. I have sometimes said hideous and hurtful things to her  when she's in her fugue state, because I know she won't remember it the next day, out of pure frustration and fury at her refusal to stop drinking. I often have to force myself to remember that she is ill and this is not her fault, she's not doing it deliberately, otherwise my initial emotion is a kind of sick disappointment and anger that she's having another episode.
I have to clarify here that _she_ didn't threaten my life, she said unnamed others were after me. If I thought she was going to hurt me things might be different now, but her unswerving love and loyalty to me even during these episodes is constant and even makes things harder for me, because how could I possibly think about leaving someone so devoted to me?

You said "I would just lie and say that I had heard them clearly threaten their own life." and ABSOLUTELY I am on board with that, I wouldn't have hesitated doing it, zero qualms. My only problem is that her lucidity returns and she puts on a false face for people talking to her. There have been several hospital visits and a couple of police involvements and every time it's been put down to alcohol, as she doesn't display the other insane symptoms I've mentioned in front of these people. Also, the switch from incoherent to lucid is so fast that I don't even really have the option of waiting for her to go crazy and then quickly calling an ambulance, as I've no guarantee she will be in the same state when they arrive and I'm not going to continually tie  up the ambulance service on the off chance the timing is right. Sorry, that all sounded a bit confrontational and it's not the way I intended it.



Replying to this for any partners or friends of alcoholics that may be reading. Getting her to stop for one day is an effort. Two days is a happy miracle. Anything beyond that is...beyond me. I haven't been able to do it yet. You don't just stop an alcoholic drinking for a week, y'know.
No, she doesn't really interact with anyone else, it's a big problem. We met when she moved interstate and left all her friends of the past decade behind in the old state, she hasn't really made any new ones as she doesn't work, as you correctly surmised. I'm a loner mostly so I haven't had any large enough social circles to introduce her into.  
Cheers for the tip on dual diagnosis.

I had the idea to keep a diary of her nightly behaviour a year ago, I didn't follow through and I regret it immensely, god knows there has been enough to fill it.

When I got home from work today I read the replies to this thread shortly before she came to talk to me about something else, which indirectly led to me bringing up things I'd mentioned in my OP and things people had replied with. (all without actually mentioning me making this post, although I am considering showing the thread to her). She agreed for the both of us to see a psychiatrist together, which she has done before but I am telling myself it sounds genuine this time. She's well out of her gourd at the moment but I am hoping she remembers the feeling she had when she committed to seeing the shrink, as she was sober at the time and meant it, I know. 


Recording her behavior is a good idea. Something to show other people and something to confront her with if she denies there is a problem. 

But keep in mind that the laws around involuntary commitment are quite strict. Usually, you need a police officer or doctor to ask for the order. And even then, it usually requires the person to clearly threaten harm to herself or someone else. Just acting crazy or hearing voices is not enough. 
(cheapfaggot411)
Your still alive?!
I figured.
That's what the mental healthline I called at the time said, BUT I have to disagree, because I have seen her not drink for a day or two and suffer no ill effects. These hallucinations started the very next morning which I assume is too soon for withdrawal to be having any serious affect otherwise surely I would have noticed it happen every morning when she woke up? 
Talk therapy is not going to solve this. Very likely there is a physiological cause, and she will need a battery of mental heath tests, brain scans, and blood tests, as well as medication or other medical treatment. She needs to see a psychiatrist (i.e., a person with an MD) who can seek out and treat the cause of the problems. You don't have auditory and visual hallucinations that instruct you to kill yourself because your mom didn't come to your dance recital when you were 10. 
You know your life is in a bad way when the *best* outcome is that your wife has a brain tumor. As u/hungrydyke said, don't forget to look after yourself. It can be hard to try to help a loved one while simultaneously trying to keep both your lives afloat. 
Glad to hear it.  In these types of situations I think it's important to be clear with ourselves about what is and isn't within our control.  Unfortunately, your wife's choices, no matter how self-destructive and irrational, are outside your control.

As for you, I fear you have some tough choices of your own ahead of you.  Please get the best support and guidance you can with them.

I would come clean with them for a number of reasons:

- She is their daughter, and they should be fully aware of her mental health state. 
- You want them to back you on any kind of play you make, not oppose you (e.g., on an involuntary commitment). You consistently telling them what is going on will help that. 
- They may be able to help with resources you don't have access to (e.g., friends who are doctors, money, etc.). 
- Telling someone else about everything that is going on may be cathartic for you and help you shoulder the burden. 
- They may be able to tell the doctors about any past episodes or mental health problems in the rest of the family tree. Some mental conditions have a strong genetic component. 

Does she have siblings or other close relatives you would feel comfortable confiding in? Other close friends?
It's only human to get frustrated and angry,especially at things we can't understand so it doesn't make you a bad person. I'm sure she's said equally nasty stuff to you that she regrets during her better days. Try to give yourself a break,you're doing the best you can.
Can you record some of her episodes? Even audio would go a long way to prove your case, if video is too hard to manage. If she is good at hiding her condition (which she may have been doing for years), then you need as much hard evidence as possible or other witnesses to back you up.

The question/problem is, how different is "Bryan" telling her to harm you (or herself) from part of her thinking it herself? I am in no way suggesting leaving her, but that you be realistic about what she might do while in one of her states or what she might do to stop/fight the voices. She may be in a near constant battle with the voices, trying to do what she knows is right, versus what the misfiring parts of her brain are telling her.

Just read your last reply. Good luck OP. 


Oh ok, well I didn't know because I don't drink but at least try to stop her for the maximum amount you can and see if she still has these episodes
Perhaps hosting an intervention in her "home" state where her parents and friends are concentrated may be a good idea. This would likely mean she'd seek treatment there instead of near your home, but it may be easier to have as many of her closest friends and family there. An experienced mental health professional may have good advice about this. But everyone involved needs to be fully informed as to the nature and severity of her problems. Again, her parents might not be on board with an involuntary commitment of their daughter if you have not been clear with them about how bad the situation has gotten. 

Research the laws on involuntary commitment in your state and in her "home" state. Also look at what treatment facilities are available in each region. Again, a dual diagnosis in-patient treatment program may be a good option. Keep in mind that these programs are (unfortunately) in high demand, and they may not have a bed immediately available. Pre-planning is important here. 
Yeah because I said "i want to" not "I'm going to" moron 😂
Yes, this is not from alcohol withdrawal. The alcohol was most likely her way to self-medicate and stop the hallucinations. 
I agree absolutely and I phrased it in terms like that when I spoke to her just now, adding that if there is indeed something wrong physiologically with her then we can start looking for a solution, and wouldn't it be wonderful to actually be free of this? 
Talk therapy was the best I could get her to agree to at the time. As of this evening she has agreed again to see a psychiatrist after I described to her what happened yesterday, all of which she had forgotten. 
Jesus what a way to put it. Hah, you're right though.
I'm confident her parents will back me on any move I make, so no problem there. One of her best friends lives interstate, I have talked occasionally with her about my wife's issues, but she can't really render any help and even though she's offered her ear any time and I would appreciate being able to unload on someone else, it seems pointless.

While I was typing this she has been yelling in the next room, there was just a huge smash and I went in to discover the 50 inch TV her parents gifted us has been destroyed. She said she didn't know how it happened. She's in the bathroom now, I have to go clean the glass up, thanks for your several replies, I will read and reply again later.


Also you definitely need to have brain scans and psychological treatment because this is very serious and unfortunately your wife is very mentally ill.
Also, try to get her to sign a HIPAA waiver with the doctor/hospital so that you can see and discuss all of her health issues with the doctor. That will allow you to see all of her test results, discuss her case fully with the doctors, etc. This is very important if she has a tendency to be deceptive about what did or did not happen at the appointments and/or will not allow you to go with her. The doctor/hospital should have a standard form, and only she needs to sign it (you do not). Probably a good idea to get one for her primary care doctor as well. 

If she does not even remember her episodes, then obviously something very serious is going on. 
> I'm confident her parents will back me on any move I make, so no problem there. 

You need to be very sure in this regard. People can sometimes react in unexpected ways in these situations. Especially if you have been hiding the severity of the problem from them, they may not be as on board with your plans as you think. 

> One of her best friends lives interstate, I have talked occasionally with her about my wife's issues, but she can't really render any help and even though she's offered her ear any time and I would appreciate being able to unload on someone else, it seems pointless.

The time may come soon where you need to organize an intervention involving her parents, other close relatives, and friends. You need to be clear to people that she is close to about the severity and nature of her addiction and mental illness problems. Additionally, you will need to be able to confront her about the issues in a way that she cannot deny them. Again, recording her during her episodes may be very useful here. 

That is an excellent idea, thank you.
I'm leaving you. I'm sorry, but there's someone else.

Look, I know we were high school sweethearts. We met when I was 15, and the word cancer was placed on the table before me by a doctor who turned out to be wrong. You held my hand through a surgery no 15 year old girl should have to have. You cried with me when the scar didn't fade and I thought no man would crave me because I was "damaged".

You held the blade I used to pierce my skin at 16 when the monster I thought loved me cheated on me and then raped me behind the portables at school. When the word began to spread that I self harmed, you told me the wounds were beautiful. That I needed more.

You disappeared at 17 when my eyes met his for the first time, and as we discovered each other's minds and bodies and fell in love...I almost forgot you existed. I was no longer bound to you. The ring on my hand meant I was his.

But at 19, when he lost his battle with you and took his life, you almost gained two trophies for your cabinet. My body shut down, my mind was weak. I turned to anything dangerous I could get my hands on, to be with the one thing I loved. The thing you took from me.

It's been two years, depression. Two years of drowning in your raging tides and devastating winds. Two years of trying to move on and love again, but failing because of my mistress..you.

But I've found a new escape. A happy place. A way to feel and forget at the same time. I've decided I'm ready to live again., I'm ready to feel alive again.

So, dear depression, our story must come to a close. I know you'll be around. You will linger in every lonely night and beckon for me to run back in to your dark, twisted arms. But I wont. I've found other arms to hold me. They will keep me safe.

You wont win.

Regards.
the woman you couldn't break.
lovely.
Beautiful! 
I'm better off because i read this. Thanks for the post. It's beautiful and inspiring.
Absolutely beautiful. Well done.

I really hate how romanticized self harm/depression has become.

But with that being said, your writing is beautiful and I loved reading it. 
This is amazing. You're amazing. Well done for writing this 
A wonderful poem. I love your outlook and perseverance. Keep writing and healing :)
This is much better than the anti-depressant commercial (ability) that shows depression as a tiny little demon that you can live with like a shadow
Is this a fairytale? People don't usually romanticise their mental illnesses. Sounds like a crappy love story if you ask me. 
Really? Thank you. <3
Thank you so much. 
Thank you for the kind words. Don't ever give up. 
Thank you, that means so much!
Thank you, I really am trying to. :)
I think if anything is being romanticized it's the act of moving on, growing as a person and learning to live with struggles. 
Thank you so much. I'm sorry if it seemed like I was romanticizing it. :/
In my mind, depression is just a darker version of me. She wears dark clothes. Writes dark writings.
She's not a little demon. She's the me I'd be if I gave up. But I never ever have. Not yet. 
Everyone copes with their illnesses differently, thank you for your input. 
YOU'RE AWESOME!
Thank you for understanding. It's hard to explain...depression became my companion when my partner died. I loved it because it was safe, and it was easier than processing my emotions and trying to move on.I don't know, I've always been weird.
You did it in a real way though. 
I loved reading it.

It's just too often (and not helped by social media) I run into people who have never had to deal with depression and think it's this beautiful, dark thing. Uh, no. It's a pit of apathy. 
That's great
You're welcome, it's nice to know my input is valued in this sympathy economy ☺️
I hate depression. It took my love from me, and it took myself from me. 
I hate it. But I have to say, it was there when nobody else was. It was safe, because I knew it wouldn't go away without a lot of pain and effort on my part, and I was too exhausted to try. 
People don't know until they *know*, and then nothing else exists. 
I'm 27 and been dealing with depression on and off for years. I'm thinking about going through deep brain stimulation.
Hey, I'm sorry about your struggles and feel you on the powerless and discouraged part. Nonetheless, would talking about your depression do just exactly the opposite -- it empowers you and helps you see that you're not alone after all? I know it's hard because I'm in therapy myself and it took a lot of power and courage in me to finally open up and do the real talk. It works, though, and now I'm getting much better.

Have you tried some talk therapy and medications? I think you should consider doing these before going directly to the deep brain stimulation because your issues could very well be due to underlying unresolved issues than solely physiological.
I'm sorry to hear this. Hugs.

My understanding of DBS is that it's kind of new, not poorly understood (both in how or why it works). I've just read some papers connected to it and it seems like it's a good avenue to go down. 

Best thing is to go and talk to your GP, see what they say.
Yeah, DBS might work. But the results we have seen with it thus far are pretty temporary. After all, (like anti-depressant medications) it does *not* reach and change the [cognitive distortions](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cognitive+distortions) back of most (not all) forms of chronic depression. 

Having been there, I can suggest the following (because they all worked for me): 

1) If you're taking drugs of any kind (including alcohol), take yourself to a detox and get off of them with expert help. (*This* kind of depression is usually chronic, cyclical, feedback-looping over-stimulation and [withdrawal](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=drug+withdrawal+psychology).) Or at least get into some [AA](http://www.aa.org/), [MA](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/) and/or [NA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=narcotics+anonymous).

2) If you came from an invalidating, frustrating, demoralizing, humiliating, [crazy-making family](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dysfunctional+family), get yourself to an [ACA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=adult+children+of+alcoholics+) meeting and read everything on their website before making any further decisions. (You'll find you are not only not alone, but that thousands of other people have found their way out of the "soup" in ACA.)

3) If you [stressed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=autonomic+stress+response) your way into depression, understand that your [autonomic nervous system](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=autonomic+nervous+system) is probably tilted out of balance, and that rest, relaxation, vitamins (D is *really* important), healthy food and appropriate medications and supplements (not always including anti-depressants, btw) offer good possibilities. Read [this article](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/treat-autonomic-and-cognitive.html) to get some further grounding?

4) Be careful with anti-depressant medications. If one is depressed as the result of having been [in-struct-ed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=social%20constructionism), [programmed]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mind+programming), [conditioned](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=operant+classical+conditioning), [socialized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=socialization+psychology) and/or [normalized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=normalization+social+psychology) to beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how one should / must / ought / has to be but cannot live up to, anti-Ds are not going to accomplish much other than get you dependent upon -- and functionally addicted *to* -- them. 

5) Get checked for thyroid and other hormonal disorders. 

6) If you have [thought](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cognitive+distortions) your way into depression with shame, guilt, worry, remorse, regret and morbid reflection, dig into the better cognitive psychotherapies like [REBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=rebt+therapy), [CBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cbt+therapy), [critical thinking](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=critical+thinking) and [schema therapy](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), all of which have much better than even potential of getting your mind out of the mental mush and into reality. A lot of these can be done to some extent in inexpensive workbooks one can find online. The publishers are usually New Harbinger or Guildford Press.

I currently use Ogden's [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) as the 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing), but had good results over the years with all of the psychotherapies I listed above.

Of course. You can only say the same things so many times with no results before it starts to make you feel hopeless.

It's hard because everyone says to get help. And they're right. But if you're still depressed after therapy and medication, people tend to be at a loss. Understandable, but fuck. It's a terrible feeling. Especially if they start to imply that you're not getting better because you're being lazy in treatment or something.

I've never tried DBS so I don't want to say whether or not you should do it, but it's worth looking into if you've been doing the therapy/medication thing for a while and still feel like shit. I had ECT last year and it helped a lot.
I don't know anything about it, but I want to wish you the best in your efforts to make yourself feel good again. stay strong my friend
I've gone to therapy for years and have tried numerous medications since then. It does nothing for me. It has only gotten worse and worse since I've gotten older. I have issues but this mental illness runs in my family. 
What a nice post. I love reading some generous post by someone trying to help another. it warms my heart.

For the op, here is a paper written on how to increase serotonin in your brain in a natural way. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/

It is interesting. 
Thanks for the reply. Now with other things tried and not seeing a result, I think it might be worthwhile to give the deep brain simulation a shot. Please though, have a consultation from at least two professionals to see if it's right for you before you go for it. Best of luck. 
I decided to post on here because I can't find much info on Munchhausen's online and I'm at my wits end and I really need to put a stop to this. I am 25 years old. Female. I believe I've had Munchhausen's syndrome since early adolescence and I have never told anyone about it. It's humiliating and I hate myself for it, but I can't stop myself. It is like a compulsion. I was diagnosed at 4 years old with stage 4 cancer. Considered terminal for some time. I was in active treatment from 4 to 6 years old. I think having a life-threatening illness at such a formative age really messed me up mentally. I love the role of "patient". It is comforting and familiar to me. Through my entire childhood I was in and out of hospitals and I enjoyed it. The reasons for me being sick were legitimate. I still have late-effects from my cancer treatment, however I am pretty healthy. Since my teen years I've been exaggerating or completely making up symptoms to get attention from my family and from doctors. I now work in health care and it's only gotten worse. I have taken medications to induce symptoms that otherwise I wouldn't have. I have tampered with tests. If you look up Munchhausen syndrome signs online, I have them all. I don't think anyone knows that I have this problem. I am an expert liar and manipulator. I am able to go long periods of time without acting on my "compulsions" and staying out of hospitals, but during these times I'm severely depressed. But sometimes I can't help it. I know it's wrong. I feel intense guilt. I am disgusted with my actions. I have previously attempted suicide because of it. How do I stop my behavior? I don't even know my first step. Can this be treated? Please help - I hate being like this. 
Are you seeing a therapist?  That seems like it would be the best next step.  Good job coming out to us!  That takes courage!  :)
I think i am reading a brave and wise person looking too negatively on herself. The first step is to seek help with a therapist. There is no shame and you don't need to tell every aspect of your thoughts. You need and deserve compassion regardless of any guilt you are feeling.

Oh and my advice is to not look for diagnostics criteria on line, it can't be fully accurate and can deepen your sadness
> Can this be treated?

Actually, yes. I think it was Silvan Tomkins who made the first major breakthroughs on treatment of the factitious disorders about 40 years ago. His student, Gershen Kaufman -- who got way down into treatments for shame -- may also have gotten into it, as well. MS can be a complex [defense mechanism](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=defense+mechanisms) to cope with intolerable anxiety, especially for people who were in some way traumatized as children (including having been chronically ignored, abandoned, invalidated, discounted, insulted, rejected, disclaimed, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, bullied, [scapegoated](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=scapegoating+in+families), and/or otherwise abused by others upon whom they depended for survival in early life). 

The key is to use a clinician locator like [this](https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/), or [this]( http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry), or [this](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) to find licensed experts who specialize in the tx of MS in particular or at least shame in general. (At least on one of those, you can dig around to see who does what.) Likewise you can dig around [here](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=munchausen+syndrome+treatment) and [here](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=factitious+disorder+treatment) to see how treatment is done, and who offers it.

I did not have MS or an FD myself, but did grow up conditioned to shame and was able to use a compilation of techniques I acquired from all of the following to deal with some pretty tx-resistant stuff over the last 15 years: I currently use Ogden's [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) as the [interoceptive](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=interoception+meditation) 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to manage any "time bombs" that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [schema therapy](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), and [CPT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy), as well as [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [HBCP](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html).

DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the abusive conditioning, programming, etc.
 
>I am disgusted with my actions

You should not be. You have (by the sounds of it) a legitimate medical condition with a real and traumatic root cause. You have made the brave first step of admitting this to yourself and to others. This is a sign that an inner part of you does not want to be held hostage by your condition. You must keep this momentum going - do not lose this desire to get better. If you can, tell more people; family, friends, medical professionals, therapists are all there to support you through your problems. Do not hide away, do not feel like you are to blame. Would you feel disgusted with yourself if you had a heart attack, or a stroke? This is no different, it is not your fault. Even if you read this and do not believe me, it is irrelevant. No one is judging you (or if they are, who cares?). You must focus on the process of getting better, and the best way that I can see is to maintain an open dialogue. Seek help - services are there for the sole purpose of helping people with conditions, please utilise them.
Firstly, there's no reason to be upset with yourself. You have a mental disorder. A LOT of people do, and yours is no different. What you're dealing with is just as much in your control as depression or anxiety would be. You didn't ask for it, and it's pretty clear you want to change things. You aren't even doing anything wrong.

Really there's only one solution. Look up your insurance, and find a therapist that's covered. Meet with them, feel if it's a good fit, and starting attending. This is all related to when you were a kid, which a therapist will know EXACTLY how to help you with. Trust me.

I know it feels like a lot right now, but I can promise you what you're dealing with is extremely treatable. All it takes is that first step.

Good luck!
This is seriously fucked up and I'm having a horrible time processing everything, so I kind of just wanted to vent. Yesterday I went to pick up my friends at their apartment, and found their neighbor hanging from the railing of his balcony. It took me a moment to even process what I was seeing. I dialed 911 and then ran upstairs to get my friends. There was nothing that could be done, it was too late. After the longest 5 minutes of my life, the police and medics arrived to secure the area and get him down. His kid came home shortly after that. Crisis workers came to the apartment to debrief with us about what we'd seen and offer support. 

I had a plan to kill myself three months ago to the day, and had gotten about halfway through the pills I was going to take before I realized that someone would find me and their life would be seriously fucked up. I went to the hospital, spent a week in the psych unit on a 2 MD hold, and 2 months of day hospitalization. I have had a long history of major depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I know how it feels to be at the point where you have to end the suffering. I feel for him. But I also feel a lot of anger toward him, and feel awful for feeling that way. If I hadn't found him, it would have been his kid. Or the lady downstairs, who opened her door to see what all the screaming was about, and found this guy literally hanging a few feet from her door.

I see his dead face everywhere. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I see his fixed, blown pupils on everyone. I don't know this guy and he's everywhere. I don't know how cops/EMS personnel deal with shit like this on a regular basis. I really don't. How do you get through trauma with prior mental health issues?
To get through trauma, you need to get help. Make an appt with a therapist that specializes in trauma and PTSD. I'm sorry this happened to you. 
I wish I could helP but I haven't dealt with anything like this. I am so sorry that you experienced that. I think a grief counselor would help you
Yes I agree with the other two.  You are processing this in a very powerful way.  When you said that if you hadn't found him his kid would have, I felt a jolt like you were a divine agent for that child's protection.  Also the fact that you understand so deeply what someone who wants to die goes through makes this experience all the more intense.  If you can talk to a therapist, it might help you to work through all those feelings so that the experience becomes part of your power and purpose for staying here on Earth, rather than one that drags you under.  Your anger is completely understandable and is an indication of how far you have come since your own suicide experience.
Sounds like you were there for a reason, OP. There is no right or wrong way to feel about this. Anger, frustration, anything.


As someone who also suffers from suicidal thoughts (albeit more mild than yours and often OCD - triggered), I'm glad to hear that you just had such an intense connection to the importance of life. Hang on to that, you helped a lot of people by being here and I hope this experience can help you too.
Please do not feel bad about being angry. You are very strong and wise to have processed this this way. I cannot even imagine. I love what you took from this situation, and hope that it will help you if you're in a bad place in the future. This is a perspective that we don't often hear or think of, but it's important. Maybe you can help others too by continuing to share your story.
I'm so sorry you went through this. I know what that shock feels like to see a dead person, but I can't imagine to see one who had a similar situation as you did. 

My grandmother passed away from a major heart attack when I came home one night and I had the biggest panic attack I've ever had. Her stomach was bloated, her legs purple, and she felt so cold. She had a lifeline necklace on and I was so angry at her for not pressing the button. The paramedic said she might not have had time or the ability to press it, but she was depressed and she may have not wanted to. The only lingering effect is that now when I see my mom sleeping and I can't see her breathing, I have to stand there and watch her to see if she's alive.

As everyone says, a grief counselor will definitely help for the better. I was glad I was already in therapy at the time. There was nothing you could do and you can tell other people, like you are telling us, how you realized the ramifications of suicide.
There's really no words for what you experienced. The other comments nail the sentiment. I've lost a good friend to suicide, someone in the field of mental health, and I still hold some anger towards him for what he, knowingly, did to himself, his friends, his clients and his community.

Depending on where you are in the country, there may be some great resources. I always recommend the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for support (1-800-273-8255). Additionally, if you are in LA, there's a great support network via http://www.didihirsch.org/survivors-after-suicide. Finally, there's an amazing community of "survivors" of suicide via http://mypage.iu.edu/~jmcintos/therapists_mainpg.htm.

Sadly, this is still an emerging field in mental health. Take good care of yourself, and remember (as difficult or insignificant as it may be) you are not alone.
I'm so sorry that you had to experience all of this.
I hear you. That's a terribly tough situation to be in. I want to explain to you something called the ironic rebound effect. When we try not to think about something, it rebounds back even stronger and it's much much harder to stop thinking about. Writing it out on here in sure helped loads. Just know, there are people here who care about you and will listen to what you need to say. 
I've read your post a dozen times and it totally makes me weepy. Thank you so much for your kind encouragement. Right now, it's hard to see how anything good could possibly come from this, because it's honestly fucked up. But now more than ever I'm determined to live and be there for my family and friends. I'm in school to become a nurse and even prior to this, had been considering working in inpatient psychiatry, or a substance abuse treatment facility. I will be okay. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but I know I'll be okay.

I hope this man, whoever he is, is free from suffering and whatever demons tormented him while he was alive. I hope his kid is not feeling guilty or shameful, and is in a safe, loving place. I saw him talking to the crisis workers, and he couldn't have been any older than 14. 

Thank you, and everyone else who has posted here, and those who have messaged me their stories privately, for being so gentle with me. Be kind to yourselves, too.
I'm so sorry about your traumatic experience. I can't even imagine the shock you felt finding her, having seen her alive and fine earlier. I'm encouraged to hear that you're healing with time. 

I'm a CNA on a hospital inpatient cardiology unit and have seen countless deaths through the years, some expected, some not. We may not let on easily, but each death hurts. We sneak away to supply closets, cry, then fix our makeup and get back to work. But this guy's death on Thursday was undeniably intentional, in a relatively public setting, and in broad daylight--I think that is what makes it beyond disturbing to me. 

I still feel like this is some sick joke. Like he'll pop out from behind a corner and be like, "Haha, fooled you, you shoulda seen the stupid look on your face."
Hey, thanks so much. What you said means a lot to me. I'm reading some of the scholarly articles on ironic rebound effect right now, and it's a really interesting phenomenon. I can't just *not* think about it, and as much as I hate thinking about it, it has been really helpful to talk, either in person or on here. 

Yesterday I met up with my friend (the one whose apartment this happened outside of) and we just talked it over for a few hours--what we saw, how we feel now, the strange things that trigger us, difficulties with work and interacting with other people, etc. We both agreed that it's been most helpful to get our thoughts off our chests and verbalize them as they occur, rather than just ruminating. She and her husband haven't been back to the apartment, other than to grab a few belongings. They don't think they'll ever go back. 

Apparently he was holding a paper plate with writing on it--my friends didn't see what it said. I don't even remember that being there. I don't think I would want to know. Thinking about that really freaked me out. Through the years I've seen a few suicide notes from patients we've gotten at work, and those really stuck with me. 

I've recently started on a low dose of propranolol and it seems to be helping with the physical effects of anxiety--the shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, palpitations, nausea... I know things will get easier over time, but it's still so fresh right now. 
I'm glad I can help and I know that you will heal, hell typing that out must have felt really good and you seem to have a great awareness already. This quote about meditation really stuck with me. "We don't meditate and practice mindfulness to get rid of the negative thoughts, but rather to restore the good thoughts. Breathing in I calm my body breathing out I smile ." I love thich nat Hahn. 

On a side note I have been really interested in the role nature plays on the healing process. Sometimes going to the woods can help make things more clear for us, while I know we are nature and it's everywhere I mean with a park outside a city if possible. Just wanted to offer that as a helpful safe space and quiet area to be.
I have borderline personality disorder.

And I have heard so many times people warning others to stay away from people like me. We're total psychos, crazies, fucking mental. I have seen so many times people writing that I don't deserve love, respect or even a right to live. This is exhausting.

But I am not that. We are not all psycho stalkers or manipulative bitches and I believe even them have the right to live. Yes, our illness doesn't excuse the abuse we may commit, not at all and you have the right to hate your ex who manipulated you. But remember that when you say "don't date people with BPD" you are also hurting innocent people who happen to suffer from the illness.

I always try to see the positive things, even in my illness. I may experience sadness or anger in an extremely intense way but I also experience happiness in a way few people will. And I have a lot of empathy (so much it can be funny sometimes). But it is getting so hard to stay that way when so many people are reminding you that you're worthless because you share an illness with their ex or mother.

Again, I am not a stalker and I try my hardest to not manipulate (tho I'll admit, I sometimes do without realizing). I really try so hard to recover, to not be an "obsessive abusive bitch" as so many people have called me. I am just an 19 y/o girl who sometimes stay up at night in order to create a whole new languages because I am feeling happy and motivated and who will choose the saddest looking plush to make it happy. And it is unfair for you* to tell me that I don't deserve love, or that I should be euthanized.

hey I have bpd as well, I get this a lot too. promise you that you're brilliant and lovely. i think we're more compassionate than most ! hope things are goin alright for you. we deserve love and happiness as much as anyone else. maybe more, since our lives have been kinda shit up til now. 

 hang on in there. keep rocking. all that jazz. you're doing great. x
Diagnosed with BPD two years ago and I'll admit, I was a manipulative, lying, overly emotional person. I did not enjoy these parts of myself but stuck through it with consistent therapy and medication. Today, I am mindful of the BPD tendencies and able to either control it, or immediately own up to my behavior. Do not allow any person to make you feel less for something out of your control. All you can do is decide if you are going to fight or secede, recovery is possible. Living proof. Good luck to you!
There is a lot of hate going about for BPD (although I don't like using that label), and it's not fair or deserved.  Most people don't realise the impossibly complex variables such people are trying to balance in their heads.  They'd feel pretty damn anxious if they had to think about them all.

I personally don't mind people with BPD.  You're welcome to chat to me, I am no stranger to intense out of control emotions.
Hey, I feel you. It also sucks because bpd presents different in everyone and in fact there are two types of bpd to describe general set of presentations classic vs quiet borderline. And yeah wtf like if someone is saying mean shit to you because of someone else they've experienced it's ridiculous I feel for you. I don't socialize enough to know if people would feel that way about me but it certainly makes me apprehensive because of the stigma. 
Hi, fellow BPD. Hang in there, and be tough. Plenty of us are doing our damn best to be better than the disorders we've got. You're right, we didn't choose to be like this. 


I have to remind myself almost on the daily to be more gentle, be kind, take active measures to empathize and be more considerate than the folks I see around me. Some days (alright, weeks) are better than others in that department, but I have a better handle on myself and my impulses than I would say I did a few years ago.

Keep trying and don't give up. You aren't these people's ex, or their family member (who's just that totally psychotic - everyone seems to have one to compare when BPD comes up, eh?). Be mindful, and you can be in a better place than anyone who'd hate you and wish you dead for having BPD.

You've got plenty of us here alongside you trying to do the same. /r/BPD 
Regardless of how a person acts, they deserve to be treated with respect, basic human respect. I'm sorry that hasn't always been extended to you. 

Like another person posted, BPD is a description of behaviors, interactions, emotional experiences, etc. It's not who you are, and it doesn't define what sort of treatment from others you deserve.

I'm not saying that others won't, or shouldn't, set boundaries with you, but that is not the same as being treated without respect for your value.
Sending you hugs OP <3 Nobody deserves hate for something that is truly beyond their control.

He's been going through extremely rough times the past year. Failing out of SDU, having to move in with his sister and her girlfriend. I can't really type more because my thoughts are completely scrambled from worrying. Please help with any advice you can give me. I don't know what else to do, who else to ask. I got this news today. And I'm pretty sure he's decided he's going to do it. Does the fact that he told me prior to the fact mean anything?
Try /r/suicidewatch for more advice. Good luck. 
The fact that he told you prior is a VERY good sign.  It's something of a cry for help and means that deep down, he may not want to do it.  I would help him find a therapist immediately if I were you.  If he's open to it, suggest psychiatric hospitalization.  It's heavily stigmatized of course, so he may be averse to the idea, but it can be helpful.  Tell him there's no shame in taking his mental health seriously enough to go to the hospital.
If you can, get him to go to a local emergency room at a hospital - they'll evaluate him there. You can also call ahead if you are going to an emergency room and often you'll be seen quicker. 

If you are in the US: you can also call a local county crisis line (they can send trained people over if it seems like he is in imminent harm of hurting himself), but make sure you call the line for the county he is in. 

 You can also call a national suicide crisis line like Lines for Life at 800-273-8255. Ideally you can call with your friend, but if your friend won't call, you can also call yourself and ask them to help you figure out your options to help him. They can help you out with what to say, too.  
Call the suicide hotline as been suggested by some of the folks here. 

Pay attention to what he does. Since he's made a statement about it, watch to see if he starts giving his stuff away. If he goes from angst to seemingly peaceful. These COULD be signs that he means it. 

The fact that he said something to you probably means he needs a friend to listen. As bummed as he is, try talking about funny things from your past, make plans for the future (nothing fancy, just try to plan things that you both like to do). This gives him something to aim for. 

Most iimportantly, don't try to act like he didn't make the sucide statement BUT you can talk about it without encouraging it or dismissing it. Tellilng you out loud is a good sign that he needs someone to listen and/or help him see that this is just a rough spot. 

If things seems to get more out of hand than you think you can handle, call the hot line (call them any way for tips and suggestions on how to help your friend through this).

At some point let him know just how aweful it would be for you to lose him. Be honest and let the emotions show through. 

Good luck
I think it's important to remember that you can't help him. He's going to need professional assistance and all you can do is your best to try and get him into treatment. Talking will be unlikely to do much. It's a good sign that he talked to you about it though because in my experience that's the hardest part. If he has a clear plan and you don't think you can talk him into going to the ER with you it's ok to call an ambulance or the police if you feel like he's in urgent danger. Good luck.
If you know he's going to act on his impulses call the police and get them to bring him in for an evaluation. Obviously you would want to try and convince him to bring himself in for treatment first, but the police are probably your best bet otherwise. 
Green_relief, please realize many thousands of psychiatrists are attempting to use reddit to advertise their violence/kidnapping/forced-druggings /etc.

They'll (of course) downvote anyone who disagrees.  

The truth is, listening to them is like listening to only a rapist, and not the rape victim.  

And there's practically no victims of their "help" (eg forced beatings/suffocating to drug someone, forced cloth taking, forced kidnapping)  who believe it helped them.

Suffering people seek help- actual help.  They do not seek state terror & violence.  

People go to psychiatrists, & psychiatrists betray them & beat/suffocate people into submissive slaves.  They destroy the lives of innocent people.  These are Nazi style atrocities, which fully destroy the victim as much as the psychiatrist can.  

And psychiatrists are making huge profits by committing these atrocities.
How about staying out of it? How about realising not everything is about you and your friend is has a right to their oen decisions. 

Or you could call doctors and turn their life into a clusterfuck of "treatments".
Please do not trust the people advocating violence. 

(Such as going to various "hospitals" which are actually simply prisons.)

No one has ever found violent rape-like (and for-profit) violence has made them less suicidal.  It just makes psychiatrists more money.  

---

Instead, *please offer actual help.*  

 - Talk, try hard to communicate, etc.  

 - See what you can do to help the person.

 - Create some new idea/plan for what to do in the future.

---

Psychiatrists destroy lives & their actual goal is to make money.  They make about $200k/year destroying people's lives.
Please do not advocate violence.  Rape-like violence where psychiatrists kidnap & take a person's cloth, then denigrate them etc is not a way to help people.  It's a way to make psychiatrists money.

I posted in the main thread about options which actually help.  The most helpful might be trying to create a new plan/goal for the future.
Don't call the cops.  That's almost always a bad idea.
Please do not post about something you clearly have no actual knowledge of. The majority of psychiatrists attempt to help people to the furthest extent of their ability. While I'm sure there is a misguided minority who do practice psychiatry simply for the financial benefits, it is certainly a minority.

Additionally, psychiatric hospitals are not prisons, at least not in my experience. They are refuges for these in need of exactly that, mental refuge. They provide constant monitoring of those who need it, as well as 24 hour access to help, both physically and mentally. The only comparison to a prison is in the security involved, but the goals of the institutions are completely different. A psychiatric hospital seeks to their patients alive and safe from themselves and each other, while a prison seeks to keep its prisoners imprisoned.
seconded!
cops are trained to use force, not talk down a crazy person. you need somebody trained in dealing with mental health crises.
there are plenty of examples of cops being called to suicide threats and killing the suicidal person.
the name Kelly Thomas is always worth remembering.

to reiterate, and imo it bears repeating:
COPS ARE NOT TRAINED TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND OFTEN RESORT TO USE OF FORCE WHEN CONFRONTING NONCOMPLIANT CRAZY PEOPLE
> who do practice psychiatry simply for the financial benefits

It doesn't matter what excuses they have.  They can claim it's "helping" all they want, but it's simply a fact that psychiatric prisons need slaves/prisoners to make money.  

> psychiatric hospitals are not prisons, a

Please use basic honesty.

They forcefully attack, kidnap, & force people where they can not leave.  

> They provide constant monitoring of those who need it, 

You're assuming guilt without due process.  People are accused of things which they did not consent to & would practically always deny if given a trial.

Any excuses from the slave owners (psychiatrists) that they're helping are dishonest.  Actual help is voluntary, & doesn't involve rape-like violence.

I've called LEO on my friend before when she was making threats. They went to her house, were able to talk her down and then brought her into protective custody where she was able to be taken and evaluated.

You are wrong, police are trained to deal with these types of situations. Obviously it will differ from department to department as to the depth and scale of the training but they are trained in assisting/helping the mentally ill and so forth.

MDMA. There is a difference. 
good enough of this bootstraps shit there's suffering people out there.

We do all the time.  


I hope it becomes more common.  


It's amazing to hear a whole classroom of 2nd graders to shout "Amygdala! Hippocampus! Frontal Lobes!" during emotional skills teaching time. 

Heres the deal.  Projections like "stigma", "jokes", and "invalidation" are rearranging deck chairs.  Projections factor in what people **feel** about feelings.  


We need to educate about feelings.  


If you just stick to education and neuroscience and present it as information that you can use to change your psycho-social landscape, "stigma" will die.  "Jokes" won't be taken personally.  "Invalidation" would be a figment to be wrestled out of your dream. 



Thank you for posting.  Be well. 
Yes
Yep, imho. 👌🏻🖖🏻👍🏻✌🏻️
If we teach kids about puberty, diet, and exercise, it follows that mental hygiene should be discussed...
Of course. 
Yes. I have lost 2 friends to suicide due to school related stress in the past 2.5 yrs. There have been around 10 suicides in my school, some even on campus in the past 3 years yet the administration covers it up and tries to play it off as not related to stress from work given. So to me, yes, this is a really important topic to discuss.
shut the fuck up

Yeah man I dont know, rings just have some kind of power.
I take two pills in the morning , I take to pills at night, I talk to pills in the afternoon it make me feel alright! 
What keeps your wife by your side is YOU...after the chemical imbalance is balanced by the meds. Never underestimate how much effort you put into the relationship. The med just makes it so you have more mental focus/energy/balance/whatever to put into it. 
Lamictal saved my life. 
What is it?
I haven't found the right combination of pills yet to keep me out of the morgue.  But I'm going to switch to a new psyciatrist on Monday, so hopefully that will improve things a bit.
My precious...
Take two pills before you take two pills, and then you take two more?
fucked up mine, whatever works for you
Nuprin^tm     

 *Little, yellow...different*
Escitalopram
Looks like clonazepam
Sublime reference. "Smoke two joints"
How did it fuck it up?
Minions?
Michelle Kwan?
Weird, it doesn't look anything like mine, they're white. I suppose different generic manufacturers may make them look different. 
How long did they take to work for you? My gf was prescribed them for BPD and they didn't do anything except cause extreme anxiety for the first week.
Escitalopram
... uh, yeah, I was going along with it. 
Terrible rash on my body.
Lexapro?
It keeps me from spiralling down into the depths of depression. 
Wanna trade? Mines look different. 
Basically. I take a cheaper brand called Nexito. 
I've been on it for 7 years. Can't function without it. It makes me tired though. 
Same here, I get super sleepy come afternoon. It also makes me 'twitch' alot, which can be quite annoying. Sometimes I get the shakes as well.  
But honestly, its worth it, I feel like I turn into a monster without it, foul moods, crippling depression and everything is either black or white (thanks BPD). 
I'm glad it's helped you! Have you considered adding meditation to the mix in your daily life?

Looks like maternal mortality has declined globally, so that's good at least.
Doesn't suicide affect males more? Or are we ignoring them because they aren't pretty? 
I think it's a well established fact that suicide affects males more, but it would seem that the statistics of mortality for teenage girls has changed in recent years, with suicide now being the leading cause, hence the news story. Whether this just applies to Australia or worldwide I don't know.
Because quite often, it's perceived that women who are suicidal are that way because society treats them unfairly while men who are suicidal are just seen as weak and unnecessary. At least, that's how it goes in the majority of my state. 
No we ignore them because they're worth ignoring. Men are supposed to be strong and stoic. It's okay for women to be emotional and unstable. Men who suffer from mental illness are worthless and should be embarrassed about being such a joke of a man. 

So they tell us anyway. I have trouble finding a therapist because there are very many who "don't work with men"

Thanks. 
The linked article is a bit misleading--the main reason suicide has become the leading cause of death is because the former leading cause, maternal mortality, has dropped. Which is actually a pretty great thing. And it's girls between 15 and 19, not just "teens."

Regarding boys, the leading cause of death for that age range is still accidents (unless you're Black and in the U.S., in which case it is, sadly, homicide) but suicide is up there, too. The most at-risk teen population when it comes to suicide is GLBT youth. 

Regarding your glib line about ignoring boys, teen suicide is a frequently researched topic--for both genders, and particularly for GLBT kids because that's the most at-risk population. 
It does, I went through that whole article wondering why the fuck it was focused on women rather than people.

Hit me as similar to the whole "We need to do something, there are twice as many homeless women as there were ten years ago!", forgetting, of course, that like 99% of homeless people are men.
It's not talking about women in general, it's talking about TEENAGED girls.
[deleted]
Aye, do we have any statistics on teenage boys? Cos I bet their highest cause of death is suicide too. I wouldn't be surprised if there are more.
Except the topic never is men's issues. Obviously there's a difference but why am I suddenly seeing posts about suicide rates now that it's a women's issue when nobody seems to really care that men commit suicide on a consistently higher rate than women already?

It's not an us vs them narrative and I don't *need* to do anything. I'm allowed to ask questions and I'm certainly allowed to ask why virtually nothing is still being done to help men who commit suicide while more is being done to help young girls. The two are not mutually exclusive so stop trying to shut people down when they try to talk about it.
The point of the article is to show that suicide is now the biggest killer of teenaged girls because it wasn't before. We already know that suicide affects more males than females (in the U.S.). 

See: https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures
[deleted]
Exactly my point. It's a bit like "Men are killing themselves, who gives a fuck? Oh *women* are dying now, too? We should do something about it!".
1) Nope. I very rarely see articles specifically aimed at males otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation. Scrolled through as many as I could be bothered to on this sub and none were aimed specifically at males... Would be interested to see some better statistics on the ratio there though, as I could be wrong. As weak as anecdotal evidence is, I personally never see articles addressing male needs without specifically searching for them.

2a) Blaming men for their difficulties is unhelpful when it's a deep-rooted societal and evolutionary problem.

3) I do. I'm a mental health clinician in the NHS and ran a men's group for the mental health charity Mind in my local area for about 7 months, single-handedly. Don't presume to know what I do or do not do in addition to commenting on reddit.

4) (2b) Blaming men for their difficulties is unhelpful when it's a deep-rooted societal and evolutionary problem.

>One of the biggest obstacles is hypermasculine culture - a culture that **all of society** are responsible for endorsing and maintaining. Men are not seeking help because they are being taught by their **fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, brothers and sisters, friends, colleagues and media** to be stoic, to do things alone, to not lean on other people. Men are **frightened to take advantage of** the positive benefits of psychiatry and caring for their mental health. And these **attitudes** are the ones consistently being addressed by the campaigns and organisations surrounding men's mental health issues **but reinforced, ignored or dismissed by wider society**.

FTFY

These campaigns, charities and movements are consistently shouted down by feminists and funders because they're seen as detracting from more important (read: female) issues. Men are seen as disposable utilities, not human beings. Again, I reference the outcry over an increase in women's homelessness despite the vast majority of homeless individuals being male. Hillary Clinton's comments on war victims. #heforshe campaigns. #yesallwomen ring a bell? Look at any issues surrounding rape or domestic violence; do you not find them to be a little gynocentric, generally? There was a poster, in my mental health charity building, addressing battery towards **women** with incorrect statistics and no mention of males or where they could receive support. This new article on how suicide is now a serious issue for young females. So it is. It's been a serious issue for *all* males for god-knows how long. What is being done in wider society to address it? I would argue tantamount to nothing. It's getting worse, if anything.

5) You say I'm disregarding their needs when I'm not. I'm merely questioning why I'm to care more about this or fight for more investment in solving this  problem when there is an overwhelmingly unhelpful attitude towards men in society and the only efforts to change it are tokenistic or sabotaged. I will accept and respond to the plight of this one, small section of society more appropriately when the needs of the half of society to which I belong are being attended to.
[deleted]
Fair enough. How about reframing it? I'm sure you can't argue with the idea that feminist campaigns and support services for females are far more in abundance than those for males. Attention and commitment to resources is the issue I'm having, not a raw number of articles. This post is merely a symptom of that issue, in my eyes. You say you see plenty of posts, I don't. Stalemate. But there's no way you can argue men receive as much attention or protection as women. That is why posts like this annoy me.

Dismiss it all you like. That makes you ignorant, not smart. You can't blame men alone for something all of society contributes to. I agreed and explicitly stated when I corrected you that men promote these attitudes also. However, to jump to the idea that the issue is something men can just fix on their own with no assistance from the media or the government is a leap too far. Unless, of course, you truly believe all men are suddenly going to go "You know, I've been exploited my entire life. No more!". As wonderful as that would be, it is unrealistic and unhelpful.

Why is it not the time or place? I'm sorry but you don't get to decide that just because you find it distasteful. I'm not saying this isn't a problem, what I am saying is that I don't see why I should care and commit *any* attention to this one small group when an entire half of society is, and has been for some time, suffering from a similar problem which is being ignored. Men are four times more likely to take their own lives compared to women. 400% more of an issue and you want me to do something about this small group? How about a quarter of me gives a shit and the rest doesn't. How about society devotes four times more resources in helping males who are self-harming or suicidal (not likely). It's like asking people to care about a broken leg when the person next to you is on fire. Sure, your leg needs fixing and probably in a different way but should we not put out that fire, first? Maybe that person on fire would be willing to help fix broken legs once they're not on fucking fire anymore.

Have they done a court ordered psychiatrist evaluation to see if she's truly schizophrenic? All I saw was a psychologist testifying she's interviewed the girl enough times to conclude the girl believes slenderman is real..
I think people should understand what the criminal offense was. Although I do agree that she need psychiatric treatment and they should not treat her this way.


I think that many people may just look at this and get up in arms before realize what the crime was and bothering to look into it. Perhaps in the same way people will look at the crime and get up in arms without looking further into it.


http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2957709/Inside-notebook-Slender-Man-stabbing-suspect-12-list-supplies-attempted-killing-mutilated-Barbies-message-said-love-killing-people.html

The petition glosses over the nature of the crime and some of the background. That said, the behavior strongly suggests there is mental illness, and certainly not expected and healthy behavior for a child her age.  If in fact she is diagnosed with schizophrenia, the response needs to be treatment.  

The lawyer's points are valid. She is already damaged in some way to have done the crime, but to incarcerate her under the conditions described, that is not rehabilitation, nor will it help her behavior.  
I don't care WHAT this child did (and yes, I know what she did); NO 12-yr-old should be tried as an adult but especially one who has been diagnosed with a serious mental illness.  I would consider her being kept in prison and treatment for her condition being withheld as "cruel and unusual," particularly since she hasn't been tried/convicted/sentenced at this time, as I understand.  What about innocent until proven guilty?  Not anymore in the USA...

If she had epilepsy, she would be given her medications, I assume.  So why is mental illness treated differently???  Ignorance and prejudice, plain and simple.  Is that what our legal system is about now?  It is a global embarrassment that we treat people, especially children and others with mental special needs, this way in our legal system.
Ah this case.    How is a 12yo a flight risk?
While this is an extremely controversial case, I plead you to have a heart and look past her crime and understand that she is human and deserving of treatment just like any other person. You wouldn't deny a person in prison treatment for pneumonia, would you? So why let her suffer untreated? 
If anything, I think details like that make it far more obvious she is mentally ill and should not be denied treatment. 
Seriously, how is it that we understand that a 12 year old has not developed the mental capacity to vote, drink, drive a car, work, drop out of school, or consent to sex, but we can't seem to acknowledge that they should not be held to the same standard as adults when they've committed a crime? How is it that children are not given the same rights as adults, but they are given the same punishments?! How is this not a human rights violation?

Mental illness or not, a 12 year old should not be seen as an adult in a court of law. A 12 year old is NOT and adult!

And I just don't get how access to medical care is not seen as a basic human right in the US. What is wrong with us? We can't get basic healthcare, and no one bats an eye about the fact that [we have the highest incarceration rate in the world] (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html?pagewanted=all).

As usual, I'm ashamed to be an American.

Exactly. My sister has a slew of mental illnesses and gets shunned whenever she does something particularly violent. People find it shocking when they find out that she's still my best friend after she attacked me in front of my daughter two years ago. She's not a monster, she's just unstable and needs treatment. 
There are people who would gladly deny medical care to prisoners.  It's not that rare an attitude that prison is all about the ultimate punishment.

The fact of the case is that it was exceptionally and unusually violent.  That does need to be kept in mind.  It also needs to be kept in mind that she is a child with a mental illness, and that might be treatable.  
you'd be surprised I was having panic attacks in jail once and basically passing out on the floor and all they gave me was an aspirin.
I agree. 
Some of us in this country are very concerned with the state of health care and incarceration rates.  

I am not ashamed to be an American.  I am upset that certain interests would disgrace the name of America with these things. 
I'm curious if you know what her crime was? although I want to add I completely agree that she needs treatment!
Jails are not mental health facilities, nor do they act like that. If you are mentally ill in jail, you are in a bad place to be.  
I don't know... for some reason shame is seen as a bad thing in this country and often there's a sense that you are anti-american if you feel ashamed. There are times where I am not ashamed- sometimes America does good things. But I think shame is a very valuable feeling- it tells us when something needs to change. I want to be proud of our country, but I have high standards. We must expect better from ourselves to earn my pride. 

Many people are proud of America's ideals. That is fine. I am not ashamed of those ideals. My opinion, though, is that a country is defined not by it's ideals, but by it's actions.

In America it is very controversial and against the grain to say that you're "ashamed" of your country. I say it anyway, because I believe that we need to hear it, because I think we as a country need to acknowledge and take responsibility for the problems we have. And honestly, many of these problems are quite shameful.

I think this is good motivational material
Thanks guys,  has helped me out a fine or two when I want dealing well. 
I'm glad this is under mental health.  I'd say most people take mental sanity for granted.  
I finally have a diagnosis! I have EUPD and Psychosis. Along with depression & Anxiety... I've been referred for the help i need... hopefully I will be better 
Good news! I wish you the very best.  

Best of luck! 
EUPD is BPD right? 
think of getting a diagnosis as a step further of better knowing yourself, and a stepping stone to living a happy life.

there is a huge stigma with borderline personality D/O (EUPD), but it is the most "treatable" personality disorder, using DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy). the more you learn about it,  the more you'll learn why you are the way you are. it doesn't mean this has to be forever, there are lot of therapy options to help change the way you think and the relationships you have with other people. besides going to a pyschiatrist and figuring out what meds you should take, i would suggest buying a DBT workbook on amazon and doing it daily 
I'm sorry for my ignorance, but what is EUPD? And congratulations on being diagnosed! Not many people understand how damn epic it is to finally understand why they feel the way they do!
The vast majority of people get better with help, you may rest now, you're in good hands.
Ha! Yeah, I told my wife yesterday "see honey, I new I wasn't crazy. Look, they said I'm crazy." People fear issuing a diagnosis but for someone who's been dealing with shit for many years and it's difficult to know which direction to go. Now you know and hopefully will be on the road to remission. Dr's are sometimes like mechanics, changing the brakes when all you needed was brake fluid all along. 

The break for me was the Dr who wasn't my Dr, but a random person in my life. She simply stopped to make sure I was ok and almost immediately knew what was going on. She acted as an advocate to get me to the right Drs she was networked with. How did she know? Her son has the same issues and his story was similar to mine. High functioning, successful and insightful. That Dr. very well may have saved my life. 
Congrats! I'm sure this will be the start of a lot of growth as you better understanding yourself. EUPD/BPD has VERY favorable outcomes through DBT and other therapeutic techniques. 
Thank you for all the lovely comments 💕 still getting over the shock of being told I'm emotionally unstable but, is reading leaflets they've given me and doing some research on everything she told me x
I agree completely, a diagnosis is the first step in sorting things out. I'm really happy you were able to put a name to your struggle, best of luck :)
Thank you x
Yes x
Eupd is icd, and bpd is dsm. There are very slight differences, but for all intents and purposes, they are the same thing 
I have just purchased a workbook - thank you for that suggestion. 
I'm on antidepressants and I've been referred for DBT and the early intervention team as I get quite severe psychotic episodes. They're going to try DBT with my first off and if I feel like it's not working etc they will discuss any medication. 
Thank you for taking the time to comment xx
Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, aka Borderline Personality Disorder. IIRC first is ICD specific, the latter being DSM and others.
i hope you get better 
Thank you!
Thank you x

The content sounds very interesting but I'm a little baffled that no sources are cited. 
Could eating a vegan or vegetarian diet change your gut flora? [The Health Advantage of a Vegan Diet: Exploring the Gut Microbiota Connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4245565/)
There's been a few studies, but they're inconclusive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut–brain_axis#Anxiety_and_mood_disorders
I'm particularly focused on the second paragraph of the article:

>Several studies have also highlighted the fact that gastrointestinal problems are associated with dramatic changes in the mood. One such particular research, conducted by the Hungarian scientists in 2009, found some eye-opening relationship between gut and mental illness as mentioned below:

Yet no sources for these studies are present - are they missing?
I asked my mum if she can get me some professional help. Admittedly it was over email at midnight because i don't really feel comfortable talking to my parents about this stuff, but still.
Just something I thought I might brag about. :P
Hey there, and congrats! Baby steps, but steps nevertheless :)

Hugs, and I hope things become better for you soon! :)
Well you're ahead of me.
Good for you! It's so important to get help when you need it. Let me know what she says.
Bravo for life's little victories  :D
It's tough opening up about mental illness, you took a brave and important step and should already feel better about yourself.

I am a burden.
These made me smile and I like how soft and gentle the illustrations are.

I laughed at "I don't mind if you cancel our plans" because it is relatable. I am usually the person cancelling plans, so I am very, very understanding when friends do this to me.

I also liked "This too shall pass" because sometimes I need to be reminded of that.
Do you absolutely know that it's true that you are a burden? How do you react when you think the thought, "I am a burden?" How would you feel without that thought? Turn it around: I am not a burden. My thoughts are a burden. Is that as true or truer? 
Sometimes I feel that way too, that's why the message is so important. I know having depression makes this hard to believe, but you aren't a burden.. you are deserving of compassion, love, and support. 
Thank you so much! <3 

The cancelled plans card is definitely one from my own experience. Sometimes having mental health issues makes it so hard to get out of the house. My closest friends and I share an understanding that it's okay to cancel plans on bad days.

I really appreciate your comment/feedback :)
I am a heavy burden on the shoulders of the society. Bipolar Disorder is (literally) killing me.
You're welcome! <3

I bookmarked the page and might buy a few cards in the future. I hadn't exactly planned on buying any, but you seem so sweet and I can think of a few people who would appreciate receiving a card like this.
Thank you! Really, the support means so much to me. I really appreciate it :)


It makes me tear up when I see stuff like this. Improvements in the mental heath field are always amazing, no matter how small or big they might be. 

Look forward to the future.
Prof. David. E. Nichols recently wrote a small article explaining the process of getting psilocybin approved for medical use: [When will Medicinal 'Magic Mushrooms' be Legalized?](http://reset.me/story/long-doctors-can-prescribe-magic-mushrooms/)

Some excerpts: 

>How much will the Phase 3 studies cost? As a not-for-profit institute, our costs have been lower than they might be if we were a for-profit pharmaceutical company. Even so, as an average, treatment is costing us approximately $25,000 per patient. That includes costs for clinical treatment rooms, medication, therapists, and many other ancillary costs required to carry out a clinical study. It would be reasonable to expect total costs for a Phase 3 trial of this nature to be on the order of $7.5-8 million.


>Many people also ask, “Aren’t drug companies interested in psychedelic medicine?” The answer, unfortunately, is no. Psychedelic medicines have been around so long that they are no longer patentable, and they work after one or sometimes two treatments. There is no money to be made with a non-patentable drug that is given only once or twice in a lifetime. Typical drug treatments are given daily, sometimes two or more times a day, and for many medical conditions the treatment can last years, or even a lifetime.
I don't know how I feel about psychedelics. I read an article about ayahuasca and how tests were being done and magically curing depression. That was maybe a year ago, or a little less. I was really tired, if 10 is the day you kill yourself, I was consistently at a 9. I made my own ayahuasca and drank it. Singled out, it was the worst thing I've ever experienced. You don't know torture until you lose your ability to gauge time and think you're stuck in an infinite loop.. However.. sometimes things get worse before they get better. Even you feel like you're going to die you really can't. The following months afterward were pretty hellish - I became obsessed with philosophy and meaning(or the lack of). A few times I was spiked lower than ever before, a 9.9 a couple of days, but overall I guess I'm better off? Ayahuasca forces mindfulness upon you for better or for worse. And I've managed to use it to stop my negative thoughts, and start working toward the future. I'm on 3 antidepressants now and taking better care of myself, but I still don't enjoy life. I'm a 5-7 most days but I just feel like this whole thing is a shit deal and I'm angry at and jealous of people who don't realize it. I'd be pretty interested in trying mushrooms. Ayahuasca is pretty much the king of bad trips - you will almost never have a fully enjoyable trip. Its used to bring out the bad and confront it which it certainly does. So I think I could handle some of the tamer psychedelics pretty well.

Overall I'd say that psychedelics are beneficial, but heres what I'd do differently. 

1. Do not do them alone. I don't care what kind of loner you think you are, theres no way you are better off doing hallucinogens alone the first time. Just having someone there to tell you that you're not dying and keep you from hurting yourself if you're doing something stronger. I fell off a bed and fucked up my shins by shoving them under the bedframe which I didn't feel until the next day because I was no longer one with this realm.

2. Don't yolo your dose. Less is better if you're unsure. Also don't make it yourself if you have any other choice. Most of the stuff you can make, theres hardly any way to accurately dose it. 

3. Start with tamer drugs? I did ayahuasca and I've never even smoked weed before. I think most of the negatives that came with it were a result of my own haphazard methods and stupidity. 
[deleted]
Sure. The things you see and the state you're left in afterwards completely change your perspective. I was a firm atheist most of my life, and I'm still unaffiliated with any religion and likely will continue to be. But what I believe now is closer to Buddhism. Theres just no way that consciousness can cease to be - its a law of the universe like gravity. I don't think these things, I know them(regardless of whether or not they are true). Its a weird drug. I fully understand how it sounds, and I can appreciate the firm atheist perspective, but its an experience that can't be appreciated until you've had it. Like trying to explain sound to a deaf person or color to a blind guy.

Although, you wouldn't know I've changed unless you ask me these specific questions. I'm not advocating ayahuasca to everyone I meet, and I'm really not any more spiritual than I was before. I just have facts that I can't prove and I didn't have before. I guess if I had to sum up the changes I experienced - I gained mindfulness that you only get after lots of meditation, and I now have some form of faith. And that I can survive some horrible psychological torture.
[deleted]
Well, honestly I barely remember anything of my trip. I 'woke' from it with just a feeling of terror and whenever I think about it I just imagine horror. I do not remember hallucinations - the most I saw was vivid colors before I blacked out. I believe that I overdosed in which case most people do just that - black out. However, I do remember experiencing ego death. Everything that I am was sucked away, and yet there was still something observing. Thats the main thing that shook me. With no access to memories or ability to think, there was still something seeing through me. 

I think how you end up afterwards depends on what kind of person you are. From a young age I needed empirical evidence for everything. Anything you want me to believe you better be able to show me. So, after having a demonstration of what seemed to be consciousness persisting without me, I needed a suitable explanation and spent months learning about different philosophies until I found one that seemed to fit. If I hadn't blacked out and I had seen hallucinations, perhaps I'd be looking for ways to satisfy myself that telepathy is real. If you drink aya, you'll see and feel things that you will have a burning need to explain and you will do so in different ways depending on what kind of person you are. Perception is your reality.

I think it's primarily the mindfulness that is the benefactor. There's been studies done that have shown aya is basically condensed liquid meditation. The changes it causes in the brain resemble those that experienced meditators undergo. And this will happen regardless of what you do or don't see during the trip.
TL;DR: I need advice on how to get help for being a pedophile. If i tell a therapist/psychiatrist the first thing he'll do is call the police, I fear. If word got out of my affliction the ignorant in my life will make no distinction between pedophile and child molester, and my life would be over. I need a proffesional's assurance that i can indeed get help without ruining my own life in the process. (END TLDR)  
  
I am a pedophile.

I don't want to be. I wish with all my fiber that I could be rid of this disease. I come from a long, long line of child abusers on both sides of my family, i am legitimately unsure of who in my family is or is not a pedophile, there are a lot. I was abused, and now the plague has spread to me. 
  
It's made even worse by the fact that i still live at home with the shit stain that abused me, and this shit stain still denies that it did it at all and gets violently defensive at the suggestion. Faggot.
  
Anyhoo, I am what one would call a celibate pedophile. I do not harm kids, i do not view, share, or have any interactions whatsoever with child pornography. I limit my releases to fantasy, animated stuff (gray area i know), and nudsit/naturist imagery. 
  
The very thought of hurting a kid horrifies me. Yet at the same time i cannot help these unnatural urges.  
  
Is pedophilia a recognized mental disorder with treatment options? Will a psychologist/therapist be mandated to tell the authorities just in case i have abused anyone? 

What kind of professional should i seek out? Therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, what's the difference and what kind should i go to? 

I do not have health insurance at the moment so i can't afford it any way, but should that change I would like to know what i can do to get better. 

thanks.

Brave of you to seek help! Your comment about how you come from "a long line" makes me wonder if it is genetic and/or environmental?
It certainly is a legit disorder and you can definitely get the help you need. Find a psychiatrist in your network and talk to them. They will not call the police. It's very honorable/brave to seek help!
I would go in and make it very very clear that you have not acted on your urges and intend to continue to abstain. There is nothing to legitimately report to the police in this case. That is no guarantee that they will not report anyway, but they *should not*. They would be over-reacting if they did and it may even be grounds for a lawsuit if they did report in that case (I am not a lawyer, and I say this more as something the professionals should have as incentive *not* to over-react and report than as recourse for you after the fact.)

I would also go in with a very clear idea of what you want out of treatment, what you are willing to do, and what you are not willing to do. For example, a lot of professionals will pressure you to address these sorts of situations directly with your abuser, but you know whether that is a good idea or not (this happened to me a lot). You can remain open to doing some of these things later on, but still lay ground rules up front. 

Psychiatrists primarily prescribe medications, only very occasionally actually doing therapy. Therapists and psychologists do talk therapy, different ones use different techniques (briefly, psychologists have a lot more training). They can also refer you to a psychiatrist if they think medication will help and a psychiatrist can refer you for therapy if they think therapy will help. Whoever you see, I would also ask them if they are willing to refer you elsewhere if they think there is someone else who can help you better. 
If you do go, try to find someone who is not hostile towards pedophiles. Some mental healthcare professionals can react badly to this, due to their own abuse, or working with abuse survivors. Some professionals just don't really know much about this subject. Also avoid people who work with criminals, because they will have a skewed view.

Also, you can be very selective about what you say. I wouldn't mention the nudism photos, or the drawings.

I am a pedophile myself. I have had negative experiences with mental healthcare professionals, but mostly because they were not the right kind of specialist, and I was not willing to be honest with them.

What helped me more than anything was when my family doctor put me on SSRI antidepressants. **(I am not a doctor, and you shouldn't take my advice as medical advice.)** This drug helped me by reducing my sex drive, and alleviating my depression. The drug is *escitalopram* (brrand name Lexapro/Cipralex). But it is not a quick fix if you still have psychological issues to work out. The first time I was put on antidepressants, I was not ready to heal, and it actually increased my suicidal thoughts. But once I had sorted out my issues, it helped immensely.

Good luck.
I don't think they'll call the police unless you admit to planning a crime or have committed a crime.
If you arent a risk to offend it is illegal for them to break confidentiality and report you.
That almost sounds like the difference between being suicidal and having suicidal thoughts.

A professional wouldn't (shouldn't?) involve authorities unless there's a clear plan or desire to follow through on that plan.
We have a post stickied at /r/pedofriends for paedophiles seeking help if you're interested.
There's nothing wrong with an attraction you cannot help, as long as you do not act on any related desires.

Just like being gay or straight, pedophilia cannot be "fixed" or "changed" - it's been well established that "conversion therapy" does not and can not work.

It is recognized as a mental disorder, though you do not have pedophilic disorder if it does not cause you distress. Likewise, more and more people are pushing for it to be classified as a sexual orientation, as it fits all the criteria of one. Read more [here](http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2013/12/22/is_pedophilia_a_sexual_orientation.html) and [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/134033172/Michael-C-Seto-2012-ASB-is-Pedophilia-an-Orientation).

I'm also a non-offending/celibate pedophile. While I'm not a member of the community, I've heard great things about VirPed.org. You should check them out. Likewise, if you'd like to talk for any reason (to a fellow non-offending/celibate pedophile who has been in the same place as you), **feel free to PM me.**

Unfortunately going to a therapist is not in your best interest unless you make it *100% clear you have not and never will offend, and completely trust this therapist.* You'd be better off talking to a confidante or friend about it - just someone who you can trust. There are only mandatory reporting laws in the U.S. if the therapist or whoever believes you are at "risk of offending" - but oftentimes these laws are *not followed*. Unfortunately, it's a huge problem in the U.S. that we'd rather put people in jail rather than getting them help (in regards to just more than pedophilia, too). If you're in Germany, though, you're in luck - they have a [great system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_Project_Dunkelfeld).

I'm very sorry you suffered abuse. What you *can* do is seek help for that, and get whoever abused you the punishment they deserve. I do want to debunk two myths you alluded to in referencing that, though:

1. Victims of abuse are not more likely to grow up to be pedophiles/child abusers. "In searching for causes of pedophilia, researchers have largely dismissed the popular belief that abuse in childhood plays an important role. Studies show that few victims grow up to be abusers, and only about a third of offenders say they were molested." [Source.](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/jan/20/more-viewing-pedophilia-as-orientation/)

2. Most people who abuse children do it out of dominance, not attraction. **Most child sex offenders/abusers are not pedophiles**. "It is a fact that real pedophiles account for only 20 percent of sexual abusers." [Source.](http://gawker.com/5941037/born-this-way-sympathy-and-science-for-those-who--want-to-have-sex-with-children)

It is not a "plague." It has not "spread to you." While you may be attracted to children, **it is in your power not to act on these urges.** You seem to be doing great so far - I believe in you. You said the thought of hurting a kid horrifies you. And why would you hurt someone you love? You can break the cycle of abuse.
> It's made even worse by the fact that i still live at home with the shit stain that abused me,

This might be your biggest problem & I hope you'll focus on changing that.  

By the way, all sorts of people have weird sexual fetishes they never actually do.  It's normal to just think about all sorts of things & not actually do them.

And if your idea of a "pedo" is being attracted to (eg) a 17 year old, that's not a real pedo to any honest person.  

> [the people saying "get help!"]

This sub is full of people who appear to be professional state "psychologists" of various forms, and they will tell everyone to "seek [what makes psychologists money]".

(And they call that "help.")

Of course (in reality) if you go to the state & say (while you don't want to physically be a pedo) that you emotionally feel that way, you are putting yourself at risk.  That goes into your record.  And there's a serious risk of the person misunderstanding you & accusing you of saying something you didn't say.

Plus, even if it's not this year, a law could pass any month that makes your state "psychologist" report that to the federal state, police, etc.

Btw, it's not an illness.  The state can define *any* behavior as an illness.  Scientifically it's not.  No behavior is an illness- there's nothing to physically examine.
The ethic and legality of confidentiality apply to all who practice psychotherapy.  Outside of the areas you outlined, none of us are allowed to breach it.
Pedophilic disorder only applies when it causes someone significant mental distress - just worth noting. The DSM-V is pretty shit, though - a lot of people agree on that.

>Considering you have a clean record, deny ever acting on those urges, and you are seeking help, I would assume that is more than enough reason to be protected as a non-offender.

Wrong. MANY therapists can report you, even if you have *no intent to act on anything*. It's a horribly broken system. In the US, that is.
it's a maladaptive behavioral adaptation. I doubt any genes that coded a pedophilia inclination would last long in the gene pool. 

A behavioral adaptation is non genetic evolution, behaviors that are passed down from generation to generation by instruction or demonstration, that were learned to adapt to changing conditions. I learned about it my anthropology class. 

The cycle starts somewhere, the first victim becomes the next offender, hurts someone else, families adapt to cope, and a culture of enablement forms as one generation after the next is hurt. It's a sad story. 
It's likely that it has pedophilia has biological roots. Here's one of many articles about it: http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/jan/20/more-viewing-pedophilia-as-orientation/

If you'd like more information, just ask!
Also if you don't want to say the specific reason, (for scheduling the appointment with a receptionist or something), you can probably just say it's an "abnormal sexual desire" and leave it at that. Leave the details to the professionals and you probably won't run into any problems.
Also, psychiatrist is for meds if you're interested. Therapy can help too! Without insurance, check around for places with a sliding scale or a discount program. My local hospital has a program for people with no insurance!
> They will not call the police. 

In the US that is untrue, unfortunately, even if it does break doctor-patient confidentiality agreements, and even if the patient is at zero risk of offending.
The confidentiality between doctor and patient is legal. You would not be thrown to the wolves unless you were actively abusing children, had committed a murder or were actively planning a suicide.

Good for you for not acting on your impulses, and yes, of course they are most often triggered by being sexually abused as a child.

Please find a therapist and ask for help. There is medical intervention and therapy available.  
You have not hurt yourself or any one else at this point, you cannot be punished or 'turned in' for something you have not done, so please take the next step and find the guidance you need to keep it that way.

I am sorry some one damaged you so. 
As long as they are not planning to hurt themselves or anyone they will not.
[deleted]
This, this, a thousand times this.  Explain your situation and get help.  

This is a HORRIBLE situation, but you can rise above it.  Get help now before you do something you regret.  
Based on many personal experiences that I've heard of, I'm not wrong.
 
In other words, just recently? Most first world countries completely ban it for good reason. Are you in Japan?
There would be no case against them. If they truly have not acted on their thoughts and are seeking help that would be a breach of the very laws that have been made to protect us. I have also sought help for a mental condition and I was not hauled off like an animal.

This is a very silly religion.

I'm stuck in Missouri, starting to believe the only way out is suicide..
Totally agree. Like any difficult issue, there is no silver bullet. However, we do think that getting people to realize it's not something to be ashamed of  and it's something we should talk about is an important first step (no pun intended). Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts - it's all part of the conversation.
my opinion is that there always will be people who will attack what they see as a flaw in someone because of their own insecurities.

i think there are a lot of people, particularly after stigma following these mass shootings, who assume that mentally ill people are incapable of functioning.

I think his journey across Missouri is a great step towards showing people (read: people who are still impressionable) how resilient mentally ill people can be.
walk to another state, it can be done!  i saw it on reddit.
There's an obvious answer.  It's right in front of people, but sadly some people (emotionally) refuse to accept it.      

The stigma exists because the language psychiatrists use. "Mentally ill" is about the most offensive language possible.    It's code for lunatic/insane, & psychiatrists *assume* the person accused has some physical brain defect.   

All of such is 100% wrong.   

Really there's no physical damage, no physical disfunction, no physical diagnosis, etc: 

- “DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, *not any objective laboratory measure.*”    

-- Thomas Insel (Director of the NIMH) @ [psychologytoday.com](http://psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201305/the-nimh-withdraws-support-dsm-5)      

- "Mental disorders don't really live ‘out there’ waiting to be explained. *They are constructs we have made up* - and often not very compelling ones."    

-- [Allen Frances, DSM-IV chief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Frances) in *“DSM in Philosophyland: Curiouser and Curiouser”* in AAP&P Bulletin vol 17, No 2 of 2010   

Basically, there's no "illness."  *There's simply "mental conditions."*   

The phrase "mental condition" (which can mean many things, eg good/bad/temporary etc) is not so hurtful.    

It can include serious suffering, but without *assuming* the person is a brain damaged lunatic. (Like psychiatrists assume.)    


You hit the nail on the head! We seem to only talk about mental illness in the wake of tragedy and in the context of madness as opposed to having a constructive conversation about mental wellness before these terrible tragedies occur. That's easier said than done (to maximuszen's extremely valid point), but talking about it is better than not. And only way we accomplish anything is if it's done collectively.

I fall into deep suicidal ideation unless I masturbate. I was pointing a gun at my face yesterday but I masturbated and then I felt fine.


Not only can you, but I think you need to. Your psychiatrist will help. I guarantee it.
You can, and should. I've not heard of those being tied together before, it's rather interesting imo.
Tell your shrink. Masturbation releases stress relieving hormones into the body. It pushes relaxation and can make one feel better for a time. It's not surprising.

The real issue is that things are so bad you've pointed a loaded gun at yourself, masturbation or not.

Immediately tell your psychiatrist about that and the gun too. You should consider planning on giving your gun to someone else while you're having suicidal ideation. At least keep the gun out of your house. If you don't want to give your gun to someone, you can try to store it at a gun range locker or police station. 
Please get rid of the gun
Yup I also think you should. If nothing else, any link between sex and problems like depression etc are useful for a psychiatrist to know.
It is very important you tell your Therapist, and if possible seek immediate mental health care. Moreover, if you can get checked out by a medical doctor / nurse. 
Yes. In fact, you should tell your psychiatrist. Talk about the suicidal ideation and the suicide attempt as well. 
I'm a therapist and would find this a good thing to bring up. 
Hahahah sorry for laughing..It's not a judging laughter. I think that's a great distraction. Orgasms lower stress levels and they feel great. It's not harmful so you go for it I say! If you want to talk to your psych about it though, go for it. They won't judge you or anything :)
I lie to everyone except my psychiatrist.
Sexual activities as a stress relieving technique, like a compulsion of some sort is pretty common i think... We just don't ask the question enough as psychiatrists
Yup, [having access to a firearm makes one much more likely to commit suicide](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/).  It lets you make impulsive decisions, decisions that you might not otherwise make.
Seconded. 
You're a psychiatrist? I spoke with mine for the first time today and told him about it. He gave me welburtin (just phonetically spelling that). He didn't seem to think the masturbation mattered much 
This is exactly the reason I don't want the people I live with to have guns, but nope! It doesn't matter to them. :/

Respect to the guy, we need more high profile people talking about the subject.
Anyone from the UK here?  Do you think this will actually get something done?
Its awareness, the more high profile people talk the less stigma to mental health it becomes.

I wonder how much I could get them for where I live...

BTW Ketamine is making real strides in help treat depression, it's being called a 'wonder-drug', may be something to consider.
Can it?  Or is it just an escape from reality?
Having listened to the likes of Professor Nutt et al at conferences, is a promising but very early stages of research, and by no means is it likely to lead to a panacea for affective disorders.
"Treat" is a very broad term. Medication rarely ever treats depression, and this article is completely ignoring different states and reasons for depression. 
It can be eye-opening and completely alter someones perspective on themselves and how they fit in the world. You dont need them all the time to escape reality, but instead maybe once or twice a year, or even just a few times in a life. 
I'm on a throwaway because I work for some folks that would fire me if they found out.

It does. They do work. Not always, but they can produce long-term solutions. They did with me. I am not sure I would describe my experience as an escape from reality. I still struggle to describe the experience precisely. The only accurate descriptor I can give to the whole go would be to say it was intense. When I came back down, I realized how fortunate I am to be me and to have the family, friends, and self that I do. It's been over a year now and I still feel grateful.

I'm not saying there aren't days when I am lethargic, but all I need to do is remind myself what I went through on that trip and what I learned and I am out of that down.

I think environment and prior mindset play deciding roles with the experiences individuals have as much as strain and dose.

For what it's worth, I never want to take mushrooms again, but I am damn glad I did.
>medication rarely ever treats depression

Can you explain what you mean by that?
The amount that needs to be taken for beneficial effects also doesn't need to be enough to cause one to be tripping balls.  I was a huge fan of mushrooms when I was younger, and I used to just do them to get fucked up.  In my early twenties, though, I got more serious about life in general and stopped taking recreational drugs all the time. Still, I've taken small amounts of shrooms every now and then... we're talking about half what someone would take to trip. Taking them always resulted in me feeling better than I normally would.  Not because of some high, but rather because I felt as though I understood myself, my actions, and the world around me much better than I did prior to taking them.  As someone in this post mentioned earlier, it makes you grateful for what you have.  Not only that, but I feel that it really helped me gain perspective... I thought about what my parents go through, what my friends go through, etc.  It kept me from only thinking about myself, which no matter what any one tells you, is hard to do.
> Can you explain what you mean by that?

Depression won't go away with medication, its just like taking painkillers when you have a fracture or a broken bone. Its not healed, you're just shutting out the pain. The point of the medication is to make the pain, bearable while going through actual treatment. That will in the best case let you deal with your depression or even get rid of it.
I was tripping balls. Or as someone else said "I want what he's having."
I don't think you're using the correct definition of "treat." "Treat" doesn't mean "cure," it means: *to deal with (a disease, patient, etc.) in order to relieve or cure.* "Relieve" is the target word there, because that is what antidepressants do.

I'm a psychologist who does therapy and not meds, so trust me, I understand where you're coming from. I just see a very anti medication mindset on this sub and I think it's pretty unhealthy.
You'll probably get some hate for your reply but I totally agree.  SSRIs in particular seem like a step backward in treating depression.  Hopefully with better understanding of our brains we can figure out a better solution in the future...
Why was this downvoted?
> I don't think you're using the correct definition of "treat." "Treat" doesn't mean "cure," it means: to deal with (a disease, patient, etc.)

I'm sorry, English isn't my first language, and quite frankly, its a terrible language for discussing treatments and mental health in general.


> "Relieve" is the target word there, because that is what antidepressants do.


Yes, thanks! But I'm talking about how the article itself misuse the term more so than anything.


> I'm a psychologist who does therapy and not meds, so trust me, I understand where you're coming from. I just see a very anti medication mindset on this sub and I think it's pretty unhealthy.

Really? That's funny, because I tend to find it the opposite, often too generous in giving miracle treatments and meds way too much credit like they are actually going to change anything. I work with young adult, psychiatric healthcare and we take a much more critical approach to medication. Because of how different its viewed by the ones working treatment plans etc, compared to, say a doctor, who might just straight up buy everything a patient is telling them. The very notion that a patient can lie to get medication, seem alien and unheard of to a lot of doctors. To me, its something I see weekly. Especially among individuals who see it as a way of controlling a situation when they feel like they've lost control of it.


And I'm not just talking about painkillers or antidepressants, at least here, its so easy to get medication if you just get the chance to speak to a Doctor. And the utter disregard for mixing different kinds of medications is ludicrous, the fact that you don't need to take into account what medications the person is already eating before adding new ones is insane. Young people taking 5-15 pills 2-5 times a day isn't unheard of. And some of these are supposedly doing the same thing, except when one isn't working, instead of taking it out, they just add another.
I frankly don't care. People that don't want to acknowledge scientifically proven methods yet jump onto click baity articles thinking this is a legitimate "cure" is probably suffering from something they need to sort out. Ignorance and denial is the first step to letting your mental issues harm people around you. 


> Hopefully with better understanding of our brains we can figure out a better solution in the future...


It's not really related. Regardless of how good a scientist understand your brain, that won't in any way, shape or form help individuals who are living inside a fantasy bubble and thinks eating mushrooms and smoking weed all day will actually cure them, any more than meditation or religion will. These are tools to help you get onto your feet if you can handle using them as tools and not be reliant of them.



I personally think all substances should be allowed, but I also think that there's a severe lacking in spreading of knowledge about mental health and issues and especially in cases where we're talking about mild cases where they're often not even picked up on. These people usually figure out their life around the age of 26-32 and end up having warped version of reality, extremely prejudice. And have usually lived kind of aggressively, not being able to have any standing relationships whether it be with friends or not, because of how adversary they become naturally by always projecting emotions they never learn to deal with in an internal matter. 


There are so many people who would just need a wake up call, who might not even need medication or therapy, just simple psychological talks and someone professional to reflect upon what they think and let them reflect back. Instead, we give out medication we know might not even help at all, and in cases where the patient is suffering from say, addiction, might be quite harmful. 



**Medication without proper treatment is irresponsible**.
What makes you say they're a step backward?

I'm a psychologist, so I've been surrounded by depressed people for a large portion of my life.  SSRIs save lives.  It's as simple as that.  Do they "cure" depression?  Not even close.  Are they a perfect, or even great, treatment?  No, definitely not.  But they do help, and something that helps even a little bit is going to save lives.

I couldn't even begin to place a number on how many people I've seen who were so depressed that they couldn't even get out of bed to feed themselves or bathe, who, when started on an antidepressant regimen, were able to begin to return to society in such a way that enabled them to engage in therapy and take other therapeutic measures (like eating well, exercising, working on their sleep, socializing, working, engaging in hobbies, etc.).  While it may be these latter measures that are the true "cures" for depression (although I dislike using that word in this context), antidepressants still play a critical role in the treatment of depression.  They're properly used as an "adjunct" treatment along with psychotherapy, and when taken together, the two methods offer far better results than either taken alone.  We know that very clearly, so I'm really not sure how you could say that meds are a step backward.
> There are so many people who would just need a wake up call, who might not even need medication or therapy, just **simple psychological talks and someone professional to reflect upon what they think and let them reflect back.**

As a psychologist, I feel obliged to inform you that that *is* therapy!
> As a psychologist, I feel obliged to inform you that that is therapy!

I know that, I wrote that very late and night and used the wrong term, I was talking about treatment, not therapy.

That's pretty cool. I'd watch it.
nice work
Need more scumbags trying to steal your clothes and convince you to give your meds up. 
I'm sorry but "catatonic" for an hour sounds more like a drama queen.

The whole thing looks awful.
My IQ checks out fine but ever since I have become depressed my brain has slowed down by atleast 80%. It effects me on every level.  I struggle to communicate with my friends because it takes me wayyy to long to process what they said and to articulate an appropriate response. My writing speed has dropped considerably. Anyone else on the same boat as me? How has depression effected you?

It's more like I just can't be bothered with most intellectual challenge anymore. Anything that requires me to be really present and focused is likely to not feel worth it. 
I've been told I'm "slow" and "retarded" before and it absolutely devastates me. I know I am an intelligent and capable human being, but being depressed doesn't reflect that. I have bipolar disorder and certain people (mostly people from high school) in my life have only seen the depressed side of me and just assume that I am slow, but I have found that I can be more thoughtful than most people I know. This has been a real insecurity for me and often cripples me from putting myself out there, but it is nice to know that other people feel this way. Thank you OP for having the courage to say this
It's a pretty common symptom of depression. In a way it seems natural. When someone is depressed, he won't be the smartest guy in the room because his mind is occupied with his emotional load.
Innumerable times. But after I have started noticing it, I started to make concerted efforts in gathering my thoughts. I also focused on one small thing at a time. More importantly, I decide to take a long, deep breath and give myself some time out by keeping quiet and not exerting myself too much. I like to think I am getting recharged for the next thing. These strategies have helped me somewhat.
I felt the same way after starting medication, it made me feel even worse and I began to isolate myself because I was so self conscious. I discontinued the meds and I've slowly begun to feel like my old self again. I feel the antidepressants were a major setback in my recovery. I wish I had put forth more of an effort with living a healthy lifestyle (diet and exercise) before taking the medication route.  
Yes. I have a very high iq, and am normally very high functioning. But when I am at my lowest, I am unable to process thoughts, I am unable to read, I cannot focus on conversation, and I cease to be able to function like a normal human being.
Mine actually has dropped.  It's better now than it was on any medication, but it sucks to find out that all my suspicions about getting dumber and dumber turned out to be correct.

Not so simple. Some people are getting help and still experience symptoms. Some people would consider the side effects of my bipolar related depression & anxiety as negative but i actively see two doctors to deal with them.

I hate it when people treat MY mental illness as an inconvenience on THEIR lives. That is really unacceptable and i would rather be alone than judged by someone like that. I deal with this everyday, they don't.
Maybe this is why I'm alone, thanks!
You know what? I never thought of that. 

Quick, younger me, don't reward mom being manipulative. Also, mom, why did you let grandpa get drunk and smack you around? You just reinforced his negative behavior.

/sarcasm
As others have pointed out, this quote comes off as victim-blaming to survivors/victims of domestic abuse or mental illnesses.  It does take an average of 7 times for a victim to leave their abuser. 

At the same time this quote can be encouraging to those in unhealthy relationships/friendships to use "tough love" .  Breaking off unhealthy relationships is part of growing up and may take longer for some.  I've been too nice and had to put my foot down  with my best friend. I told him I couldn't be friends with him unless he went to therapy because I felt like I was in an abusive relationship with him. It was a win-win because he finally went to therapy after avoiding dealing with depression, childhood trauma, and a break-up. 

Good advice OP. People will stay the same in relationships/friendships and will only change in therapy.
That is a tough war to fight with some of my family members
so alone


he looks so much like my mom's dog- the same dopey silly expression even. he looks so friendly and goofy.
Thread originally Started by user u/mudblood0089 :) 
He is such a crazy dog, but is extremely loving and caring. He wants to be everyone's best friend, and he is my best friend. :) 
He is goofy, in his own weird way. He can open doors, jump insane heights and etc. I love him so much :) and If ur pup looks like max then he's very handsome ;)

I can absolutely relate.
I was told this would be a good thing to share with others who have depression because it depicts how it can feel sometimes.  
> As if you woke up on the wrong side of reality and stepped into it backwards.

Yup.
Really enjoyed this (Unfortunately). 
Yep! I often focus on trying to act normal.
These are dark times, and I really want to hug someone, so here is my virtual hug to all of you.  I've been reading articles about how there have been multiple post-election suicides of trans youths, and that there have been significant increases in suicide hotline calls..
.A few hours ago I was standing and pacing on a bridge I've secretly planned on jumping off of.  I climbed over the railing and sat on the edge for a while, terrified.  I changed my mind, for you all.  I think my desperation can be channeled into empathy.   And I just want to say I relate to so many of these posts and I wish we could all hang out and take comfort in each other.  The world needs sensitive people like us to counteract the hatred.
I'm glad you didn't jump.
This too, shall pass.
I'm also glad you didn't jump... thank you for coming here and sharing this with us and thank you for your empathy. I'm really glad that you were able to find strength in that moment and I hope you can continue being strong. I'll definitely remember your story. 
Thanks for making the choice to live. Big hugs, right back at you. 
There are a lot of bad people in this world, please do not commit suicide over this - that is exactly what trump supporters want as you can see by their comments all over the internet. Democracy isn't a perfect system, but it is not completely broken, but republicans are horrible people and only care about making the 1% more rich while destroying the low and middle class, and throwing the blame at democrats. 

Trump won because he went after the uneducated masses and used fear mongering and false hopes to draw them (hence why so many conservative Christians vote republican without even thinking twice) - The best thing we can do is go to the 2018 midterms and vote democrat and that will give us a chance to have checks and balances against trump and to have a good president in 2020. Until then just avoid all the BS you read and see online, don't get involved in pointless debates with people who may not even live in this country. Most of it is just from 12 year old trolls, take your anger to the voting booth in the midterms! Republicans always have a stronger turnout in the midterms from the older generation, it is time for the rest of us to stand up for what's right. 
Just got to get through another day. thank you.
thank you.  peace.
thank you.  I appreciate you all taking the time to express these kind words.
hugs hugs. thank you.
right on!!absolutely true. we have to stand strong. thank you.
A little kindness goes a long way, I find. :) And I definitely meant every word of it. 
Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this question, but I've been talking to my girlfriend all morning trying to calm her down. She's currently at work and can barely hold herself together because she's so emotional. She has been vehemently apposed to Trump's election and after last night she just lost it.

She has been sexually and emotionally abused in her past and in her words she "...can barely keep from crying. I have a fear of even being alone in a room with older men.Watching over half the country put someone in office that I'd be scared to death to be in a room with threw me over the edge." 

I don't know what to do to help her as I fear she'll put her job in jeopardy. I've already tried to get her to just go home. I know she needs therapy, but hasn't yet. I need advice on how to handle this current situation.
Encourage her to cut herself off from the web, Facebook and all social media, TV for starters.  Even emotionally healthy people are having a hard time enduring all the coverage.  It's just going to fuel her anxiety.
This is how I look at it (not saying this is the way it is, so please don't get offended. It's just my point of view.)

The core of hate and short-thinking is fear. People want easy solutions for complex problems because they feel incapable of dealing with them. Some are irrational, some are just not capable of thinking things through. When I see some angry Trump supporter, I don't see rage but fear, sadness and despair. When I see a old man supporting misanthropic ideas I don't see self-righteousness but the incapability of seeing beyond the way they were raised. It's a sad story rather than one that's horrifying and I think that it's more about learning from all this. 

Your girlfriend is apparently stronger than most other people in that sense. That's both a burden and a opportunity.

I had a conversation with someone who was really upset about the things Trump said about women. I believe that most people that are willing to do such things are incredibly insecure. They are pathetic - or pitiful. It's a bit hard to explain, but try to not see them as predators but just as pathetic human beings. I think that taking pity on people like that is a better way than being afraid or angry. 

I don't know. Maybe someone gets something from my perspective, maybe not. 
It makes a lot of sense why she is feeling the way she is, really.   
It would be very retraumatizing to...say you got robbed, someone violated the safety of your home...then the leader of the robbers was elected chairman of your homeowners association. That would fuck with you.  

Therapy for sure would be a great support. It is for me.  
Fact is, she is doing the best she knows how to cope & I'm impressed that she even tried going to work. She is very brave.  She is right, this goon is scary. He's a fucking nightmare.
My advice is to encourage finding a therapist to ally herself with. Do *not* tell her to "suck it up" because she's doing the best she can already. Maybe she could take a long weekend or some time off. Let her know that she has more ppl than she realizes on her side & that these fools are not taking over the world-without a fight. 
Don't know about her specific situation but what helps me is to know that what's ultimately happening is that we are opening our eyes to reality. An ugly reality, but we now have valuable knowledge that we might not have had otherwise and now we can use it for the better. If we never got the chance to know that half our voting nation is ok with a President saying incredibly prejudiced things proudly and unapolgeticly then who knows what could invisibly fester and grow unchecked. If I had friends say the things he's said, I would confront them directly because if they fail to see how its upsetting to me and fail to desire to rethink their preconceived notions then I couldn't see myself remaining friends with them. In fact, I _have_ confronted friends over a different type of prejudice (and it sunk in, they later said that that was the only time they'd ever seen me get angry). Point is that we now have no choice but to face the fact that something is really wrong. And facing it is the first step to being able to change it and to heal our country. This is a good thing wrapped in a gift-wrapping of shit but still a good thing regardless. We might indeed have some nasty years in our future, but that suffering will help us prevent something worse.
Her problem existed before the election. If she doesn't seek help, her problem will continue after the election...

It's probably pretty silly of me posting this, but idk, I find it so amazingly calming. I'm not someone terribly concerned about the result, but Obama's demeanor in this address is just so calm and collected -- it's like my father telling me that everything is okay. I know your girlfriend isn't some little kid -- I just wanted to share this for those who hadn't seen it.
Beware of many of  the people here, who are essentially ads.  

ie:

- *they don't tell you what could help her for free.*

- *they alleged they could, if you paid them money.*

I believe most of them work as various therapists and "mental health" profiteers and they all tell you to seek alleged "help"- paying them shocking amounts of money.

Anyways, the best thing might be taking a few days off.  Or realizing both candidates were corporate slimeballs.  I don't know how someone couldn't see that.


Honestly, without therapy, I don't see things really changing for her.  Of course I'm not saying it's impossible, but it really sounds like she needs to learn how to rewire her brain.  I'm certainly not criticizing her, I'm the same way, but therapy has really helped me.  I'm certainly not qualified to diagnose anyone, and I don't even know anything other than what you're written, but I'd suggest looking into the possibility of her having PTSD from the past traumas she's gone through.

As for how to help her if she's totally against therapy, DBT skills could possibly be a huge help to her.  If you Google Dialectical  Behavioral Therapy, you should find tons of info about it.  It's not your job to fix things for her but since you're asking for advice, maybe you could subtly help her learn some of those skills and see how it goes.  Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want to talk more about it.  I wish both of you luck!  It may get worse before it gets better, but dealing with tough emotions can definitely lead to a higher quality of life in the end.  For me it had definitely been worth it!
Well you're already being very supportive, and not mocking her for crying, so you're ahead of my husband.

Therapy has been the only thing keeping me from completely giving up.  I'm on the ground.  I'm tired.  I'm hopeless.  But I'm hanging on because I can count on her to hear me, believe me, and coach me through.  It is scary and hard to find a good therapist but it is worth it when you do find a good one.  Offer to help her find the right one, and continue to be supportive.


I was worried this was a troll, but I can tell now it's not.  It is 100% the right place for this.  I'm not a professional or anything, but it did just happen, so it'll probably subside over time.  If you can talk her into therapy without risk of getting slapped or raged at I definitely would.  I've been through a ridiculous amount of therapy and only took away a very small amount, but that small amount is what helps me get through the day and keep me sane.
Maybe if you explain that presidents are largely figure heads under the influence of big banks and industry and as such not much will change (which is a shame actually) then that might help? In north america things will likely just keep on truckin as is.

But ya actually getting help sounds like the best option. Good luck.

Her issues have nothing to do with Donald Trump. Is she in therapy?
She sounds a little manic. Perhaps get her to take a sick/personal day and organise her something relaxing to do without it tv access, preferably with you. If you feel that this sort of thing is becoming a major issue and it lasts more than a week try asking her to see someone. If she isn't manic the panic should settle soon because the level energy required to maintain it can't keep up forever.

Once she has settled and you've given it a bit perhaps research we are you two just she CA an act in the local community to help support some if her political ideals (eg working in soup kitchens) to help her feel more in control and positive.
I'm trying my best to be supportive. Part of me wants to tell her to suck it up and do her job, but I know that would on exacerbate the situation. Supportive boyfriend. Supportive boyfriend. 
As a woman and a fellow sexual assault and emotional abuse survivor, it would cause MAJOR damage if you told someone who is frightened of another due to their assault to "suck it up".  It would behoove you to be her protector right now.  I know you want to "do something" to make this better, but one of the best things to do is to just listen to her. Let her cry it out. Let her come to grips with who the country chose.  Like me right now, she probably feels threatened. I have today off and right now I'm laying in bed in the middle of the afternoon crying. I feel like the assaulters all across the United States won, as if to say "grabbing her by the pussy" is ok. And my husband will get home from work today and he will just sit and hold me as I cry this out because he knows I just have to let the emotions come through.  Continue to encourage her to take time off from work if she needs it, and maybe have her take a break from news organizations and Facebook and things like that. I will probably need to do the same.  I wish you both well.  Hug her extra tight today.
Yeah, you gotta strike a balance, and be sensitive to the fact that this was a legitimately traumatic event for a lot of people.  Considering the nature of the campaigns, it's not quite your average election.
I talked her into going and getting a journal to write in, but she is also going to post everything she writes to Facebook for everyone to see. I don't think that's a good idea and told her this is therapeutic and not to soapbox with FB. She responded saying "I'll try not to embarrass you", FML...
How she handles this is her choice. Whoever abused her already took control of her life away from her. Right now you are doing the same thing by telling her off when she decides to post about her feelings.

You wanna tell her to suck it up and you accuse her of using Facebook as a soapbox when she reaches out for support elsewhere. No wonder she has to look elsewhere considering how you treat her.
Wall of text inbound but I think it's worth reading

I'm 20 and was diagnosed with anxiety this summer. All of a sudden I was getting constant panic attacks and was anxious to do anything. There was probably some depression too that I didn't pick up on. I was put on 10mg of Lexapro and .5mg Ativan. The Lexapro worked for about a month and a half but then I was getting panic attacks again and was taking Ativan daily. My doc increased it to 15mg and then hell broke loose. 3 days later boom severe depression and suicidal thoughts out of no where, had my worst panic attack ever on the way to work and it was filled with suicidal thoughts. Ativan stopped it but I was shaking and sweating for a while after. 

Went to the doctors and he gave me a prescription for 100mg of Zoloft, apparently 100mg of Zoloft equaled 15mg of Lexapro so I could make the switch immediately. It has been 4 days since I started Zoloft and it's been hell, a mixture of the Lexapro still in me and the new medication I assume. I don't want to do anything, just sleep all day. The worst symptom has been a constant thought of quitting work. I love my job and just got a promotion to temp manager, but my mind says to stop going. 

This morning was awful, I was very depressed and dreaded work. I was literally about to call my boss and say I wasn't coming in but I knew if I didn't go today I would just be in panic about my next shift and thus the cycle would continue. I said fuck this, took an Ativan, and went. Damn am I glad I did because it wasn't even bad. I had nice conversations with my co workers and customers, felt pretty good, did have some low points but that was because I hadn't eaten in a while. Toward the end of my shift I had to be the only manager there for an hour while the real manager went on break, and I was terrified, but I did awesome and held down the fort, with zero anxiety. 8 hours later (also my longest shift in months) and the day was done.

The thing I dreaded most is over and I fucking won. Now I have a day off tomorrow, a therapy appointment on monday, and a doctors appointment on tuesday then work that night. Hopefully once the time has come for that shift I will have reassurance from my support network and have my toolbox full of coping mechanisms for the shift that night, knowing if I could do it tonight I sure as hell can do it again. I awarded myself with a nice cigar, some music, and tea with my pops on the porch. 

That's my story. Fuck anxiety, fuck depression, and fuck SSRI side effects, but dammit this is my life and they can't have it. Hope you all find motivation or something from this, and I'm here to talk if you need it. Stay strong 
With depression every win is worth celebrating
Listen to me. Ask your doc to run a thyroid test (it's a blood test) on you. You need to rule out and organic reason for your misery. Also have your doc look at your Vitamin D level. 
Already did that it came back normal and I've been taking vitamin D supplements daily for 2 weeks

As a psychotherapist who has seen a great deal of depression, especially in sexual assault trauma, it's great when a role model and celebrity step forward to ease the stigma.
Hi ChildTherapist, 

Thanks so much for the comment and the work you do. I agree! It's refreshing to see those in the public eye being open about their personal struggles. It gives me hope that there will be less and less stigma around depression and other mental health issues as time goes on. :)
That is a lot of the work I do around the country.  Reducing stigma and shame goes a long way to getting people the help they need.

wow, this is a great video.

maybe some day I can learn how to human, too.

–––––––––––

In January 2012, I met a woman who inspired me, and as I learned later, many others, to truly dream bigger and actually make those dreams happen.  For three years, we accomplished so much together -- starting a business, traveling the world, sneaking backstage at music festivals despite being in our 30s -- despite the fact that she suffered from serious depression, which, looking back, was getting worse as time passed.

Andrea took her own life last week.  She was 38 years old.

If you saw her funeral, her Facebook, or the celebration of her life that we held for her, you would have seen that she was incredibly loved by a number of people that was shockingly large, even knowing her as well as I did.  She had at least 150 people come to both her funeral and celebration, and close to 300 people post on her Facebook wall about how they will miss her.  But, when you're depressed, you don't see that.  You see yourself as a burden.  You feel guilty for being you.  You feel that no one could possibly love you.  You feel that your life is one big fuck up, and will continue to be one big fuck up.  Does this match any of your experiences?

During the funeral, there were a few people present who were surprisingly upset considering that they didn't know Andrea all that well, and each of those people ended up telling me that they, too, suffer from depression, and that it could just have easily been them in that casket.  I pointed out to them that Andrea could have called anyone in that room when she needed to talk, but didn't, because when it was bad she didn't want to burden them, and when it was *really* bad she was physically unable to.

I think it served as a huge wake-up call to them that it's time to seek treatment now, even though treatment is difficult and far from certain.  And, I hope to extend that wake-up call to those on Reddit with depression.  If you're imminently considering harming yourself, you may feel like Andrea did... that you're just a fuck up, that you're alone, that nobody wants to be around you... but it's almost a certainty that you're just as wrong as Andrea was.  If you really try, can you think of just one time that you felt loved?  That someone did something that showed that they cared about you?  Can you accept that there may be many more of these times, and that there will probably be more in the future, but your depression is hiding these times from you right now?  Please pause reading this post until you've actually given it a try.

If you're maybe a few steps back from imminently considering harming yourself, know that I learned a few days ago while cleaning out her room that Andrea decided to stop taking her medicine about 10 days before she passed.  She didn't tell this to anyone of which I'm aware. Maybe she thought she was feeling better and didn't need it. Maybe she got tired of a side effect. I don't know, but it may have been the mistake that cost us this amazing human being.  There is no bigger priority in *your* life than getting and maintaining treatment.  If you're getting therapy and taking medicine, do what it takes to make sure you continue.  If you're down to your last pill or realize you forgot to take one, there is nothing -- not a job, not a bill, not an event -- more important than fixing that situation.  Make it your personal rule that if this happens, you drop *everyting* until you've made it better.  If you're not getting therapy and (if appropriate) taking medicine, then that is your priority.

If you need help finding a therapist or affording a therapist, let me know and I will try to help you.  I don't know you, but I feel for you, and I'm writing here now because if I can find any comfort in her death, it will be that someone else will live and get better as a result.  Will you be that person?


PS - In case this doesn't hit close enough to home, Andrea was a Redditor.  She loved sci-fi, travel, and /r/ladybonersgw. ;)  Her last post was on an anti-anti-vaxxer thread, a cause in which she had no patience for stupidity.  RIP, /u/moneta_xi
What you've posted about her is really kind. It's clear that you loved her very deeply. I'm sorry to hear about all of this.

I dealt with the suicide of a friend five years ago. It was really hard one me. I realize that when you're in a relationship with someone the connection is overwhelming. You are connected in every way. You are connected physically and spiritually and emotionally.

Thank you for showing her so much love. It's not always easy to love someone in situations like that. Thank you for using that love and spreading it around and trying to reach out to others who could be in her situation or your situation. 

My thoughts are with you. Keep your head up.

I'm very sorry about the loss of your girlfriend. I hope that in time you will be okay.

I suffer from bad depression and anxiety (that gets in the way of me getting help sometimes) and I feel the way you described a lot. I feel like this could easily have been written about me, and I often think about how my boyfriend would feel if I killed myself.

Thanks for giving me some perspective on things. I hope that I can overcome myself and make it.
I'm so sorry. 
That was a beautiful post in her memory and I hope it helps anyone going through a bad time. I'm very sorry for your loss. It is ridiculous that your post was removed from the other subreddits you posted it to. 

Stay productive and kind, I hope in time you'll feel ok :) the advice you gave at the funeral was touching.
Really sorry for your loss but two things stand out in your post:

- The comment on how many people attended her funeral
- The comment of how many Facebook messages she got on her page.

People care, when it's too late. I struggle with depression, Ive made some attempts of my own life. I will always remember coming too and a paramedic giving me real talk and advice.

This stranger cared more about me than these so called Facebook friends, and went above and beyond his job role.

You cannot teach compassion and you can't teach people to care. In my experience, most people don't. 

My "friends" mourn the loss of a celeb to suicide...completely oblivious that their facebook friend nearly went the same way. If I were to tell them, trust me, they would judge and wouldn't be interested. How do I know? Because they were crappy friends in the first place. I hate being so cynical but it's the truth.

For some, depression is something that they just can't escape - they can seemingly have everything one needs to be happy and still be unhappy. For others, like myself, they don't have much to live for. Lost all their friends. Sh*t job. No relationship, or constant bad ones. Dysfunctional family. For people like us, how many people write on our Facebook if we were to pass is irrelevant. 
> But, when you're depressed, you don't see that. You see yourself as a burden. You feel guilty for being you. You feel that no one could possibly love you. You feel that your life is one big fuck up, and will continue to be one big fuck up.

Wow that hits close to home. The continuing to be a fuck up was what forced me into getting help because I felt like to much of a burden on my family, friends, and co-workers. I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you :)
Happy to talk when you're ready.
I hope you can overcome it too. :)  As the boyfriend, I can tell you that there has been nothing that even comes close to comparing to this in my life.  It is the single most devastating thing to have ever happened to me.

I know that a lot of people say they would have killed themselves if it wasn't for thinking of their family and friends.  But, I do want you to know that in Andrea's last few seconds, she wasn't able to think about how people would feel if she died.  She wasn't even in control of her own body anymore.  She was on an auto-pilot mission to end the pain.

What I'm trying to say is: use the leverage that you give yourself in thinking about how destroyed people would be if they were to lose you in order to do what it takes to prevent you from getting even close to your breaking point.  In other words, Andrea needed to be reminded of how much people cared about her not when she was seconds from dead, but when she decided to stop taking her medicine.

*hugs*
Thank you.  Will stay productive because, well, that's what I do.
A lot of depressed people see their friends not giving them the support that they feel they need and assume that it's because *no one cares*.  In reality, I think there are many more potential explanations:

1) They don't understand depression at all

2) They don't understand how serious your depression is

3) Depression reminds them of their own internal struggles and they try to block it out

4) Life is hard, man, and if you're working, raising kids, trying to get into that Ph.D program, etc., it's easy to forget or to not have time

Is it possible your friends just don't give a fuck about you?  I guess.  But, I think it's far more likely that they're not thinking, "Whatever, don't really care about Lubz3, s/he can go kill him/herself," but instead something closer to the ideas I posted above.  And, I want to point out that it's not *you* that has trouble with getting friends to hang out and talk.  It's *everyone*.  I'm not depressed, and I have friends who love me, but sometimes... sometimes you message them all and it's like, "What the fuck?  Where is everyone?"  Life isn't like the TV show Friends, where everyone has groups of 6 that have no trouble seeing each other all the time.  I've known my best friend for 27 years and we live 5 miles from each other, but still can go weeks without hanging out.  I know it's not that he doesn't care, but that we're just busy people.
Glad you've been motivated to get help.  If at any point you feel like a burden again, know this: I would give *anything* to have her "burden me" right now.  I miss every stupid thing she'd complain about, every phone call asking me to reassure her for an hour that something trivial was fine, and every opportunity I had to hold her and tell her it would be ok.
*hugs!*

Thank you so much. I am very much one of the people that feel as though they're living for their family and friends, and I do have moments where I'm blind to pretty much everything, and I feel I could have a momentary lapse. I am starting meds and trying to get help so hopefully there's hope for me.

I really am so sorry you had to go through that. I can't imagine how you're feeling or what questions are going through your mind. Just know that as someone who has felt like she felt, it was not your fault, and I'm sure you did everything you could. Sometimes there is nothing anyone can do. Sometimes it gives us tunnel vision and there's no helping us. It's hard. I don't ever want to put my boyfriend or my family/friends through that, although I feel all the time that I'm burdening them with my neediness and emotions. I know how hard it is for everyone to be around me, especially if I don't even like being around myself. 

I'm glad my boyfriend is there for me, I will try to remember what you said about how you're feeling the next time I think he hates me cause I'm crazy and my emotions are stressing him out.

I'm sure she knew you all loved her very much, and I'm sorry that she was so sad that she couldn't see the beauty surrounding her. I know you're going to feel sad for a while but I hope that you feel better soon.
No, I completely understand that. Im not talking weeks of not seeing each other, Im talking months... with my friends it was a case of too busy to hang out...but then they run around the country making last minute plans to see guys they've never met.

I was in a relationship but I still made time for my friends, because I feel it's good to have a healthy balance. But my friends were so damn unreliable, or only met up when they wanted my help with something or they were trying to make up numbers, my boyfriend at the time ended up being the only person I had to hang out with. That relationship, unsurprisingly, too deteriorated.

I think my personal experience was just bad luck - Ive moved back to my hometown and things are a lot better, Ive met new people but I keep things a little more casual now. 

I totally understand that people have busy lives, they get into relationships, or they have their own crap going on. Im busy too and I don't expect to hang out with people every week. But it seems a lot of people prefer digital friendships/relationships these days and that just isn't me. 
It's also possible that your friends suck.  In which case, as difficult as it may seem at first, making new friends might be useful.  It seems that you're already working on that, which is awesome.  Have you tried meetup.com or similar things in your area?  I'm also into music and have found that it's easy to make friends in the music scene for most genres.
Yeah Ive now taken steps to make new friends instead of putting time and effort in with people  who were draining. Tried meetup, been a bit hit and miss as it sometimes feels a bit like speeddating, but Ive met some nice people and checked out some cool places. 

Your initial reply was great in understanding why sometimes those closest to us aren't around when you need them. It can be very frustrating sometimes and a major contributor to depression.

Also, I really am sorry for your loss, You seem like a great guy and someone your girlfriend could rely on for support. 
Awesome... yeah Meetup is hit or miss, but so is pretty much every variety of finding new friends.  One of the problems with making new friends is: not everyone is going to like you (and, likewise, you will not like everyone).  There's a ton of "rejection," and you just have to frame it as, "If I talk to 50 people and I make 2 new friends, I just made 2 new friends!!!" instead of "I can't believe 96% of people don't want to be friends with me."  Because the thing that matters is not your "success percentage," but that you made friends.

As a guy, we have to deal with this all the time in the world of dating.  If we assume for a sec that "better" women (prettier, smarter, more fun, *etc*.) are more difficult to attract than less desirable partners, I might have a choice between approaching a few less desirable partners before one agrees to a date, or approaching a few *hundred* amazing women before one agrees to a date.  Who's the winner: the guy with the higher percentage who got a less desirable partner, or the guy who got rejected a couple hundred times but was rewarded with awesome?
Ahh yes I see, I do sometimes forget how difficult it must be for guys to approach women, being rejected is never nice. From what Ive seen at the Meetups though, the women there are pretty game and are kinda there to meet guys too, often pursuing a guy. 

Theres nothing wrong with seeing the potential of meetup to meet someone romantically, but at the moment Im not looking for a relationship, Im more looking for friends and some of the women aren't really there to make new friends. And at the risk of sounding bigheaded, Ive never had much luck making guy mates as they do tend to make a pass at me.

Nevertheless, like anything in life, you never know until you give it a go and as long as youre motivated to put yourself out there there's always an opportunity to meet new people that you click with, both romantic and platonic :)


This story made me cry, I feel for you
[More detail on the incident and history of his illness](http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/08/joel-reuters-family-pushes-for-change-in-mental-illness-laws/)
This is very sad. We lost one of the best of us it seems. It's obvious the love he generated in everything written about him. It's good to honor his memory.

It's also good to bring attention to what was obviously a ridiculously inadequate response on the part of the medical professionals involved. So many are over-specialized they ignore potentially devastating drug interactions or other side-effects that arise not just in one part of the body or brain but when the various parts work together.  I hope some doctors will think hard about what might have been the exact cause of this tragic loss. thanks for sharing. Even without having known him, it was worthwhile. Well done. 
I've been unemployed for two years now. I have a shaky track record when it comes to working (because of mental illness & physical illness) and where I live there is high unemployment (17%). I'm not dealing with it very well, I tried going back to study but don't have the money to do so and have no way of getting it unless i can find work. I'm feeling myself becoming more and more hopeless and am not really sure what to do anymore. 
Establish a daily routine that will keep you disciplined while you wait for work. This should include some sort of exercise regimen (even if it's going for a long walk), eating healthy and making a list of home chores to be completed that day. Just the way you get up and go to work when you have a job, you should also have a daily regimen for when you're *not* working. Look around in your town for easy work like bussing tables or handing out fliers. The lightest work will still give you a sense of purpose.
The only way I was able to find a job was to heal myself first. And looking for a job was a way to help me heal. I hope that helps, that's all I can tell yoU. 
I'm with u/Offthepoint and u/Ilovebookssomuch4444. Establishing a routine will make you disciplined. Also, finding a simple work with little income will (in addition to feeling purposeful) help you make some money so you can afford your study costs. Maybe after earning a good amount you can start a small business, raise the profit and get over the unemployment thing.

All what you need is patience. I wish you the best.
Hey Man, I'm the same but been unemployed for a year. I had a good career and it all had to end because of mental illness. And idk about you but it's like the unemployment makes my mental health worse, but I'm too mentally ill to work...it's a cycle :/

I'm slowly starting to accept my career may not be what I want it to be and I need to stop focussing on returning to work with the subsequent disappointment. I don't struggle getting job interviews but I never attend because I'm too unwell anyway. Not sure why I bother. Pressuring myself I guess.

I know it's hard because like one of the replies here has said, you need to focus on getting better but you get to a point where you get sick of hearing people say that. My family have been saying it for a year and I don't understand how to "focus" on it, and how long to. It's ridiculous.

It's a hard situation and I get it. :(
I don't know which country you live in (17% unemployment?!), but I've found it incredibly useful to contact vocational rehabilitation. They connected me with an employment specialist who specializes in helping people with mental illnesses get and keep jobs. Before this I couldn't bear to even look at my resumé, didn't have a cover letter, hadn't practiced mock interviews, didn't have references, was too anxious and disordered to call back the few times I got contacted by recruiters, and rarely ever applied to jobs. Now I meet with her almost weekly for over an hour to apply for jobs. I let her know when I get a call back, because otherwise I get paralyzed by anxiety and miss my opportunity. This year things are starting to look up. 


Its normal to feel overwhelmed and hopeless, because the effort needed to get a job for someone suffering from a chronic illness requires more effort than one person can give. It just means you need people to support you. If you don't have voc rehab where you live then try to find someone else who can help you, such as a career center, therapist, or family member.
I do volunteering at an old folks home. It gives me a sense of purpose but it doesn't have the same pressures of a paid job. It's no biggie if I take a few sick days. 
Go on disability, I know I would. 
I haven't had a job in a year and a half. I went to see a vocational person at my mental health team but she didn't think I was ready to look for work. Things are only getting worse. I'm not sure how it's ever going to get better.
I'm much better than i was a year ago. I eat cleanly and do an hour or two of exercise a week which is all i can manage because of having chronic fatigue. I'm going to try to keep a stricter routine though, there are days where i let it slip and dont medicate which means i sleep 14 - 16 hours a day. You cant get much done when you sleep most of the day away lol.
Thankyou. I'm going to try to invest all i can into recovery. It's only the hope you can have. 
YES ! Getting a minimum wage job can be awesome. It can give you plenty of energy while staying at home all day can make you lethargic. 
I'm not looking for anything flash for work. Literally just minimum wag, problem is I have chornic fatigue so I can't do anything strenuous. I have tried but after working for a week part time in a cafe, fainting taking plates of food with me .. I've determined i'm not up for that just yet. So it does limit my pool. 

I think have too many little things getting in the way and should probably concentrate on that before i get too hung up on a career. But I also can't afford to get treatments that i need so its a cycle. 
You mentioned not attending job interviews, I have a similar problem of getting overwhelmed with anxiety when I get a call back and so I don't call them back. I wish I had contacted vocational rehab sooner instead only last year, because the employment specialist I have through them has been very valuable. Since working with her on a weekly basis I've returned calls about jobs within days instead of never. She also scheduled mock interviews for me, you may find that useful too.


Your family are obviously not experienced mental health and employment professionals who have a history of successfully helping people with a chronic mental illness get their lives back, so its not surprising that their advice is useless. If you want advice thats actually helpful you will have to meet with someone else, such as voc rehab or a therapist.
Oh man i lost my career because of mental illness too. It takes a huge toll on your mental health to suddenly be unemployed and virtually unemployable because of something beyond your control. 

Man i wish i could get an interview. My experience is so niche and only works in the field i was in that people laugh at me when i apply for even minimum wage jobs. But even if you where to go to those interviews and get a job.. keeping it is a whole 'nother ball game.
I'm registered with an employment service center but honestly it hasn't helped in the slightest. There's little to no work here (I live in a rural area in a country with high youth unemployment). And my previous experience is no help whatsoever It's really niche, people literally laugh at me when i apply for minimum wage because of it. I'm way over qualified but i also can't return to my previous industry so its a catch. 

I dont have any issue in interviews luckily. It's even getting one thats proving difficult. In two years with 20+ applications a month I've only had one interview. 

I think it doesnt helpd that i dont have family and because of an extended period of depression i dont really have my friendship group anymore either. I probably need to concentrate on therapy.
I applied for a bunch of volunteer positions and besides being shocked that they interview as if it where a regular paid job.. i was knocked back from all of them. That peaked my desperation tbh.
Oh man its so hard to get here though. There are cases in my country of people with terminal cancer, missing limbs etc being rejected repeatedly. Mental illnesses are an automatic rejection regardless of severity here unfortunately. 
I feel the same way. It's a cycle. I hope you have a good support system to help you through and keep working on yourself, keep fighting to get better, It's all you can do. As long as you keep fighting you're doing the right thing.
I know how you feel so I really hope it gets better for you <3
I understand. Would a part-time job work for you?
Its scary to consider moving, especially when you're already stressed due to an illness, but have you applied for jobs in an area that doesn't have such a ridiculously high unemployment rate? You don't have to accept the job if you ultimately can't find a way to move, but just getting call-backs and interviews might help you feel like you do have some control over your life. And once you get a job offer you may find the pieces falling into place to allow you to relocate even if it means living without furniture for a while. And if that doesn't happen, you can turn the job offer down and your life won't have changed for the worse.


My fears for moving away are that I'm afraid I will struggle to rebuild the support network I depend on here: therapist, psychiatrist, employment specialist, autism specialist, and I live with my parents so I don't need to worry about rent or food. But I try to remind myself that a different city would still offer most of the above along with things I don't have here: friends and acceptable public transportation.
Where are you from? I'm in Australia and I've done a few volunteer things and none of them have been like that! Sounds infuriating 
That's really fucked up I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Gives me perspective 
Thats what im aiming for. I just wish someone would give me a chance. I want to write off my experience because its in a niche industry and its holding me back from getting work (people see it as a really glamerous industry and automatically go "why is she applying here? she should work in that industry - she's overqualified") But if i write it off i have a blank resume. I wish i could return to my industry but its not a possibility for many different reasons. Hopefully i can find something even volunteer for a while so my resume isnt so sad haha
I did move a few years back and I deteriorated very fast. I attempted suicide a few times and was hospitalised often, leading to me ultimately loosing my job. I found being isolated from my partner and friends at the time to be much worse for me and honestly there's little imporovement in job prospects. The unemployment rate only marginally improves to 15.7% in the large city where I lived.
I realise that I'm sounding a bit like I don't want solutions which is not the case. Any advice does really help. I have just found that I've exhausted things that have been suggested to me and that it feels like a dead end because of this.
Its perfectly normal to seem like you're eliminating solutions, depression wires us to focus on the negatives. Its likely that many of the things you tried actually helped to a small extent, although perhaps not enough to justify the effort you had to put in. If you had less severe depression the things you tried might have helped more noticeably, and you might have been able to use them as stepping stones to recovery. 


So the question is: what things helped you even if to a small extent, and who is supporting you now and could help you help yourself. For example, I notice that I feel better when my workspace is clean and organized but I rarely ever have the energy to clean up and when I do sometimes it means I have less energy left over for something else. So about once a month I ask my mom to help me clean up together, so that we can get twice as much done and so I don't get discouraged early on and stop or procrastinate. What things make you feel better (not "supposed to" be healthy and make you feel better, but things you know from experience actually make you feel better. For example, exercise usually makes me feel worse), such as exercise, eating right, having a sleep schedule, having a daily schedule to follow, socializing, a hobby, prayer, maintaining personal hygeine, listening to music, window shopping, etc? And how can the people who support you help you have those things in your life even when you don't have the energy?
I totally agree, depression and trauma make it difficult to see any improvements and positives.

Thanks for taking time to help and reply, I appreciate it.
My partner supports me, I don't have family I can go back to. It puts a strain on him but he tries his very best to help me. 

I'm finding it difficult to get enjoyment out of pretty much anything that I do tbh. I'm keeping a much healthier routine now though, I make sure to shower and eat healthy and go to my appointments etc. But there's definitely a problem with hobbies and happiness, I gave up some hobbies due to the illness and finding new things to become interested in has proven challenging. I stick to very basic self care of baths and tv shows I like instead. 

Work definitely steeply improves my mental state it's keeping myself from anxiety depression etc that becomes an issue then. 
To start off I'll tell you guys I work as a paramedic is a small town USA. I'm working towards my Masters in Social Work. I also suffer from depression, anxiety and PTSD. 
Yesterday, I went to work like every other weekend. We got called to a person that was having some mental health problems and may or may no have taken an over dose of medication. After talking to this person for 20 or so minutes we leave and go to our local bandaid station ( little ER) I have seen it many time but this time it struck a nerve. We brought this person in that was crying, not doing anything wrong and was just needing help. Because said person wouldn't talk they treated this them like shit. She would answer most yes and no questions. But that wasn't what hit me. The doc ( who I have known for a few years) literally man handled her head to look in her eyes ears and mouth. He didn't even bother to ask her anything! He just walked in and started pushing her head around. When if he would have asked this person would have moved and been cooperative. They just didn't want to talk. I was so mad. This person who needed ( and had tried to get help more than once) help and you are treating them like a piece of trash. Personally if I ever had to go to the ER for mental health issues, I'm going to feel like shit anyway, I don't need to be treated like I don't matter because I have mental health problems. 
I have been with the ambulance service for a while now and I have seen it time and time again. We bring in someone who wants to hurt themselves or needs help and doesn't know any other way of getting it, they treat them like trash. 
The mental health system around me is so broken. All these people think, because they don't have depression or anything they are better than them. They all know I suffer from mental health problems and they treat me like they are better than me. I have never once had a crisis. But the fact that I'm on medication to help me, that makes them better. The fact that I do not hide that I'm on medication, makes me a lesser person. Why? None of us asked to have any of these mental health problems! Why treat someone having a broken arm with love and compassion, then turn around and treat the person who is suicidal and WANTING your help to make them better and treat them like they are lesser because their pain is invisible. Their illness is invisible. They wouldn't be there 90% of the time if they didn't want help. 
This is why people hide. This is why the stigma is so strong. Because it is easier to belittle someone that you don't understand instead of trying to learn from them. It's easier to blow them off as an attention seeking person instead of actually asking. Ya ok if the ER is busy that's one thing. Yesterday and most days (small town) not that busy where someone (before they call mental health) can take 2 minutes and try to connect with them and earn their trust. 
Not going to lie, I'm guilty of being jaded and judging a person before even getting to the person. Even after being diagnosed with my own mental health problems. I'm not perfect and I don't expect them to be, but this isn't a one time thing. It's an every time thing. 
I also have been on the receiving end of my little towns stigma reinforcing thinking. I post on my private social media page about mental health issues and my personal story. Well I guess someone decided that because I'm on medication I was not competent enough to do my job. Mind you at the time of this I had not had a panic attack in about 6 months and my depression was very much under control and I was not having any issues. I'm not sure why these people didn't come to me, but they went to my boss. Let's just say my boss doesn't have the best employee/boss skills. She preceded to yelled and belittle me in front of my coworkers. She called me "people like you". Referring to people that have mental health crisis. People like me? I had never been thrown out in like that. I have never been singled out and belittled because of something I didn't ask for and I can not help. That was 4 months ago. I still have not healed. 
I know this rant has been all over this place. Sorry. Just a lot of built up anger. Please no hateful things if you chose to comment.  If you don't like it just pass on. I need support not judgement or meanness. I'm just tired of this stigma that is over us. 
One year I went to the ER more than 3 times in a year for mental health problems. After the first time they started treating me shit, and the word "malingering" got thrown about. Like yea, I really enjoy being put in a locked cell with no bed and toiletries and having all my rights taken away. 

There was one nurse who was really mean but then my SO came in and explained that to them. That I'm always here against my will, not because I wanted to be there. But I was willing to accept help even against my will. Since then she started treating me like a person again.

Last time I went to the ER was because of a severe reaction to an antipsychotic (extrapyramidal symptoms). I saw the nurse there again, but this time I couldn't talk. I was so scared because I couldn't move much either. That was the only time I was treated like a "human" instead of "just another crazy person"
I often feel angry at people who give token "we support mental health awareness" signals. Given an understanding of it, who wouldn't support that - they're clearly just cashing in on sympathy. But then I hear of cases like this, where people sound inhumane yet clearly must know about mental health to some degree. It sounds like your town ought to be retrained in not being jerks. Sorry it's been rough for you, and double sorry you have to stand by and see it continue to others.
When I had my first serious breakdown, my boyfriend and my best friend brought me to one emergency room. Boyfriend told the front desk/triage people that I was suicidal. Whoever that was was extremely unproperly trained because they told me to sit down and wait, even though they should have immediately taken me into a room with nothing to hurt myself with. As we were headed to the car to go to another hospital, a nurse comes running out to get us, but we blew her off to go to this place that deals with mental health cases more often.

I have just been APPALLED at the lack of quality inpatient care. Most facilities, at least around me, put psych cases right in with Dual Diagnosis cases. The last hospital I was at, I had the worst experience. The psychiatrist I met with when I was admitted immediately took me off 90% of what I was on, cold turkey. Then when I complained of shakeyness and not feeling well because I was having withdrawals. He then had the nerve to ask me if I had been using opiates when I came in. And when I said no, I felt like he didnt believe me. I hadnt even been able to meet with my treatment team and they were discussing my discharge. I have been doing extremely poorly recently, but I am doing everything I can to avoid admittance again, because I never get anything positive out of it except some new friends that I'll only speak to for a week or two after discharge.
Sadly, i'm not surprised. Hang in there man and keep up the good work. Whenever I have a crisis, it is the paramedics that are the nicest.  I can't praise the London Ambulance Service enough. I might actually send them an email of appreciation or something. You guys are all angels. 
I've often wondered what exactly an ER can do for a mental health issue. It's not like they can stitch it back together or anything.
I've had interactions in both small towns and large cities. By far the small towns are the worst. It sounds like perhaps you should talk with that MD. And perhaps tell your boss to go fuck himself. 
Exactly! No love in the mental illness sector. I went to the ER about a week ago, and there was this woman talking to me. She appeared what you would call, a bit delusional, but I tried keeping the conversation with her. A janitor came by and stared at her like there was something wrong with her/disgust. WTF! Seriously, the stigma is strong with this one.
People with mental health problems usually are treated like dogshit. 
They can also treat you with kindness and respect. But they can keep you safe from hurting yourself or others while you are having a crisis. If you are having a panic attack they can calm you down and if you are being violent due to a psychiatric break they can give you medication to calm you down until they can get you till a facility that can do more for you.
Hello.  My name is Beckie, and I started a blog basically to stop the "Stigma" such as "People like us."  I have mental health illness disorders and when (and, still am) working with a mental health facility, I wanted to "Pay to it Forward."  In other words, Help others by providing resources, organizations and helpful information to those of us that deal with this daily.  I hope you can find it helpful.  My site is as follows: beckiesmentalmess@wordpess.com / I have a blog post pertaining to what is referred as WRAP.  Wellness Recovery Action Plan.  You may want to check that out. 
Thank you for your time.  I hope that you & the people you help along the way feel better.
Take care,
Beckie
I hear you. It really is a cruel and unusual situation to be vulnerable and seeking help, only to be harmed by those you seek help from. And be told that it is helping you. It gets more messed up when you are not allowed to diagnose or treat yourself - any help you receive is determined and authorized by these people that harm you. They are payed to do this. Society calls it helping you.

Purely physical illnesses respond dramatically to the socioemotional aspects of healthcare yet little regard is given to the socioemotional treatment of psychiatric patients. Stigmatization and disempowerment are so terrible for mental health. It seems like institutional society commonly gaslights psychiatric patients and the resulting internal conflict can really make you fucking crazy.

Makes my head wobbly thinking about this stuff.... rage, despair, helplessness and hopelessness.

I'm glad people like you understand.
So true. Not going to lie , I'm a paramedic and I'm guilty of it. And I have depression anxiety and ptsd. Sometimes when they are being violent or abusing the system ( we had one that got arrested she was calling so much, all it would have took to help her is her take her meds all the time) I feel like shit afterwards but no one is perfect 
Thanks I know I try. I live in the US and it is crazy that this is like a world problem.. I was just hoping it was just my little town.. sadly I have been proven wrong. I'm sure the paramedics would like an email or card. We honestly do appreciate thank you cards /emails 
Unfortunately talking to the MD would be pointless and talking to my boss would be less... if i wasn't in school I would have already quit my job and found another one but I don't want to take the chance of not being able to get the shifts that work with my school 
I find that small towns are better than large ones with showing compassion. Your comment sounds like you need some selfcare. That's terrible advice to give.
Thank you
I'm glad we've had alternate experiences. In my case, smaller communities have tended to have an excellent combination of higher stigma, less training, less experience (presumably because rural), and generally stupider MD/DOs. Whereas large cities, they basically just don't care. You're probably the 15th+ psych/neuro ptn they've contacted that day. And they're probably in residence anyway so they don't know whats going on regardless. I will say "[greyhound therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhound_therapy)" tends to be more common (in my experience) in larger cities.

I had originally written out a longer response to the OP, but decided to shorten it to the point. I don't think it's bad advice to try and correct the MD. Actually telling your boss to fuck himself might not be the smartest thing to do, but standing up for yourself; which is what I meant, I think is. 

Saying I need some selfcare is cute. Not that it matters, or you care; but, I stay compliant with my medications, appointments, therapies, and volunteer with mental health organizations. In addition to doing my work as a grad student in a different, but related subject. 
I found fault with telling someone to do something you'd not do yourself in his postion. Why would you assume that rural areas are less trained and the medical staff stupider? Because of some sort of projection of your belief  system towards rural Americans? 
Considering I grew up, and currently live in rural America I'm not projecting anything. They are less trained because their hospitals, police departments and other services don't receive as much funding as larger areas. Simply because of a combination of less tax income, and less need for specialized training since incidence is lower. That isn't speculation. I'm assuming that, in general, the MD/DOs are stupider based on a combination of my interactions with them, and how the economy works.

What I suggested is what I would do. Most of my family are RNs and EMTs, correcting a doctor is a perfectly normal thing to do. And her boss woulda pissed me off something fierce. 

GREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - The founder of the Green Bay-based Project Semicolon organization has died at age 31.

The Project Semicolon website shows an image of Amy Bleuel with the dates 1985-2017. An obituary lists her date of death as March 24.

There were no immediate details about the cause of death.

Project Semicolon is a movement to help people battling depression and self-harm. Bleuel founded the organization after her father died by suicide.

"It's reached approximately 2.5-to-3 million people in 90 different countries," Bleuel told Action 2 News in 2015.

Project Semicolon is active on social media. Some followers get the semicolon symbol as a tattoo.

An obituary says Amy leaves behind a husband, David.

Family and friends are invited to a service at Pfotenhauer Funeral Home on Saturday, April 1.

I heard about this last night, very upsetting. She saved so many lives. 
I love my semicolon tattoo and what is represents. I'm sorry to hear of Amy's death. Her cause will live on. 
Did they tattoo a period on her arm, post mortem? 
Article says cause of death was as suicide. My heart goes out to her family and loved ones. 
I think the organization should be okay, this proves we still need it to help others and bring awareness.
Any word on the cause of death? Article didn't say.  If it was suicide then what does that mean for the project?  Does it lose credibility?  If not, does it make her a stronger symbol for those battling depression?
Damn, this is very sad. 
Noooo :(
> There were no immediate details about the cause of death.

article says "There were no immediate details about the cause of death."
I personally don't think it will make the project lose credibility. I think it will show that this project is still needed and it's voice needs to be louder so it can be heard. 
The Mighty claims to have confirmed it was a suicide. 
no word and i doubt there will be any "official" explanation.

Do you know how it feels to hurt so badly inside that the only option of relief you see is to take your own life? I'm assuming you do not, and I don't wish for you or anyone else to have to understand that pain. However, you have absolutely no right to cast judgement on those who do know that pain and do take their life.

edit: I am sorry I made an ad-hominem attack on you in my rage at your comment, I was caught up in anger at the moment. But it makes me no better a person when I resort to name-calling. I may disagree with your view but I apologize for the name calling
You "doubt that brain chemicals were the culprit"?  What is the basis for that doubt?
You obviously didn't read what I wrote.
I'm a doubting Thomas.

Parents tell themselves stories that give an account, and often either don't understand, or worse, do, but tell a story to make it all a neat package. The condition she was in was unconscionable. I find the mother calling her brave a bit disgusting, especially if she had more of a clue for her daughter's experience than she lets on, which I think is quite possible. It seems unkind, I'm sure, to view the mother as being in bad faith. But I just feel it's possible. This is reddit, I'm not talking to her here, and probably wouldn't say it to her. But I have a minority view that I feel obligated to express. I gave ample indication that I was fully aware that the trauma involved can be beyond comprehension, beyond bad, beyond worse and even beyond the worst. I don't need to say more than that, really.

Often "demons" means something along the line of a kind of conscience that admonishes. It turns into a syndrome. There seems to be more to understand about it. 
1) Awhile back (late January) I made a suicide attempt. I told my therapist about it (in early February), and also that I was still feeling suicidal. She said, "If you're still truly suicidal, you would have tried again when it failed the first time!" I understood what she meant, but the way she phrased it could've come across as encouraging someone to commit suicide! 

2) During that same therapy session, I told my therapist that I didn't think I'd make it through the week, and would like to commit myself to an inpatient psych ward. She said, "What sort of attention are you looking to get from doing that?" I explained that it had nothing to do with "getting attention", and everything to do with keeping myself safe. She disagreed, and told me: "It's okay that you need this attention. Everyone needs attention sometimes."

3) My therapist was also very pushy about the idea that I should go back to college. I do not like school, and right now I can barely care for myself, so it's out of the question. Respectfully I told her that I didn't think I would be able to take that advice. She kept pushing. I am not a good student, and school is just about the most stressful thing that I could choose to do! Furthermore, how on earth would I pay for it with no income???  I'm 27, and haven't been in school for six years now, so it's not like I recently dropped out.  

4) I took myself to a local crisis center that same day, and checked myself in. This place holds people for no more than 24 hours, and then transfers them if there's a need. The doctor at the crisis place told me, "Depression is a choice. You can choose to not be depressed. You're young and pretty and intelligent-- why aren't you giving back to the community?" When I told her that I'm unable to perform basic life functions like even doing my own laundry, she told me, "All the more reason to get out there and give back to the community because you owe it to them!"

5) The 24-hour crisis place transferred me to a psychiatric ward on a 5150 hold. (California terms for being on an involuntary 72-hour hold.) The doctor at the psych ward told me sarcastically, "You're really doing the merry-go-round with meds, aren't you? Do you like that? Does that make you happy?" Yes, I've tried a variety of meds, but that is because I want to find an antidepressant that HELPS me the way Prozac used to. I told the doctor this. He said, "It's not a medication problem, it's a therapy problem!" I let him know that I am in therapy, and have been in therapy since 2009. He promptly said, "Then it's not a medication problem or a therapy problem, it's a YOU problem." I started sobbing, and he left the room. 

6) Between the crisis place and the psych ward I was transferred to, I spent four days seeking help, and spent the majority of that time crying or sleeping. The doctor at the psych ward diagnosed me with bipolar, which is fairly ridiculous. I was not manic, and I've never been manic. My regular psychiatrist thinks it's ridiculous that I was ever diagnosed with bipolar.

7) While I was in the psych ward, they changed my antidepressant to a new one. Now I'm on Celexa, which doesn't work any more than the others did.  The psych ward said they'd be releasing me with a 30-day supply of medication, as well as a prescription for more. It wasn't until I got home that I realized I'd been given neither. Although that actually worked out, because I had an appointment with my regular psychiatrist about a week later. 

8) Recently I had my regular DBT group session. The reason I'm able to see an individual therapist is because I am also in DBT group. I asked the DBT group leader what the process would be to request a different therapist. The group leader asked me why I wanted to, and I told her some of the recent things my therapist has said to me. The DBT leader said that I was being "willful" because I don't want to go back to school like my therapist suggested. Also, she said that it's not possible to request a new therapist without first confronting my current therapist about the issues, and then my therapist, my DBT leaders, and my psychiatrist all have a group meeting to decide whether my request has merit. (And the DBT leader told me that my request does not have merit.)

9) A week ago I saw my regular psychiatrist. While I had been in the psych ward, my mom apparently called him and talked to him for quite awhile. (He did respect patient confidentiality and only listened to her talk.)  I don't know what she told him, but it seemed like she claimed that I'm either fine or making things up. Prior to this conversation with her, my psychiatrist has been very supportive of me, but that all changed this past week!

10) At this appointment, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder, with "micro hallucinations". I suspect he gave me the BPD diagnosis because my therapist or my mom may have told him I was seeking attention. The only part of that diagnosis that actually fits is the fact that I have a history of self injury. Everything else my psychiatrist mentioned was about how the person with BPD is impulsive (I'm not at all), has reckless behavior like doing drugs/wild driving (I don't), and goes to great lengths for attention (I was seeking help, not attention). I feel that this diagnosis does not fit me and that I was given this diagnosis suddenly after seeing him for six months and it never being brought up before.

11) I'm also confused about the "micro hallucinations" part. I have hallucinations and paranoia, and have previously been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I was not aware that there was any differentiation between "regular" hallucinations versus "micro" hallucinations! Now I'm wondering... if what I thought were "regular" hallucinations are in fact only "micro" hallucinations, did I truly hallucinate anything at all?  

12) My psychiatrist told me that he's "not getting the whole story" about my relationship with my mom. I've told him in the past how she was physically abusive to me and is currently very controlling while I stay with her. He told me that I have to confront her and resolve my problematic relationship with her, which I do not wish to do. (Resolve it, yes. Confront her, no. I have PTSD.) 

13) He lectured me about how the entire cause of my severe depression is not depression itself, but is all due to residual feelings I have about my mom. He told me that medication will not help me, and that I do not have depression-- what I have is an unwillingness to work hard enough in therapy! I have been putting a lot of effort into therapy, and was hurt when he told me that.  He told me that I don't have depression, and may not even have PTSD!

14) When I was in the psych ward recently, they classified me as homeless. (This is correct: I was illegally evicted in late January, and am currently staying with my parents which is a short term solution only!) They told me that I was eligible for a public housing program in this county. However, since the psych ward was technically in a different county, they could not write the necessary referral. I was told that my psychiatrist or therapist could, though, since it just has to be a mental health professional who's treating me. 

15) So I asked my psychiatrist to write me a referral to this organization with the housing program. He told me that he wouldn't, since I'm "not homeless"! He said, "Since you're able to stay with your parents, you DO have a home!" The problem is, my parents live in a retirement community that only allows visitors for a certain length of time. I explained this to him. My psychiatrist told me that if I really want to be independent, I would simply get a job and get my own place! 

16) I've been unable to work for two years now, and have been applying for SSDI. Previously, my psychiatrist told me that he agrees I'm disabled, and that he supported me in applying for Disability. Now he's completely changed his mind, and I don't understand why!  I need to reapply for SSDI, but I worry about listing him or the others in case they are contacted and tell the Social Security that I'm miraculously able to work!

17) In my late teens I had a back injury (herniated disc) that required surgery.  It solved the problem until recently, when I managed to get the same injury.  My psychiatrist also told me that I don't currently have a back injury (after watching me barely able to walk), and don't have a history of back injuries!  He told me that it's "unresolved anger".  I said, "Funny, my surgeon ten years ago sure thought I had an injury!  My psychiatrist said, "Any surgeon will cut you open for the right price."  He told me not to seek the MRI results for my current injury.  He told me that if I work harder in therapy, the back pain will resolve itself...  (I went ahead and got the results of my MRI.  Whaddya know, another herniated disc and I need surgery for it again.)  I almost feel like bringing in my old MRIs from ten years ago and pointing out the visible herniation, and/or bringing in the typed notes from my recent MRI results at my next appointment with him!

18) I am still very depressed and actively suicidal. Now I'm scared to go back to anyone for help. What if they just tell me that I am making it up for attention?  I've having a LOT of trouble struggling to define what's real.  Do I have this severe back pain, or am I just seeking attention?  Do I limp more when I'm around someone, or is the limping when I'm alone just as bad?  Was it fair for me to tell my therapist that I'd made a suicide attempt, or was that something I did to manipulate her?  When is it "okay" to seek help, and at which point should I give up?

EDIT: I complained mightily to my regular psychiatrist about his sudden diagnosis of borderline. He brought in the medical director and we had a joint appointment with her to assess me. She decided that I do not have borderline, but sometimes they "need to find a diagnosis for insurance purposes". (I am paraphrasing what she said about that.)

This medical director is going to be my new treating psychiatrist, and they're allowing me to switch to a new therapist, too!  The therapist should be contacting me soon-- I was told mid-April. 
I am so sorry that you are having this kind of time just trying to get the help you need, from what sound like completely unprofessional practitioners. 

I know it's a lot of work but if you need the help, please continue to seek it out until you get to a place that you feel safe and comfortable. Feel free to PM me if you don't fee comfortable publically sharing what country you're in and I can give you a long-distance hand trying to find some new and better resources for you. We went through a lot of this when my mother was in and out of the hospital for her schizophrenia.

'You're young and pretty and intelligent... You're not depressed' 

Goddamn that sentiment hit home for me op, no one takes my suffering seriously either they all dismiss me because I was born with a cutesy face. 

It sucks. I just want help. I just want to be able to feel well again. I don't want to feel soul-crushingly depressed over normal life shit. I want to get better. I want someone to take me seriously. But they don't. 

Huge hugs for you op. Huge hugs for us. 

You are not alone. 

I'm so sorry. These stories are all horrible, and yet they don't surprise me at all. 

I can relate to a lot of that and have even gotten the same "You're young, pretty, and smart, so you shouldn't be depressed" speech. A psych NP I saw in the hospital even told me that he understands why everyone else in the hospital wants to kill themselves, but he doesn't understand why I would because I'm smart. Gee, way to insult everyone at once there. 

I really hope you find something that works for you. Is finding a new treatment team at all an option for you? 
That really, really, really sucks.  Sounds like it's time to find some new treatment people.  I'm sorry that the ones that you have were so unprofessional.  I think that what you did by trying to keep yourself safe was absolutely the most responsible thing that you could have done, and that they were ridiculous to guilt you about that.  Good for you for taking care of yourself even if they weren't taking you seriously.  I've heard similar things from doctors before - I too went through a LOT of meds before I found a combination that worked for me, and before I found the right combination I saw a shrink that said "You've tried so many medications, it's clear that you don't have a chemical problem, you just have an attitude problem."  She was wrong.  Really wrong.  But I let that get in my head and didn't get any more treatment for two years, and it was hell.  Don't let these "health care providers" do that to you.  Just because you've been through several different combinations doesn't mean that there's not one that will help you.

In answer to the last question you ask, it is okay to seek help if you feel like you need help.  Period.  Asking for help takes a lot of energy and a good amount of self-awareness, and I'm sorry you haven't been getting support when you do that.

I went for a long stretch of time without getting a decent treatment plan nailed down, changing providers frequently, etc.  It was miserable.  I finally found a program that was really helpful to me, an intensive outpatient program where there were four hours of group therapy (of different types), plus one-on-one visits with a psychiatrist at least once a week, usually twice, plus one-on-one visits with a counselor if I requested them.  It's in LA County, but maybe there's something similar a little closer to you?  I wound up there after a 5150, and it's the best thing that ever happened to me treatment wise.

As far as SSDI goes, you might consider finding a lawyer to help with the process.  I know paying someone to do that stinks, but they take money out of your initial payment (so no direct out of pocket costs) and since they don't get paid unless your claim is approved they have a substantial incentive to work really hard to get benefits for you.  Just something to think about.

I really hope that things get better for you soon.  Don't stop asking for help - you have to be your own advocate, and you're the one that has to live in your head.  If inside your head isn't healthy for you, then keep going.
Are all psychiatric facilities like this? My experience with one was only about a 10th as bad as what OP is describing, but I was only 16 and it seemed to me like everyone there was clearly incompetent. Most memorably, staff made fun of me and basically said that I didn't have any "real" problems that would give a good reason for me to have depression. The only decent psychologists/psychiatrists I have come across were all private practice. 

Anyway, I'm not trying to hijack. I just wanted to let you know that I believe you, it sucks, and I'm sorry. It sounds like the place you go to is truly the worst ever. 
I am so sorry you are having such an awful time finding someone to listen to you and actually hear what you are saying. I'm a Nurse and I'm appalled by the way you have been treated. If thats the way you feel though, then that is your truth and it doesn't matter what they think. If you have a herniate disk, I am positive that you aren't imagining the pain. Just like, "Any surgeon will cut you open for the right price." So will a psychiatrist 'listen' for the right price. Don't let them talk you out of your pain. Of course it was fair to share the fact that you had made a suicide attempt, we want to know so we can prevent that! Not all Dr.s are so ignorant. It is always ok to receive help. You are incredibly strong for continuing to seek help, when so many people are giving you reasons to give up. Don't give up. Keep being better than that and get what you need.    
*What's this insulin bullshit you're talking about???*


*You have a choice!*
I'm so sorry about everything that has happened and is happening to you. It sounds very overwhelming and totally confusing. There is every reason for you to be doubting what is and what isn't real. The people in your life aren't making it very easy for you.

In terms of switching therapists, I would reccommend looking into universities around your area. Often, they have psychology phd/ psy.d. student-run clinics that offer free or very low cost rates for individual counseling and group counseling. They might also have an on-site psychiatrist or a nurse that can perscribe medication.

Wishing you all the best.
If you want oppinion, scrap all the shrinks you're seeing and go for help somewhere else, it sounds to me like all these people you are seeing dont have a clue what they are talking about, im in the uk here so i dont know how it all works across the pond but if a psychologist told me i had a choice in how i felt i would put in a formal complaint and request a new doctor due to his unprofessionalism.

I'm in the Central Valley of California.  I'll message you the exact county.

Previous psychiatrists actually diagnosed me with sz!  Paranoid schizophrenia, to be exact.  But my current psychiatrist disagrees with that diagnosis, saying that I'm too lucid and don't exhibit enough of the negative symptoms.  Last September he diagnosed me with "PTSD with psychosis and paranoia", or something like that.  

Now he's saying that I may not have PTSD at all!  I believe I do, and several previous psychiatrist have said so, too.  They said that I showed symptoms of it, but at the time they were assessing me for the sz, so we didn't pursue PTSD.
I'm working on ditching these people.  Problem is, I see all three (psych, therapist, and DBT group) through the same organization.  And this is my county's organization.  

"There comes a point where bad care is worse than no care, and it sounds like you're close, if not already there."  The problem is, I can't go off my meds.  So I can't just stop seeing them.  Also, if I spontaneously discontinue medical help, and become noncompliant with my medication, it doesn't exactly speak well for my Disability application! ("If she's not even bothering to see a psychiatrist regularly or take meds, she can't be that bad off!")

I'm fairly sure that my mom didn't "tell" my psychiatrist that I have BPD.  She has NO history of mental illness in her own family (I'm adopted), and is VERY unfamiliar with it.  Like, unfamiliar to the extent that she has never heard of PTSD, and thinks eating more vegetables would cure schizophrenia!  What she probably told him is that I'm making everything up, which he then translated to: this patient has BPD!

I previously applied for SSDI, and was evaluated by one of their own people.  They told me that this person was to evaluate me, and all she did was ask me some basic questions to test my memory.  (Who is the current US President?  Who was the previous President?  Listen to these three words and repeat them back later.  What is today's date?" etc...)  They told me that I was still able to work, and I was denied Disability.  

I'm truly not sure HOW they came to this conclusion, as both then and now I'm not able to perform basic life skills like showering regularly, getting dressed daily, doing my own laundry (one load each week), or making more than about one meal a day.  (And "making food" for me means heating up a can of soup because that's all I can handle.)  


Exactly.  And thank you!  
I'd LOVE to find a new treatment team!  I heard a rumor that the housing program I'm trying to get into would provide me with a different treatment team. 

My psychiatrist refused to write the referral I need for that, but I'm going to ask my therapist on Monday if she will!
I HAD meds that worked.  Prozac was like a miracle drug for me, but it suddenly quit working after five years on it.  That was a few years ago, and I still haven't managed to find another antidepressant that does anything!  I've tried Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Paxil, and currently am on Celexa.  

I have to start the SSDI application process all over.  When I went down there this past fall to update them with my new contact info (I'd moved), they told me that I had never applied, and that there was no record of me in the system.  

Since then I haven't had the spoons to re-apply.  I do plan on getting a lawyer, but first I have to start the application process.  This will be the fourth or fifth time I've applied in two years.  
Do you mean psych wards?  No, they're not. I wanted to go to a different one, but it was full so I got transferred to the one outside the county. 
Thanks!  What field do you work in?
What is this cancer?  This broken arm?  You have a choice!
Wouldn't I need to be a student at the university, though?
I should have put in a complaint, but I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to rock the boat.  Plus I was doing so poorly at the time that I didn't think to do that, and now I have no idea what the doctor's name is.
You're absolutely right. That's why I'm continuing to attend DBT to learn coping skills!

> And this is my county's organization.

That might be your problem. When I was suicidal I was referred to a state-run mental health facility. My therapist was awful and my psychiatrist was insane (no pun intended.) I'll have a drink (**a** drink) every once in a while and she screamed at me and said she wouldn't treat me again unless I poured out every bit of alcohol and got rid of every gun I had. I found a private facility that my insurance covers and haven't looked back since.
Ugh on the SSDI thing.  The fact that it takes ages for a claim to be processed doesn't help either, I'm sure.  

Have you asked about taking Prozac again?  I was on it for a while and it worked well, but after taking it for a long time it quit being as effective.  My psych tried a few other things, but none worked as well.  Then he mentioned that it had been long enough that the Prozac might work again.  It did.  If that was great for you, maybe you could revisit it?
Anytime! I'm a Pediatric Nurse and I work in the community with all sorts of clients. But, I'm very passionate about mental health.
No not at all. Generally (at least in my area), the university has two counseling programs: 1 for their students, and 1 that is student-run and open to the public. 

The program for actual students is run by the school, and is staffed with professional psychologists (who've already completed their education). The student run program is staffed by psy.d or psychology phd students. It is open to the public, so anyone can use their services, provided they have openings available.  It provides training for the students, and allows you (the client) to pay a greatly reduced rate for their services. Kind of like when you get your hair cut by someone still in cosmotology/beauty school and pay them a lot less. Does that make sense?
I'm really glad that you have a working med!  My doc actually took me off the Abilify on January 7th, so I'm not on any antipsychotics for the first time in three years. 

It's great that you were able to get Disability right away!  At least the system isn't broken for all of us. 

I was denied the first three times I applied. The fourth time they lost my application and said there was no record of me ever applying!  So I am trying to get the motivation to go through this again. My aunt used to be a social worker and helped me do a write up of how my symptoms affect me. Hopefully that helps!
I've done quite a bit of asking around, and from what I hear my ONLY option is the county's healthcare programs.  

I have Medi-Cal insurance for California's low income people.  I am not sure if it would cover a private facility.  
They tell me it takes 3-5 months for a claim here in California to receive the initial response. However, assuming one goes through the find-a-lawyer process and an appeal, it's more like 18 months. 
I didn't think of trying Prozac again!  I will ask my psychiatrist. At the time it quit working, we spent a number of months increasing my dose but that didn't help. 
It makes perfect sense! 

I have zero income, zero savings, and rely on my Medi-Cal health insurance to fully cover the costs of my treatment. 

Would seeing someone at a university be covered by my insurance, which is intended for lower-income people?

I'm acutally not sure if your insurance would play any sort of role in the actual counseling sessions. At the university by me, you just talk to your therapist and tell them what you can afford. It can be nothing, or it could go up to $30 per session. Insurance does not play a role in that part. It's kind of an honor system I guess. Your insurance would play a role if you needed a prescription or something though.

I hope that helps! I would just call universities in your area and see if it's something they offer and what the terms and conditions are. Good luck :)
Ah. I do need to be able to stay on my meds. 

Actually, my regular psychiatrist is moving on (he is a Resident), so I'm now being assigned to the medical director through the same county program. 

Also I'm supposed to be getting a new therapist once she comes back from maternity leave! 

So I think I'll wait a few months and see how that goes first. 

Ha! I saw this on my facebook page this morning and was going to post it here!
Censoring my other post with downvotes *also* is not a counter argument.

- Personal attacks != a counter argument.

- Censorship != a counter argument.
"Mental illness" *shouldn't* be treated like physical illness.  "Mental illness" is simply a label for alleged behaviors & feelings.  

ie, *some* people's mental conditions are serious, but a significant amount are fake. (Like how many energetic kids are labeled ADHD.)

A big part of "mental illness" accusations are just non-scientific insults against normal people.

It can be a weapon/insult, & be used to dishonestly justify violence.  

And the simple truth is the mind can't have an infection/illness.  Instead, "mental condition" should be said.

Go spend 5 minutes around a clinical population and it will be apperant how much bullshit you are full off. 
Sure, some people are falsely diagnosed. That doesn't make the suffering of people who truly have the disease any less.

Partly you are right, as regards certain aspects of causation. At the very same time, the *analogy* is very powerful and for some is utterly true. Some psychological conditions, states, persisting problems, etc., are so powerful, so debilitating, that they are *like* physical ailments in terms of the practical matter of dealing with others, facing the world, being able to function, etc. 

You are on guard against very important things and are right that viewing "mental illness" (even that term is problematic if you ask me) as a physical condition on the same order as the flu or MS or whatever can be used for all manner of violence and brutal practices.

It's striking, however, that you leave out the entire range on the *other* end of the spectrum from the "faking it" end: intractable, debilitating, potentially and demonstrably lethal, enormously painful, etc. Indeed, at that end of the spectrum lies some of the very worst conditions, for essential reasons, that humans can experience. How about giving that end its due? Think about it: a person in a decent mental condition is beset by a difficult physical illness, and has to fight the illness (as they say), and it is hard enough. But what if the problem is the fighter themselves? What does it mean to have a very bad mental condition? What *would that have to mean*? Wouldn't that have to mean something so personal, intimate, so much an aspect of who and how one is in their innermost self, that it would amount to the worst sort of condition possible? 

Add to this that the violence you speak of it itself, at least in part, psychological: the psychological violence of suffering the attribution of physical causation. What would that feel like, I wonder? Is that a mental condition? I suppose so. But what would that be like? How would one experience that? After all, all of one's thoughts, feelings, reactions, etc., would be seen as symptoms of some biological causation, like if someone were to view all of your comments, not just here, but anywhere, as some result of a disease? 
> [emotion]

1. Emotion != a counter argument. 

2. There isn't a "clinical" population.  That's a propaganda term for innocent people violently attacked & enslaved (imprisoned) without due process.

  (Without any evidence/conviction for the accusations against them.)

  The psychiatrist's "reasoning" is simply "S/he was accused of X, therefore it is true."

  And despite how psychiatrists demonize their prey, as potentially evil (the modern version of the witch), they are really simply innocent people assumed guilty without evidence/conviction of a crime.

>  of people who truly have the disease any less.

There's no disease.  There's people suffering from various mental conditions, but a disease is not something purely imagined to sell drugs & alleged "treatments."

ie 100% of people mentally "diagnosed" are falsely diagnosed, since no mental condition is an illness.

>  How about giving that end its due? 

I didn't say there weren't seriously suffering people.  I'm simply saying the word "condition" is factually accurate.  It doesn't assume a physical defect.

People suffer (mentally) for a bunch of reasons like social causes, oppression by the state/rulers &  sometimes it could be the brain. 

But the psychiatric industry (instead of accepting that) wants to ignore all of that complexity, & just assume everyone has a defective brain.

> Add to this that the violence you speak of it

I meant violence literally.  ie force (police, prisons, etc) used against people who were accused of various evils without trial. 

Despite how they're demonized & described as guilty by psychiatrists, they're really simply innocent/unconvicted people.




okay whatever man. Most people who recieve mental health services do so out of their own free will in order to improve their happiness and level of functioning. 
You should be able to mean violence literally without having to mean only physical coercion and attack.

I wanted to tell all of your wonderful redditors that took the time to comment yesterday that I sincerely appreciate your tips and advice! Because of you, I was able to find a counseling program through the local university, that I am currently waitlisted for (but it's only a 3 week waitlist). Also, they have a DBT group which starts in the next few weeks that I have every intention of signing up for. I've done DBT before and had good results (but only because I didn't take it too seriously) - so this time I will take it VERY seriously and know I'll get GREAT results!!

Thank you again, Reddit!!!!
Glad to hear it. Good luck!
It's fantastic to hear that you're getting help without breaking the bank! Good on you for getting on that ASAP.
Good luck!
Awesome! 
Great! =) Good luck to you!
Greedy little Doctors need the money for their ever growing mansions and car collections. But you're all going to keep getting ass fucked cause nobody seems to bother trying to change anything anymore. everyone just sits around and accepts it like a bunch of useless pussies. Downvotes incoming... 
Do you not realize a therapist makes $40,000 a year at best? A social worker even less? A psychologist $65,000 a year? Look at the department of labor salary handbook. In addition thousands of dollars in student loan debt? I think your beef is elsewhere buddy. 
oh no, my $65,000 salary is soooo low! never mind these suicidal people and their problems i have to gain more capital. this is an american problem anyway. Thank god i live somewhere civilized that provides free healthcare. think of how many people have blown their fucking brains out cause they can't afford to escape their mental health issue. 

The title says it all. USA capitalizes education and healthcare far too much. This wouldn't happen in a country worth its salt. Maybe one day you'll all realise that being ultra capitalist wankstains is not the way to live. We didn't plant seeds and build mud huts all those years ago so we could live in a massive, uncaring free for all.

Edit: you know its true and you know you're gonna downvote it cause I offended the GLORIOUS USA

yeah but you can take the engineer down if you really cared enough.

obviously dickhead.... thats why you all come together to defeat it. but no... everyone is so fucking lazy and defeatist they cant be bothered to get off their couch and change anything. life sucks (because of this changeable thing) but we'll just swallow the pill and keep going
[deleted]
soz dad. im not threatening anyone by suggesting we adopt a fierce attitude that gets shit done quickly. if you wanna spend decades pussyfooting around trying to get the world to bend to your will then go ahead. its attitudes like that that cause change to happen so slowly, and when you're in poor health time is suffering. 

BPD is a mental illness that still has a very negative stigma. I find that there's a real lack of empathy and, honestly, almost hatred toward those with this mental illness. I'm not sure how to change this. It might seem silly, but I feel like we need a great film or character to come out that deals with BPD in an empathetic way (like A Beautiful Mind did with schizophrenia). It's really strange and defeating to hide such a big part of my life. I hope that one day BPD and all mental illnesses will be viewed in the same light as chronic illnesses.
Thanks for posting this. It's too bad somebody's bitter ex had to ruin it.
Exciting! I really hope more awareness is spread of how it's an understandable reaction to early trauma and/or invalidation, and how (in the UK at least) it's associated with really unacceptable standards of care and treatment from mental health professionals compared to other mental health diagnoses.
I'm going to celebrate by listening to Kanye. I laugh now when I hear the one line where he says have you ever had shoes without any laces
[deleted]
They need to teach about it in high schools honestly. And if they make a movie is needs to be correct. A Beautiful Mind got a lot of things wrong. 
Literally the first post I read and it's some jackass crapping all over borderlines.

We already have horrible self-esteem, we're already stigmatized and viewed as monsters within the mental health community. You're really helping with your shitty comments. 
Awareness is awareness, it's always good right? There should be more taught about mental health in school. At the moment, you learn nothing.
[deleted]
True
You didn't just sound callous, you sounded like an asshole. Let me know what your mental illness is so I can crap all over it when your awareness month comes up. If this is the way people are treated in a mental illness sub, I don't want to be part of it. 
That's not cynicism. That's justification for vilifying an entire group of people suffering from a severe and painful illness.
He has obviously had some previous negative experience with people with BPD and is still hurt from those experience. This is why it's important for months of recognition for certain disorders; so we can educate and discuss those disorders in a civil manner. Yes, he could have been more tactful in his comments, but calling him an asshole is unlikely to change his mind. This just means we need to work to try and educate said individual about BPD and explain how his experiences aren't a blanket example for an entire group of people who suffer from it.
Note that I didn't treat any particular person any type of way. I hope schizophrenia doesn't have an awareness month or that would be when they come for us (paranoia! Team activate!)
[deleted]
Spoken like an apologist for the aggressor. 

It is not not incumbent upon me, the sufferer, to be the bigger person or to educate the ignorant and unkind. I am not here to serve as anyone's example. I didn't sign up to teach a course on borderline personality disorder. As illustrated by his response to me, he isn't interested in being educated. 

Why don't you lecture *him* on the proper way to speak to someone who's suffering, rather than me, the person who was hurt? 
Thank you. I wrote another comment kinda explaining myself better. It was because I was listening to my music library on random and noticed that I have many songs about BPD because I sought them out to understand in happier times.
BPD clearly needs an awareness month because of ignorant, insensitive jackasses like you.
I wasn't trying to lecture anyone. I in no way condoned what he said and made that clear. I was merely stating that education is key to the elimination of misconceptions and stereotypes regarding the disorder. I also was not instructing you specifically to do this, but meant the community as a whole. If we aren't educating those who spread false information or who hold negative views towards those with disorders, what difference are we making? That's the point of 'Awareness Months'. To bring awareness to the disorder and to educate.
[deleted]
I've already alerted a moderator to the existence of your comments. Don't press your luck with me.

I'm just turned 27 and things seem that way. I'm laying in bed now. I'm self employed and am supposed to be working. I feel safe here in my bed. I don't want to go out into the big world and I don't have the mental or emotional energy to do so, to be honest. I know in the long run it will be bad for me, but I just honestly wish that I could curl up in a ball and disappear. I don't see any point in anything I do or don't do. I'm comfortable here in my bed, so why get up?  
Make it a moving target. Happy is a huge goal so it's baby steps the whole way. Life in tiny moments and forgive yourself for failures and bad days.
About 5 years back I was suicidal. But I met a therapist who really helped me work on myself and helped me develop some basic skills. Today I'm happier than I ever was. I've made new friends, and can now socialize with people, have a stable job and in the recent months learnt how to drive a manual transmission car.  

Did I know I could do this one day? No. What did I feel earlier? I felt hopeless. I saw only bad things in the future. But I benefited tremendously from the therapist and improved myself. If someone were to ask me earlier whether I *felt* that my life would change I would say definitely not.

Today I know that that feeling is part of depression. When you're depressed the future looks bleak and you feel convinced by it. But it's your feelings that are really bleak. The future - that's depend on what you do with this bleakness today. 
I approach my chronic depression like my chronic illness: keep working on it; never give up. Just the hope alone of a possible better future is very helpful to lift your mood. 

I think there are two components of depression: 1) your situation, and 2) your body's state. 

I continuously analyze what is going on in my life and I fix or remove things that are keeping my mood low and I add or increase that which keeps my mood higher. 

Some of the things I've done to prevent my mood from lowering:

* break up with a partner
* move to minimize commute
* move to avoid shitty neighbors 
* move to save money
* stand up for myself at a job
* quit a toxic work environment 
* get a higher paying job
* get a new therapist 

Things I've done to raise my mood:

* always keep an animal companion 
* rented studio space for my artwork 
* took our only desk space to dedicate to making artwork
* gave myself a budget to self indulge

(unfortunately, there aren't many things that elevate my mood) 

I'm totally willing to turn my life upside down if I think it will raise my mood. I have to. If I lose my sanity (which I can), then I lose everything. 

The second thing is your body's state. Sometimes you need meds. If you can't figure it out after years, then just go for trying meds. I was ardently against medication for years, and I wish I wasn't. I feel I wasted years of my life. 

Meds aren't the end all be all answer. I see it as clearing off the desk - it just makes it easier to do the work that needs to be done. It gives you a buffer. It slows down the speed of getting depressed so you have time to see it and make the necessary changes to prevent falling further. But if your situation keeps attacking you and you don't stop it, you'll fall into a deep depression no matter what medication you're taking. 

You can improve your body in other ways, like keeping healthy. Eating well. Ensure you have your proper vitamins (do you really have enough vitamin D?). Keep your muscles moving and flexible. 

It can be a lot of work and a long road. But it doesn't *have* to be never ending. You'll always have to keep a vigilant eye on your mental health. You'll have to learn to put yourself first. But you can achieve long periods of peacefulness. 
[deleted]
I made that realization at a really low point in my 20s. I then proceeded to make some major changes in my life that might have looked foolish on paper, but I'm actually doing a lot better now. I'm not magically better.  I still feel horrible often enough, but I've managed to carve out a life and goals that are keeping me going in a way that doesn't just feel like surviving and wasting time anymore. Obviously if you have children or a serious partner, it's harder to make some drastic changes, but so much of fighting depression is fighting bad habits and cycles that are easy to fall into and hard to climb out of. Don't be afraid of making big changes that are going to be good for you. 

A lot of what's helped me is looking for things that excite me. Get out and experience art. Let it affect you, for better or worse. Stop chasing after a state of emotion. No matter how good a balance you find, you're going to feel bad sometimes and that's okay, too. Allow yourself that, but keep trying for something better when you can. I think the hardest lesson is learning to be kind and forgiving to yourself. 
I'm depressed for no reason. I have an awesome husband and an awesome life. He allows me to be a stay at home wife, and in a few months I'll be a stay at home mom. I have my childhood pet with me in pristine health and no worries on the horizon. 

Yet I struggle with depression hard. Sometimes I do just lay in bed all day, and hope for the best. Or sometimes I just lay in bed and say fuck it. It's a struggle. Every morning I have to wake up and fight my demons. It's extremely exhausting. 

The only thing that gets me through the day sometimes is my support group: my husband (I don't have many friends). He listens when I cry and helps me with chores when I just cannot. 

The most important thing about depression is having someone to help you that *really* understands that depression isn't just "feeling down for awhile" - it's a serious daily handicap at its worst. 

Remember though that relationships go both ways. Don't just use and abuse your support group, make sure to appreciate them. When you have a good support it'll be easy to show your appreciation, too. Because you'll be genuinely grateful of their efforts. 

I hope this made sense. 
I'm 25. I was a victim of abuse and sexual molestation my entire childhood. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. It is chronic, and I take medication. Some days I forget my medication, some days the meds don't help. Some days all I want is to lay in bed and wallow. I'll forget to shower if I'm not working, realize it's 5pm and I never left bed except maybe to move to the couch in my dirty pajamas. 
I don't like to think of it as one big long ordeal. I try and take one day at a time. I try be aware of exactly how I act and why I am acting that way, especially in how I treat those I love. The worse my day is, the worse I tend to treat those around me. I have a partner who is great at pointing out when I am having a bad day and doing all he can to help. To be honest I almost think of it as a cancer. Some days will be worse than others, when treated correctly it can go into remission, but there is always a good chance that it will be back, maybe in a month, maybe a year, maybe 10 years. 

If I were to give any advice it would be this: Take it one day at a time. Be aware of how you treat others. If possible, find a good therapist or counselor. Don't be afraid to make big changes, after all, if nothing fucking matters, why be afraid?
I'm 27. Got disability last gear after over a decade of various therapies, courses, medications, and so on. I hate it. I hate myself. 


I have mostly bad days. I barely have any energy. I'm on medication that doesn't seem to work for me. I hate my life. My coping mechanism is simply reminding myself how much it would hurt my mom if I killed myself. It's kept me alive for a while now. I often wish my family told me it was okay to go, that I could end all the hurt and pain and that they would be ok. 


Not going to happen though, so I go through the days a barely functional mess. I really wish I could just kill myself and let it be over. 
I have felt like that so many times. But right now, my life couldn't be better. Depression is awful but it can be managed and you can be happy. I've actually found that my depression has been so much better as I've gotten older because I've learned how to manage it in myself better and learned to talk to people. I wish you luck. Don't give up hope.
you realize that you will have times of goodness and times of darkness.  happiness is a relative thing, it is not something you achieve and hold on to or keep.  no one does.  life is hard.  emotions ebb and flow.  you understand how your own emotions ebb and flow and you ride out the hard times, knowing that there will be times that are less hard, or even good.  

one of the hardest things i had to come to terms with was allowing myself to be happy and feel good when i was actually happy and feeling good.  don't deny yourself happiness because you spend so much time feeling sad or down.  when it comes, try to enjoy it, don't push it away.  but no one gets happy and stays that way.  

i spent way too much time hiding in my bed.  plotting ways to end my life. hating myself and everything around me.  it's too easy to get stuck there.  keep putting one foot in front of the other and take life as it comes.  there will be shit times, but allow for there to also be good times and you will get through it.
Honestly, I had to learn not to engage in depressive thoughts. Sometimes it takes just pushing yourself to do something, get out of the house, cook a meal, maybe just make some tea, anything you can physically do to get your brain out of that state. You won't think yourself out of it, because your brain is just chasing it's tail until you break the cycle. 

Then when you are feeling better about life, do the goal setting and long term planning to get more happiness into your life. Break down what happy means to you. Make lists, organize your thoughts, and start making progress on those things. Then, when you're feeling down you'll have something to look forward to.
The want will always be there. To be truly happy. This thread has a lot of good advice. What I've done though, is just forget about trying to be happy as well as forget about indulging the sad feelings. Just live your life. I feel that the more that I do that, the better my ability to cope becomes. And by normal standards I think my life has gotten significantly better.

 http://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy
I believe that no one is ever "truly happy". Even those without mental illness. Just ask yourself, what is happy?

I just want to get to a stage in life where I have some good moments. And then I want to get to a stage where the good moments feel like they are worth waiting for through all the bad moments.

I think this is possible, and that's what keeps me going.
Read Frankl.  Happiness is just one emotion.  Learn to accept all your emotions so you can enjoy the paths they take you on.  Your sufferings afford you the opportunity for a new adventure, a new meaning in life.  Sure, chronic sadness is difficult.  I won't deny that, but it's there for a reason.  Now you have the chance to be the hero in your own story and save yourself.  Just because an emotion is intense and has seemed to always have been there (or maybe it actually has always been there), doesn't mean it will always be there.  That doesn't make sense in an objective lens at all, really.  Things can and will change, whether you want them to or not.  I know that when the feelings are intense *and* chronic it seems like they never will, but, again, that is not at all a logical view.  
I hadn't realized that. Thanks allot.  

😁 Actually, I refuse to believe it! How do we know what things will come in the future?
It's all about acceptance. That also includes the fact that happiness is all an impermanent state. You cannot BE happy. You can feel it and realize it too will leave you as will sadness. The goal must be contentment in transition. The way is to focus on the now. 
recovering from depression is believing you will become better one day, Not actually getting better.  
This may sound very stupid, but I find something I'm grateful about every day and write it down. Currently, I'm doing it as a #365grateful Facebook post, but the year (my second) is almost up and I'm thinking about getting a journal specifically for it. It's really helped me see that, although I may not be happy all around, there are still things that bring me joy. This isn't a "cure," but it really has helped. 
The last sentence is what I'm wondering about. What exactly did you do with the "bleakness today". 

Its why I never understood the whole past/future thing when it comes to anxiety or depression. I mean isn't it the bleakness today which is happening right now creating those future looks bleak thoughts in the first place like you said. 
This is cool :) 
Why the oranges?
In other words what you're saying is that "isn't my life really bad - in the present times which is creating those thoughts". From what I've understood its a gray area. In my case I met a therapist and she would help me out with my problems really well. It was a slow progress. But more importantly, she helped me see areas which I had overlooked completely or helped me wrestle with the bleakness (CBT). 

I would highly recommend people who're consistently feeling low to meet with a therapist. You could also read this book "feeling good" by yourself. But simultaneously meeting with a therapist is better.

Does this correspond with rising use of ads and media content that constantly bombard us with all that is wrong in the world and with each of us personally?  
Perhaps it is because we are all so informed now. World news is instantly accessible and predominantly negative, medical mysteries unveiled (life expectancy etc), general statistics available on every area of life, and like someone said above, advertising and perfect person attitudes - mental and physical unrealistic life goals. 


I am curious about how much more honest we are answering these tests and questions? I have this feeling that we've become increasingly more open and accepting of mental health issues over the last few decades. So are we really more anxious/depressed, or are we expressing it more openly?
I would like to suggest it's many factors. Chief among them is a lack of sunlight, and a disruption of natural circadian rhythms.

We didn't evolve to be indoors most of the day, and to be under artificial light at night. It's worse now that we have bright blue-emitting LEDs in our faces all the time; blue light in certain wavelengths, abundant in our phones, monitors, etc., delay the release of melatonin and phase shift our circadian rhythms.

One theory of depression suggests a desynchronization of various internal rhythms can lead to depression. When we eat, when we sleep, when we are exposed to bright sunlight all trigger a number of different hormonal responses in every organ of our bodies.
I think widespread nutrient deficiencies are at least part of the problem. These deficiencies being the result of declining nutrient/vitamins quantities in farmed plants and animals due to increases in agricultural productivity ("productivity" being an assortment of tricks, techniques and chemicals, drugs, etc chemicals that result in a reduction of time for plants to absorb soil nutrients before harvest, chemicals for plants to grow in nutrient poor low quality soil, steroids for a reduction in time for animals to do the same through feed before slaughter, picking oranges while they're green then injecting them with CO2 gas to turn them orange, "fortifying" low nutrient food with artificially added vitamins that wont be absorbed, stuff like that.  And that's just the food that used to be nutritious; also consider the growing portion of our diets that are junk food, something that got rolling in the early 20th century with products like Twinkies and ding dongs and soda. 

Add it all up, we're not getting the nutrients our parents got, and even less than what our grandparents got. 

For instance, my anxiety has been greatly alleviated by taking magnesium aspartate (one of the causes of anxiety is a magnesium deficiency); I eat reasonably  "healthy" (plenty of greens and fruit and nuts, some chicken, non gluten carbs, rarely any processed snacks,  etc), yet I wasn't getting enough magnesium and who knows what else. 

Also, hormone disruption via various chemicals we're putting into the environment can mess with people's heads. For instance, testosterone rates in men have been declining for decades, transgenderism is increasing in the animal world in northern latitudes (and I suspect is increasing in the human population), polycystic ovary problems are increasing, and so on. When other body systems are being affected, why would our brains be immune to hormone disruptions and related chemical pollutants? 

TL;Dr - our food supply has been losing nutrient value, endocrine disruptors  in the environment are increasing, and both are probably affecting our brains, resulting in increasing brain disorders like anxiety and depression. 
It's definitely the media. We are all told constantly that the world is going to end. Y2k, global warming, terroism, trump. The media is pretty consistently fatalistic. Like this article, with all the that young americans are inundated daily, it is a miracle that there aren't more suicides and public freakouts. The rise in anxiety and depression is consistent but really not that profound. 
we're increasingly being removed from nature and put into cages. 
I believe some of the causes to be man made electromagnetic fields (EMF), lower air quality (indoor and outdoor, way too much time spent indoors ) and lower food quality filled with chemicals, junk and processed food, way too much sugar and lack of exercise.

 
Broken families.
Could be! 

My other theory is that adolescents are much more sensitive to brokenness in the societal system. 
possibly the way our youth is exposed to fantasy worlds.
f.lux for the win. If you don't use it, use it.

Our son has autism. He loves violent video games and horror movies. He idolizes school shooters such as Cho and Dylan. Whenever he hears of a school shooting, he gets a maniacal grin and says how much he wants to do it too.

He takes our dog to his room and tortures the poor animal. He points his BB gun at each of us, then at empty air, says the names of the kids at his school, and says "BANG BANG BANG".

He has knives, bats, hammers, BB guns, and axes in his room. He always talks about how when he is 18, he will get a real gun. He often picks up a knife, waves it in all our faces, and graphically describes what he wants to do to some of the kids at his school. He also takes axes and hammers and describes the places he can hit to cause the most pain.

He has the grin of a crazy maniac when he does that. And he refuses to get help, to the point that he threatens to hurt us if we talk to a psychologist.

What do we do?
If the things you say are true, then it should be obvious what you need to do. You should have already had him involuntarily committed to a mental health facility as he is clearly a danger to others. You said he tortures your dog, points guns at you, keeps multiple weapons in his room and threatens violence against classmates; this is extremely dangerous behavior for anyone. You need to call a mental health hospital and ask them how to proceed since he won't go on his own. If he threatens you with weapons, you should call the police. Your son needs obviously needs help, do not wait on this.
Parent of an autistic child here

. Take all the guns and knives!? That would be the first thing. If he flips out call the police and have him admitted. Asd or not. As that is not a mental disorder but all the rest of it could be symptoms of extreme anger and lack of coping. (Sorry if it sounds redundant) 
Get rid of the guns. Save the poor dog and temporarily rehome him. Expecting his behavior to change and giving him access to weapons is asking for something to happen. I know he is your son and you love him but this is one of those horrible tough love, for his own sake things. You have to do what it takes. Also if he is a danger to others you can have him declared medically/mentally incompetent and it will not matter when he turns 18. 
Not a medical professional but your son is a real ticking timebomb if he is actually exhibiting these behaviors as you say. He tortures animals as away to prep himself to kill and torture humans. I know nothing of autism but your son is dangerous. Remove all his weapons and get him help. Seriously.
Mental health professional here - you need to have him evaluated by a hospital ASAP. You can take him to the emergency room if he has made threats in the last 72 hours; if not, take him to a mental health hospital for adolescents and they should accept him as a walk-in. With what you have described, they can emergency detain him (court order him to treatment), but as he is under the age of 18, if they have your consent, there is no need to go through this process. If you are concerned that he would turn 18 while receiving this level of care, if he were still showing symptoms, they could transfer to an adult facility. 

Additionally, you need to remove any sharp or blunt objects from his room or from his immediate access -- yes, this means locking up kitchen knives and guns if you have them. It is also advisable that you limit access to the internet and violent video games. If what you describe is accurate, this is not something to be taken lightly and if he does take action, your negligence in this matter could make you an accessory. 

I work with teenagers in an inpatient mental health setting - I am not new to this and I can imagine the helplessness and powerlessness that you must feel. That being said, there is no excuse for sitting by and allowing threats and unsafe behavior to manifest. He may be nearing adulthood, but he is still your child and you must act now -- if not for your son, for the obligation to your family, friends, and community. 

Please feel free to PM me if you would like any additional advice or feedback on the inpatient process. The criteria vary slightly from state to state, but this sounds pretty clear cut. Best of luck - and again, I cannot stress enough the urgency of taking action in this matter. 
What ever you do, do it before he turns 18.  Once he is technically an adult, you loose the ability to have him checked in and evaluated at a mental care facility without his consent.  
I really hope this person didn't create a reddit account just to rile people up. Something smells funny about this, especially since OP has not replied.

If not, please have him legally committed to a mental health facility. I believe most states have programs designed to section dangerous people before they harm their community with sufficient evidence. Good luck. 

I feel so bad for your dog.
You say "he refuses to get help." I'm sorry, what? He's 17. Of course he's not going to "get help." He doesn't know how and would never comply even if he did. He doesn't think he needs help, everything is going fine for him. He's able to act out violently all he wants, and has no boundaries.

You need to send him to intensive inpatient care. He needs to be hospitalized, evaluated, and treated ASAP, before he turns 18 and it's too late. If you are worried they won't take it seriously, film his behaviour as evidence. Call the police to escort him to the facility to be involuntarily committed. 
Call a mental health hotline. He is 17 with autism, you speak for him. 
[deleted]
I work at a psychiatric hospital for children and adolescents that need acute care. Let me reassure you that this is (unfortunately) our normal. As painful as it will be, he needs to be admitted. While we can never promise a cure, we can promise that while he is with us he will be safe, cared for, and treated for his illness. It will be a long (likely never-ending) road. But you simply do not have the tools necessary to deal with this. He will likely be admitted for an inpatient stay of 7-14 days (on average) then enrolled in an intensive partial hospitalization program (intensive outpatient) where his moods and behavior can be monitored, and he will be re-admitted to inpatient when it is deemed necessary. 



Best of luck to you. As I said, this is our normal. You are not alone. 
This is such a troll. If it's not a troll then you should really be ashamed at yourselves for being such failures as parents. He is a danger to society. Give the dog away to a SAFE, LOVING home. Get rid of the freaking weapons. Take him to a mental institution. They will deal with him from there. If I knew you I would call the police on you and your son. 
NAMI often can be a good resource about how to set up legal custody of your child's care once he is an adult. 
Get him to a hospital now.
Get him committed asap, as much as it will hurt now it will be ten fold after he hurts himself / others.
Call 911 and have him evaluated. Do it before he turns 18 because it will be more difficult to control him. Obviously take away all the things he shouldn't have whether he has a meltdown or not. If he has a meltdown, it might be a great time to call 911. You are in over your heads and need serious professional help with him and yourselves. DO NOT WAIT.
If this is true (probably a troll) I'd have him Mentally Sectioned as soon as possible. I'd also make report to your local Police Department and include Social Services if you have one. 

But as I said, probably a troll post. 
You haven't had him committed on an involuntary hold yet? What are you waiting for?
I hope this is a troll otherwise you fucking suck as a parent.You really need to come here and ask what to do about your son who is that violent.

If this is real get him to a mental hospital ASAP 
Youre the parent. Why in the hell are you allowing him to do this? If hes hurting the dog, get the poor dog out of the fucking house and with a family who will properly care for him. Becauae you obviously cant. If youre scared of your kid then why is he allowed to have weapons in his room? Remove them. Put a lock on all weapons in the house. If he wants a gun when hes 18 tough luck. With autism and a violent personality, he wont be able to legally get one. Take him to a psych and if hes threatening you, dont make it possible for him to actually do anything (and especially dont let him have goddamn weapons in his room.) again, youre the parent. Get your shit together and use just a little bit of common sense.
Im so sorry you are going through this.  It can't be easy.  Does your county have a public mental health provider?  Many cities have a mental health crisis line that will do an emergency assessment in your home.  Does he have an intellectual disability diagnosis?  He may be eligible for a state funded group home placement.  I know Texas has some pretty good funding programs. I'm sorry to say this,  but being totally honest,  you must seek some professional help for your son or people's lives could very well be at stake.  From your son's point of view,  it is understandable to hate school because most kids are not understanding of disabilities and can be absolutely horrible to those living with them. But unless some kind of professional intervention is done,  your son's threats could come true.  Since he is threatening you,  a crisis line may be the best option.  If this isn't available in your area,  then you can call a behavioral health hospital and get their advice on the best way to  get him there.  But one thing is for sure, your son needs help now and I would do it before he turns 18. Good luck on getting through this. 
He is deeply hurting, weather he admits it or not; You NEED to TOUGHEN UP. No joke; YOU are the boss not him, make that clear to him. You will also need to get some kind of expert's help if you want to make a change.
If he is a danger to himself or others you baker act him. At best he needs therapy (maybe school has been hard for him) at worst he could hurt himself or others.

This won't go away. Help him before he does something bad if he refuses mental health help I think baker acting isn't out if the question. 
nut up.
Also you and your dog obviously need help, you're living with a violent man in your house.
How did this get so bad w/out your intervention sooner? How does a17yo with autism get guns and knives?   How are they not trained to not point?
You're 100% wrong.  You're failing to understand that some parents will blatantly  make up things about their child.

They may  have abused this kid extremely & are trying to cover it up by having him "committed"/imprisoned on false allegations.

**ie, if this kid actually did anything they should get camera proof of it and submit to police.**


Be careful though, I feel like if you take all his guns and knives away he may flip out and try to hurt you in other ways. Have a plan for when you do this.
You are assuming him guilty, with no evidence.  This parent could be highly abusive & lying.
> . I know nothing of autism but your son is dangerous.

That's the assumption of guilt.  This kid could be 100% innocent and lied about.  

If the first thing you say isn't "record it on camera and take that to the police" you are very likely helping abusive parents torture an innocent/unconvicted child without due process.
Doesn't really work that way. The only way to have him admitted against his will is to get two physicians to evaluate him and they both must independently agree that he's at risk of being harmful to society. But if he's clever enough, all he has to do is act normal and deny any threats he's made to the doctors and they'll have no reason to have him admitted. 

Another way would be if he were actively aggressive, call 911, say you have an "Emotionally Disturbed Person" (use those words exactly) and he needs to be taken to the hospital for evaluation. 
Again, the catch here is that if he calms down when police arrive, or is calm enough at the psych ER, they'll release him. 
>  do it before he turns 18. 

You're yet another person assuming this kid guilty with no evidence.

*This kid could be 100% innocent.*


It seems so obvious that doing nothing about this is a ridiculous idea that I feel like OP might just be bullshitting to upset people. It also feels like if OP has been through this sort of thing for 17 years they would have built stronger support networks than bloody reddit. Im not convinced about this post at all
I've seen behaviour like this (without guns and animals) in a friggen upscale restaurant. Kid threatened to violate his mother. For fuck's sake.
You're assuming him guilty.  Really this parent could be highly abusive & the kid could be 100% innocent.
No replies for OP, absurdly outlandish claims in the OP (axes in his room, refuses to get help yet he's 17 and doesn't have any say in the matter ffs). Called Dylan Klebold by his first name and Seung-hui Cho by his last (probably because he couldn't remember the first name). Sounds like it may very well have been written by a 17 year old that does need professional help.
No real way to tell. Just hope it is I suppose. But it might not be.
> you're living with a violent man in your house.

You don't know that.  You're assuming this kid guilty, who could be 100% innocent & the parent could be highly abusive and lying.

**This is simple:**

*If the kid actually did anything they should get camera proof of it and submit to police.*
This is why I really hope this is not a serious post...
Disregard this guy, he's an anti-mental health campaigner.
> I feel like

Complete assumption.  You're assuming him guilty.  Really this parent could be highly abusive & the kid could be 100% innocent.

As I keep saying:

- "If the first thing you say isn't 'record it on camera and take that to the police' you are very likely helping abusive parents torture an innocent/unconvicted child without due process."

May be in total denial more like it. :/ but allowing this kind of behavior and not having a clue is major neglect in any case. 


You're making a well worded argument in one direction, assuming that neither things are necessarily true, but mostly on the side of "abusive parents."

So now I'm curious what your advice would be erring on the side of "caution" and assuming that it is likely true. You keep stating the the parent could be abusive and lying. Okay, that could be true. I fucking hope not. 

Anyway, just to see what you'd say on the other side, leaning more towards, this is true, what would you say? 

"If this is true, take a video to the police." Is that all? Just wondering, man. 

And I'm going to make a crazy assumption here because sometimes when you call the police on mentally ill people, those people get shot. So you'd advocate going to the police before a mental health professional? Why is the latter worse in this scenario?

I just like seeing other sides of arguments.
Wrote a paragraph and then realized I missed yer point.
> Torture

Seriously? I've been inpatient. You get your laundry washed, your meals cooked for you, and you pad around in slippers and talk about your feelings and draw pictures of your inner child. No one is being tortured. 
I realize it's not that simple.  However it really doesn't matter what you tell them when you call 911, if when they arrive he is acting in a calm rational manner and there is no evidence of physical violence. They can't even force him to go to a hotel for the night; because the house is his permanent residence they need more then the parents word that he is a danger. 
He's autistic, its unlikely he'll be able to obfuscate that effectively.
> he's at risk of being harmful to society. 

I can tell from your language that you are assuming him guilty, with no evidence.
In reality, *this kid could be 100% innocent and lied about.*
There is no guilt or innocence here. This is not a trial. This is a sub about mental healthcare and this person is exhibiting symptoms and we are recommending treatment, not a sentence. If he's perfectly fine, it will show up in the evaluation. 
> He takes our dog to his room and tortures the poor animal. He points his BB gun at each of us, then at empty air, says the names of the kids at his school, and says "BANG BANG BANG".

sounds like a delightful young whippersnapper


You've said this at least twice, I am wondering why. 

Mental illness isn't a crime, so it's not a matter of guilt or innocence. 
That's stupid. Clearly I'm going to assume the OP is being honest and advise her accordingly, because otherwise what's the point of this interaction? 

You give whatever advice you like. I'm going to give the advice that I feel is best for this situation.  
Sadly some people still lock their mentally ill relatives in a back room and do nothing.   That could be the case here. 
> [ad hominem fallacy]

I'm against violently attacking innocent/unconvicted people.  (There should be due process where there must be evidence/conviction & a victim before people are put in prisons.)

And saying that's not an argument that anything I've said is wrong.
Why are you convinced this kid is being set up by evil parents? I don't get it. 

In all advice-giving things on here, we are listening to OP and giving advice based on the assumption that what they say is true. Why, in this case, are you convinced it is not true? 
> "If this is true, take a video to the police." Is that all? Just wondering, man. 

There's a big difference between:

- Saying you have a video and want charges brought 

- And wildly calling the police and claiming someone is evil/dangerous.  

I'm advocating the former.  The former gives the person a chance for due process.

>  here because sometimes when you call the police on mentally ill people, those people get shot. 

You mean people *accused* of "mental illness."  And you almost surely mean in the USA, where the police kill just about anyone they want, not just people accused of "mental illness."

Really there aren't physically "mentally ill" people- such is just a label for alleged feels/behaviors & it's "diagnosed" based on subjective opinions.

> "psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests"

-- Allen Frances, 2013


Whoa whoa whoa there buddy, did you even read that entire sentence?

I said that IF doctors evaluate him and FIND that he's a risk to society THEN they can have him admitted to a psychiatric hospital. I never said anyone was guilty. 
>  and this person is exhibiting symptoms 

That's assuming guilt.  The fact that you assume guilt without saying the word, without any debate over whether the victim did anything, only shows your dishonesty.

>  If he's perfectly fine

That's subjective opinion, not evidence/conviction of any crime.  That's also the assumption of guilt. 

And it's no excuse- the violence/torture has already been started because of the kidnapping & imprisonment of innocent/unconvicted people, who are assumed guilty, called "evaluation."
You're assuming someone guilty without evidence/conviction of any crime.  People lie, especially abusive parents.  You can not just guess whether the kid is evil or the parents are.  
When people are put in psychiatric prisons they are often accused of something bad or illegal, but just assumed guilty with no evidence/conviction.

It *is* a matter of guilt or innocence.

And "mental illness" is not a real/physical illness, but a label for alleged behaviors/feelings.

The point should be to be rational, eg explaining that we have to base our beliefs on evidence & thus gather evidence for our assertions.

Not use rape-like violence & torture against innocent/unconvicted kids.

And such assumptions of guilt are irrational no matter how evil the parent makes them sound.  Abusive parents do that to cover up their abuse.
> violently attacking

haha
> Why are you convinced 

I didn't say that.  I'm not assuming either side is guilty.

The solution is having an evidence/conviction based system.  ie, a trial.

If you're assuming one side's accusations to be true you're not being rational.

Yeah, okay. Tell that to my bipolar diagnosis, I'd love for it to be made up and to not have to take pills to function like a normal human being. 
>  IF doctors evaluate

So-called "evaluation" itself *is* violently kidnapping the person, violently taking their cloth, violently treating them like an animal, & so on.  And you can tell the person has already been assumed guilty because violence was used to kidnap/imprison them.

> and FIND that he's a risk to society 

Again, that's subjective opinion & not evidence/conviction of any crime.  The real risk to the innocent is psychiatric violence/torture.  It's psychiatrists who are dangerous to others, not innocent/unconvicted people.


Omg what are you taking mock trials in middle school and really excited about your new vocabulary?

Because you clearly understand nothing about how reddit works, or how mental healthcare works, or anything about parenting, or talking to other people in a casual, online context. 

Maybe you should sit back and read a little. You've completely hijacked this thread repeating the same thing over and over and over and contributing nothing beyond "film it so you have evidence" which, again, others have already said (including me!) long before you got here.

Lay off the sunkist and go back to your algebra homework. 


A mental health check up will determine the kids status. If the parent is trying to pull something, that will come out as well. I am taking the request for help at face value. 

This is not treated the same as it once was, in the past someone could just "say" a person was mentally ill and off they go to the nut barn. Today it is not that easy. 

It is better to get him to a mental health specialist and be ruled mentally health, than to ignore this and see a list of victims on the news. 

Your take on this is rather odd. No one is trying to have the kid arrested, nor is anyone pretending he's a criminal. Mental heath is nothing to play with, I know I'm bi-polar. 
Funnily enough we're not in a court. Saying someone pointed a gun at you isn't an opinion, it's a statement. Whether we know it to be factual or not is irrelevant because ultimately we have no say in the outcome. The idea of giving someone advice on a matter like this is to give suggestions in the instance that they're right. If they're not right then the suggestions are worthless anyway.

Now if the acts described in this post were more along the lines of "we think our son is going to shoot up his school because he listens to metal music", then there'd be the potential for dissenting opinions against the poster. However, the way this post was written can only indicate two things; either OP is telling the truth and genuinely needs advice, or OP is lying in which case the advice wouldn't even be relevant. 
Where do you live? In the US, we have few - if any - mental institutions. We lock our mentals up in real jail, if possible we shoot them. Some lucky ones get into half-way houses. Seriously, no one will say it that way, but it is what it is.

I am bi-polar, it is what it is. I don't scream at people, I don't hurt anyone, I'm just bi-polar. It's a mental illness. You can deny it all you want, I live it so I don't care if you believe in it. 

The brain is a complex organ, we learn more about it every day. When something is misfiring in the brain (mental), it's an illness that needs to be treated. 

Don't try to prove to me mental illness doesn't exist. Prove to me that I don't have what I live every day. 
> Not use rape-like violence & torture against innocent/unconvicted kids.

Um, what? We're suggesting medical care, which a person who is acting this way clearly needs. This is a public conversation - its doesn't matter if the OP is completely making it up and is actually a 12 yr old girl typing it. It's my responsibility to give sound advice in case anyone out this is actually in this situation, whether or not the OP is. And, in fact, I did, in a different part of this thread.



Were your parents abusive? I don't know how you came to that conclusion reading this particular post. I'm wondering if you've had a very similar story told about you by abusive parents. You clearly don't have to answer that, but if you're projecting these things, it's clearly an issue for you. I hope that you're in therapy if any of this I said is correct. I would just think that your response is so strangely specific and something that most people wouldn't have even touched on, that maybe it's an issue. Abused children need help as adults as well. 

I'm not trying to be an asshole. I'm actually concerned. It seems like this topic is somehow very personal to you.
ALL of the "advice" on reddit comes from a basic assumption that OP is telling the truth. Everyone commenting saying "You should have them committed" is beginning with the typical assumption that OP is not lying. 

Obviously, if OP is lying, the advice would be different. However, assuming OP is lying is counter-productive. Modifying every advice post based on the possibility of OP lying is just not realistic. 

So I ask again, why do you think we need to consider the possibility of OP lying in this instance? 
There is no need for a trial on a freaking advice thread. Good gods.
I ran into this guy in a thread a few days ago.  Trust me when I say he's pathological (just check his comment history).

Arguing with him is like screaming into the void.  
> and to not have to take pills to function like a normal human being. 

Even if that's true, no behavior, feeling, or misbehavior is a physical illness: there is nothing to examine.  Physical illnesses have physical damage (ie physical units of measurement) or physical loss of function.

Even if you *were* born different:

1. Different != a disease.

2. Different != inferior.  If the world that "normal people" accept doesn't fit you, that may be because the world is messed up.  Not you.

> , in the past someone could just "say" a person was mentally ill and off they go to the nut barn. 

That's still how it works, except the allegation must be that the person is "dangerous."  If the psychiatrists want they can just assume that with no evidence/conviction & put some innocent person in one of their "hospitals"/prisons for life, which is really more like a death camp- it's a way to violently get rid of people.  To fully humiliate & destroy them in one of the most cruel ways possible, all with no evidence/conviction of any crime.

That's another assumption of guilt.  And there's already many millions of people who have lost their lives to psychiatrists.  Eliminating that torture & mass murder (via life prison sentences) should be the primary goal.


> Whether we know it to be factual or not is irrelevant because ultimately we have no say in the outcome.

Wrong.  If you tell a lying abusive parent how to torture their kid in a prison you are contributing to the outcome.

I am not saying this person is abusive- I don't know.

> . Saying someone pointed a gun at you isn't an opinion

It is actually, but more importantly, it's an accusation that can be false, & can be a blatant lie.


>  In the US, we have few - if any - mental institutions. 

That's not true.  There are 406 large state level (non-federal) prisons called "mental institutions."  Plus federal ones, and more importantly, practically all major hospitals have a prison for innocent/unconvicted people they'll call a "psych ward"/"mental hospital."  

It's big business: they charge insurers, the state, & even their victims, making lots of money imprisoning innocent/unconvicted people.

And it's highly unfair language to call these prisons anything but that- prisons.  

> We lock our mentals 

Physically there's no "mentals."  It's a subjective opinion.  eg from the perspective of the very poor the "mentals" could be the police, the rulers, & state oppression generally.

>  When something is misfiring in the brain

There's no evidence that what's called "mental illness" is "misfirings in the brain." 

Similarly, there's no evidence for the "chemical imbalance" theory either:

-- psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/couch-crisis/psychiatry%E2%80%99s-new-brain-mind-and-legend-%E2%80%9Cchemical-imbalance%E2%80%9D 

As I said earlier:

 - I didn't say anyone was faking any behaviors, feelings, or suffering.  I quoted Allen Frances- *he said* that what we call "mental illness" was a "made up" "construct."  In other words labels.

  Allen Frances *was the chairman in charge of creating the DSM-IV.*

  He wasn't just there, he was in charge of making up this stuff.  He helped personally make up the modern idea of "bipolar" & has said he regretted his changes to the definition.

  He's also said:

>  We're suggesting medical care,

No, you're lying by calling violent kidnapping, violent cloth taking, etc "medical care" to disguise what is really an assumption of guilty without evidence/conviction. 

(Without due process.)

Your "reasoning" is "someone was accused of something bad, therefore they're guilty."

And that's not rational.

> It's my responsibility to give sound advice

Assuming kids guilty and helping their parents violently torture them is not "giving sound advice."

> [personal attacks]

The topic is assuming someone guilty without evidence (a logical fallacy), and talking about me personally is not an argument that such is not a logical fallacy.
It's like he's never been on reddit before.
> ALL of the "advice" on reddit comes from a basic assumption that OP is telling the truth.

That's irrational.  If you guess wrong you're giving a violent abuser help in abusing their child.

> So I ask again, why do you think we need to consider the possibility of OP lying in this instance? 

1. Because I'm rational.

2. Because you could be hurting some innocent child.  I know you couldn't care less about this.


You're misreading.  If some child is accused of violence/etc they should get a trial in a court room.

People in this thread are advocating violence/torture of a child (eg kidnapping, rape-like clothing taking, imprisonment) based purely on the assumption of guilt.
Ha! I did go through his history prior to engaging him. As childish as this is, I'm bored and it's entertaining. Eventually I'll stop. I know I won't change his mind, I don't care lol. It's just fun. 
ooohhhh... you're one of those. 

Welp, whether my symptoms are measurable on some kind of scientific scale or not (they truly aren't, psychology is an imperfect and underdeveloped science) I know what happens to me without my medication. I don't care about the label, we are treating a life threatening issue that I have. I've been hospitalized! Was the best decision of my life.

And I'm happy! Meds got shit under control, the people around me aren't suffering, I'm not suffering, and I get to participate in normal life shit that I couldn't previously hack. It's a miracle, in my mind. I know many others feel the same way I do. 

I'm aware that physical pain is measurable, testable, and that the results are mostly reliable. You aren't telling me anything I don't know. 

We DID decide what constitutes "abnormal," and while it may be some kind of seemingly arbitrary scale to you, generally the idea is that if something severely interferes with your day to day living, it's then considered a PROBLEM. If you are in danger of hurting others, that is a PROBLEM. You don't have to name it! We can just call them "problems," if that makes you feel better.

They exist. Maybe I'm not abnormal, and honestly, I don't give a shit.

I want to thrive. And I am! :)
> [personal attacks]

That is not an argument that I'm wrong.
I say this with love. TAKE YOUR MEDS.

If I had ones that worked you can bet your ass I'd be on them!
Again, why the strong reaction? I'm seriously more interested in the answer to that question. What is your stake in this game? 

The paragraph with the word "mental" was tongue in cheek. 
Seriously, what are you talking about, because I think we are having a completely different conversation. This person claims to be afraid of her 17 year old son because he is acting out violently. We are recommending that she take him to receive in-patient psychiatric care in a medical residential medical facility. And if necessary, she may need to have the police assist her. This is a perfectly reasonable thing to suggest. There is no way for me to request verification of any of these claims without compromising the OP's anonymity and therefore I am obliged to simply take her claims at face-value, and give advice,  or leave the thread. 

Also - there is no "due process" here. We are strangers on the internet. I'm not passing any kind of judgement, I am not the jury, judge, case-worker, lawyer, doctor, or nurse here. What I say right now has no bearing on what any of those people will decide is right or wrong in this case. I am addressing an individual poster, taking her claims at face value, and giving advice based on that.

It's like you've literally never been in a thread on reddit asking for advice about relationships or mental health or anything. 

Besides, no one is saying he's "guilty" of anything. We are all here in this thread agreeing that the symptoms presented are troubling and require attention. If the entire story is fabricated, that will be evident. 

If you think she's making it up, then tell her that. Stop policing perfectly reasonable comments. 


It was not a personal attack. Very personal question, but in no way an attack. The way people's minds work fascinates me. I was just asking about yours.
How is it irrational to assume truth? It's one of the basics in human communication: you assume the other person isn't deliberately misleading you. 

Let's think about it in another context. Say I post saying "I had a fight with my husband and he threatened to shoot me. What should I do?". The people responding don't say "You might be lying and trying to make your poor husband look bad", they say "get out of there before he shoots you". 

How is it hurting an innocent child to say "when your child is threatening people and hoarding weapons and fantasising about murdering others, you should have them committed" ? 

Even if OP was making it up, how does telling him to find help hurt the child? If he was trying to lie and hurt this child, surely he would do that regardless of what reddit says? 

Honestly, the only way you could read this story and think "responding to this will result in a child being hurt" is if you are reading something into it that just isn't there. 
No. A child should definitely NOT be put on trial in a courtroom. The should be approached with love and with professional care to help them. A trial is about establishing guilt. There is NO guilt with mental illness. There is only wellness and unwellness. You don't put children on trial for crimes, you guide them to better behaviour with therapy and medication. Clearly you are not a parent. 

Once again, where are these specific terms coming from, and what does that have to do with inpatient psychiatric care? 

> kidnapping

Having an officer escort the child in your custody to a facility to hand over custody to them is not kidnapping. Kidnapping of a child is when you unlawfully take a child away from the custody of the parent without permission.

> rape-like clothing taking


At what point do you imagine someone forcefully removing this 17 year old mans clothes? You wear your own clothes in a psych hospital, for the most part. Did you know that? You just aren't allowed belts or shoe laces or anything sharp.

Second of all - calling being disrobed against your will "rape-like" is really problematic. Having someone strip your clothes from you could constitute assault, but it's not rape. They are not the same thing. Not even close to the same thing.

> imprisonment

Seriously? He's 17. His parents still have the right to ground him *for no reason at all* because they are his parents. They just aren't able to because he has weapons. 
I watched him argue over semantics for about 6 hours yesterday, the day before that I briefly engaged him over the assertion that "mental illness isn't real" before I realized what I was dealing with.

I'm pretty sure there's enough material for a psychology case study buried in his comment history, which I think is ironic given his chosen crusade.
> We DID decide what constitutes "abnormal," 

If being abnormal was "mental illness" then gays and all sorts of other clear minority groups would be "mentally ill."

That's not accurate.

>  the idea is that if something severely interferes with your day to day living, 

That's subjective opinion, not an illness.

> I know what happens to me without my medication

Your drugs.  Drugs are great, but they're not "medicine" just because the state sells them with that language.

There's no "mind illness" & thus the medical language is false.  There's no "patients" & so on.

Basically people are taught "drugs are bad," but then told to use the state's drugs.

Thus the myth is created that the state's drugs are "medicine."

It's all pseudo-medical language.
>  We are recommending that she take him to receive in-patient psychiatric care in a medical residential medical facility. 

You're using circular reasoning.  You are asserting that violent kidnapping, rape-like clothing taking, imprisonment & assumptions of guilt are "health care" and "medical" without evidence.

ie, you're asserting it's true because you assert it's true.  (Circular reasoning.)

The truth is it's dishonest Orwellian language.

>  There is no way for me to request verification of any of these claims without compromising the OP's anonymity and therefore I am obliged to simply take her claims at face-value

No, that's irrational.  That's assuming guilt.  Believing without evidence is a logical fallacy.

> Besides, no one is saying he's "guilty" 

That's how this violent quackery works- the victim is assumed guilty without any evidence, and thus no trial where whether guilt is attempted to be shown.

And you can tell there's the assumption of guilt (despite people not saying it) because of the constant recommendations to violently attack the child.

> How is it irrational to assume?

It's a logical fallacy. 

>  how does telling him to find help

It's not "help" to violently attack & kidnap an innocent/unconvicted child with rape-like violence.

>  It's one of the basics in human communication: you assume the other person isn't deliberately misleading you. 

No, & *especially* not when the topic is violently attacking & torturing an innocent/unconvicted child.

Abusive parents demonize their kids.  They make up stuff to make it sound like the kid is the evil one, not them, thus justifying their violence/abuse/etc.

>  "when your child is threatening people 

That's assuming guilt & advocating violence towards an innocent/unconvicted child.


> > imprisonment

> Seriously? He's 17. 

Being 17 is not an argument that a prisoner is not in a prison.

- "Prison. A place or condition of confinement or forcible restraint."   

-- thefreedictionary.com/prison   

> A child should definitely NOT be [given due process, let's just assume they're guilty & violently attack them]

FTFY.  That's not honest.

>  The should be approached with love and with professional care to help them.

Violent kidnapping & torture by pseudo-medical quacks is not "loving" or "care."  

It's an industry where parents can pay to have their children tortured & all that's required is a few false allegations.

>  with inpatient psychiatric care? 

There are no patients- there's just prisoners of torturer quacks.  There's no "psychiatric care."

> Having an officer escort the child in your custody to a facility to hand over custody to them is not kidnapping. 

You're being dishonest.  From the perspective of an innocent/unconvicted child pleading innocence it's obvious violent kidnapping.  They are not a slave with no human rights, no matter what psychiatrists believe.

> calling being disrobed against your will "rape-like" is really problematic. 

More dishonesty.


> I'm pretty sure there's enough material for a psychology case study buried in his comment history, which I think is ironic given his chosen crusade.

I was seriously thinking this as well, reading that stuff. Or just noting that he repeatedly brought up the "abusive parents" thing here got me thinking about that. I hope he's okay, really. Now I'm afraid that I'm having some lulz over a mentally ill person and that's not really okay...

Sigh. I'm done. I'll tag him though to see future shit storms.

> That's not accurate.

It is accurate and homosexuality used to be considered a mental illness.

> That's subjective opinion, not an illness.

I dont' care what you want to call it. From my own standpoint (subjectively, that is) I had a "problem' <---remember? We're calling them "problems" now just to make this go a little more smoothly? Anyway, my problem sucked ass. Well, duh I wanted help for my problem. I got help for my problem! Drinks all around! Well, not for me because drinking actually just causes me to accumulate new problems. But I'll buy yours :)

They are indeed drugs! Yes, that is also correct! I love my drugs. Now, that being said, it's not like they get me high. They just make me feel like what I'd assume a "normal" person might feel. When I say "normal," I mean someone whose brain doesn't, for lack of a better phrase- produce its own cocaine and make me high on it repeatedly. NOT as fun as it sounds. Oh, and then the fact that my brain also decides we're pretending I took enough downers to tranquilize someone, but not quite enough that they aren't a bit sad and thinking of shooting themselves.

So, that was before my wonderful drugs, for my problem. I hated my problem. I love my drugs because they help my problem quite a lot! I've tried black market drugs. Weed makes me paranoid, heroin would cause just as many issues as my "problem" and cocaine just makes the happy part of my "problem" worse! And I've tried NO drugs! Boy, let me tell you! I was NOT a happy camper. And no one around me was either! Suddenly, my "problems" became a burden to other people! These people were happy to see me get my "problems" under control, and they are happy that I'm on drugs as well.

I don't have to be a patient! Let's not even call me one anymore, for the sake of this argument! I'm a "client." How about that? I like that. Why, I use it for people I see in the community who have "problems" sometimes too! 

So there we go, buddy! I think we've settled this. 

You think mental illness don't real, I have one, it sucks. You didn't offend me. I'm pretty sure you have your own "problem." Take care. If you ever need drugs for your "problem," try to become a "client" at a good establishment that is not the black market. Drugs are expensive in either place though. And it might take time for you to find a drug that works for your "problem." Do not get discouraged. Also, if you don't want to take drugs for your "problem," that's fine too! Hopefully your family is also okay with that decision. 


> You're using circular reasoning. You are asserting that violent kidnapping, rape-like clothing taking, imprisonment & assumptions of guilt are "health care" and "medical" without evidence.

Where are you getting that description of what it's like to be in a residential mental healthcare facility? Seriously. Where is that coming from?

Because I've been in several. I know many people who have been in many other facilities. This is not what happens. 

> That's assuming guilt. 

There is no guilt. There is only unwellness here that, if the OP is being truthful, requires care. 

> this violent quackery 

What violent quackery? Seriously? What are you talking about? Who is attacking someone. We're talking about moving him to an inpatient facility for intensive therapy and monitored medication. We're not talking about Arkham. 

You are starting from the position that OP is abusive, and I am starting from the position that we should take OP's words at face value. 

I don't think we will reach a consensus. 

I would suggest, however, that assuming someone is abusive when they ask for help with a problem is perhaps not the most empathetic response. Have you considered that your response is based on false prejudice, rather than on the story as it is presented here? 
You clearly don't really understand the basic purpose of having a conversation like this, maybe you should let it go. We're not establishing truth, we're giving advice, none of which will harm anyone, though you seem to think so. 
FINALLY! It's revealed. You are actually opposed to psychiatric care entirely. Ok then. What are you doing in this sub? I think it's probably time for you to leave. 
> I hope he's okay, really.

Same.  He's insufferable in his attitude, but I really get the sense he's arguing with himself instead of the people he's replying too.  
> It is accurate and homosexuality used to be considered a mental illness.

In other words, you believe "abnormal is mental illness" & thus you believe gays are mentally ill, correct?

That's of course irrationally pseudo-science bigotry.

> "problems"

You gave a long rant about "drugs" and "problems", but as long as you aren't using pseudo-medical language there's nothing I disagree with.

> You think mental illness don't real

I didn't say anyone was faking any behaviors, feelings, or suffering.  I quoted Allen Frances- *he said* that what we call "mental illness" was a "made up" "construct."  In other words labels.

The dude with whom you're debating sounds more like they're arguing the validity and quality of psychiatric care than it does whether or not the kid needs help.
> You are starting from the position that OP is abusive

Wrong.  I am not assuming they are or aren't.  Unless there is a trial with evidence/conviction (eg a camera recording) you can't know.

> and I am starting from the position that we should take OP's words at face value. 

That's irrational.  It's a logical fallacy.

As far as you know this person wants "help" increasing the violent abuse of their child.  You have no idea.
> we're giving advice, none of which will harm anyone, 

Actually you are advocating violence/kidnapping of a child with no evidence/conviction (no due process) because you're irrationally assuming them guilty of accusations.  

>  the basic purpose of having a conversation like this

No no- I *disagree* with your idea of assuming people guilty.  I debunked it.

He's an obvious troll who's bait game isn't even that good but you guys are falling all over yourselves to eat it up. I guess we don't have very active mods here to ban him so please just stop responding.
> You are actually opposed to psychiatric care entirely.

There is no such thing.  Violent kidnapping/etc is torture, not health care.  And it does not help "mental health."

eg, [how being kidnapped/tortured by psychiatrists increases suicide rates.](http://www.alternet.org/personal-health/research-suggests-psychiatric-interventions-admission-mental-facility-could-increase)  They're literally torturing people to death.

This sub should be about educating about various issues relating to the mind, not for psychiatrist's advertising their "services"/quackery.  



I really think you're right. Many people think that mental illness isn't real, but the way he's just ALWAYS on this makes it seem like he's in denial about some shit of his own. 
Are you some kind of activist (should I even call it that) in this area? I can't help but assume that your angle is that people get labeled with things that they don't even have and that this could be very harmful to them. And I agree with that. There is no reason a person who doesn't need drugs for treatment should be taking them at all. It could do damage. This is a problem. There have been "flavor of the week" diagnoses for years.

Other than that, I can't see what you are arguing other than semantics. 

My issues with your rant is that you MAY be discouraging people from seeking help for problems. Because it took me until THIS post of yours to realize that, if you take out all the minutiae and then put it in better terms- to realize that you aren't denying that these are problems that can often, and should often be addressed with drugs.

It looked like you were arguing against the concept as a whole. You could save a LOT of time if you stopped trying to prove yourself so smart, and well read on sources and just prefaced everything with "look, I believe that these are real problems for many people and that they definitely should be addressed in many cases. However, I find the wording used for them in this country to be inaccurate from a medical/scientific standpoint." Or some shit. Smart that up and put it before all your rants. And then maybe people would be a bit more receptive to your ideas. That's assuming that you're trying to accomplish anything here.

Because you really didn't say anything I have not, at one time or another, heard or read. You just came off more like "Pffft, that doesn't exist!" rather than "Yeah, it exists, it just irks me the way they word it."


It's.... so confusing. He appears to be completely unable to understand the purpose of this discourse. And also seems to have no idea what in-patient psychiatric care entails. There is a lot of pudding. It's really not that bad. 
Okay, let me rephrase that: 

You are starting from the position that OP is *potentially* abusive. 

I am starting from the position that we should take OP's words at face value. 

>That's irrational. It's a logical fallacy.

It is not a logical fallacy to assume someone is telling me the truth. It is an assumption, as is often made in various modes of communication, in order to facilitate discussion. I do not think it is illogical to make this assumption. 

It's the same thing we do to speak to each other here: you assume I'm not making up everything I say, and are taking what I say at face value. I believe we should extend that courtesy to OP. 
I have. I also reported him. But there is a certain amount of fun in it, for me.
From the study: if someone had actually been admitted to a psychiatric hospital, they were 44.3 times more likely to have commited suicide within the year.

This is because of their mental illness. People who are more likely to commit suicide are more likely to have a severe mental illness which requires psychiatric care. Now please stop trolling this sub.
> You are starting from the position that OP is potentially 

"Potentially abusive" could include anyone, it's meaningless.  Both sides are "potentially abusive".

Without evidence, eg video recordings, you simply don't know & are assuming.

> I am starting from the position that we should take OP's words at face value. 

That's still irrational.  It's a logical fallacy to believe something without evidence.

It's not honest.
> This is because of their mental illness. 

That's just an assumption, & an irrational assumption- millions of people outside of these prisons/"hospitals" were also labeled with the term "mental illness" & depression, but [the massively higher suicide rate](http://www.alternet.org/personal-health/research-suggests-psychiatric-interventions-admission-mental-facility-could-increase) wasn't for them, it was specifically for the innocent/unconvicted people who were treated like animals, violently kidnapped with rape-like violence & cloth taking, & violently kept as prisoners with no due process.  (Evidence/conviction of a crime.)

These people are essentially tortured to death- they are tortured so severely that they no longer want to live.

The truth is what's called "mental illness" is a label for alleged suffering, behaviors, & feelings.  That suffering can be a big deal & drugs can be the solution.  But the key here is that people don't physically "have it" but are just labeled.  *ie, it's not even physically possible to blame suicides of psychiatric torture victims on it.*

As I said earlier:

 - I didn't say anyone was faking any behaviors, feelings, or suffering.  I quoted Allen Frances- *he said* that what we call "mental illness" was a "made up" "construct."  In other words labels.

> which requires psychiatric care.

There was no so-called "psychiatric care."  Violently kidnapping innocent people with rape-like violence is not "care," "health care", etc.  What it is, is a massively profitable industry as people's insurance & the state would be billed.



> [personal attacks]

That's not an argument that anything I said was wrong.



>Without evidence, eg video recordings, you simply don't know & are assuming.

Exactly, that is my point. I think we SHOULD assume. You believe we should NOT assume, which is why we will not reach a consensus. 

>It's a logical fallacy to believe something without evidence.

I'm not sure you understand what a logical fallacy is. Regardless, it's not illogical. We have to start with some base assumptions or we never manage to communicate with anyone. 

>  I think we SHOULD assume. 

ie, you blatantly endorse irrationality & logical fallacies.  And thus you don't care if you help an innocent/unconvicted child get tortured with rape like kidnapping, cloth taking, etc.

You destroy their life, and don't care at all.  You are without empathy.

>> It's a logical fallacy to believe something without evidence.

The irony.  I'll be very clear: you're practicing circular reasoning.

Assuming something true is "I believe X is true because I believe X is true."

Similar to "the bible is true because the bible is true."


Oh, I see, you think my statement of opinion is actually my reasoning for the opinion. No, I'm just restating it.

Let me be very clear in return :) 

My reason to assume he is telling the truth is this: 

When we talk to someone, we assume they speak the truth, otherwise we can not communicate with them. It is literally impossible. For example, you ASSUME I am truthfully stating my opinions in this thread. You ASSUME that I type my sentences with the intention to convey my opinion. You ASSUME that when I state "I think ____" I am telling the truth. 

The above paragraph is stating a fact, then giving some examples. The fact is a known rule of how communication between humans works. If you disagree with this fact, please disagree with specific points in it, rather than telling me it is a logical fallacy. 

Now, if you DO agree with the above fact: 

My assumption about OP is exactly the same. When he types his post, I ASSUME he is stating something he believes is true, because it facilitates communication. 

Because of my assumption, I respond to what he has stated as though it is true. 

If I did not assume such a thing, there would be no point attempting to communicate with OP at all. 

This leads me back to my initial question: Why do you think OP's words are possibly a lie? Why question his words, specifically, and no one elses?

> , otherwise we can not communicate with them. It is literally impossible

Wrong.  You can say "If this is true you should get it on camera and try to get the police to press charges."  No assumption of guilt is needed.

>  is actually my reasoning for the opinion. No, I'm just restating it.

That's circular reasoning.  Your belief is something is true because you believe it's true.  Just like "the bible is true because it's true."

ie, you are openly endorsing irrationality.  

I address your concerns, but you don't address mine. 

I don't think I have anything else to say to you unless you are willing to attempt to read what I say and actually respond to it. 

Oh.. This hit home. 
Solemn and beautiful.
Powerful
gobsmacked 

heh ... friends
Must be nice
so painful and so true

So let me get this straight....  You can be "seeking" medical care and already have a "diagnosis"?   The social & political diagnosis comes before the medical one?  
Um, Houston we have a problem.  
This article is a bunch of crap. Sure, maybe some people are partially driven because of misogyny or racism. But if you're willing to go into a crowded area, unprovoked, and intend to kill a large number of people, you have a mental illness. Most likely that illness is antisocial personality, but there are other options as well. But you have a brain issue if that's the way you decided to handle some sort of perceived problem.  

Source: I'm a mental health professional. 

Perhaps I'm reading the article wrong, but it reads to me as the author is negating mental illness, for the most part. Which is just as much of a problem as if people are actually trying to down play some form of bigotry as a factor. But there are many instances of mass mourner that do not seem to involve misogyny or racism. 

I agree that the stigma is intensified as a result of these kinds of things, but there's a huge range of severity when it comes to mental illness, just as there is for cancer, heart disease, influenza, etc. But the fact that it makes stigma worse is no reason to deny that those who commit mass murder have a mental illness, as well. 
So they shoot people because they're mentally unwell, and you know they're mentally unwell because they shoot people?

He's just being nice. Jeez.
I take a dose of Lil B every morning, it's done wonders for my psychosis.
> Well, guess there's no need for the anti-depressants then!

I honestly don't think he said it that way. I don't know who "Lil'B" is apart from the obvious fact that he's a rapper. But I think there's true sentiment behind what he's written. I think this is about as close as it gets to a "gangster rapper" admitting he has suffered depression before to some extent, and that's his way of relating it.

If he's well off, I hope he one day considers donating to mental health research.
I just want to correct you on that. Rappers have been confessing to suicidal thoughts and depression (some of it clinical some of it not) for quite a while now. http://rollingout.com/music/aap-rocky-opens-up-about-suicidal-thoughts-and-depression/ David Banner is another example. Emo rap has also been a rising subgenre in the past two decades. 
What essentially happens is that everytime I smell cigarette smoke I basically get triggered and start crying and have to leave the area immediately or else I start to rage. The problem is, my parents are both smokers. 

I hide in my room with a towel under the door whenever they are home so that smoke doesn't get inside.

Sometimes, my mom will come inside my room and then my room smells like smoke. It's extremely hard to get rid of the smell from my room which is why I try so hard to keep it out in the first place 

Today I started getting upset for that reason and she said to stop, and I told her I could not stop because I can't help it 

Today she got in my face and was yelling at me defending herself for smoking saying it's not bad or whatever, but while she was yelling at me more smoke came into my room and I was starting to get into the stage where I'm starting to rage and I'm SQUEEZING my hands running them through my hair trying to control myself


I've begged them for years to quit smoking. They don't understand that smoking is my MAIN trigger. They tell my to stop "laying around" all day and do something but I literally cannot leave my room because when I smell cigarette smoke I also get suicidal thoughts. 

**because I am undiagnosed I am not sure if it is OCD or something else, but I had to do my own research because I know something isn't right.

[deleted]
I'm sorry that she's doing that to you. I don't know if you have your own source of income, but something you might try is buying a pet odor candle. I know, it sounds way out of left field but they wipe the smell out of any room and replace it with the pleasant one, it cost me $8. Also, I used to live with smokers and that kind of helped with the smoky air, that and my handy dandy humidifier. 
If you're still in public school you can ask a teacher/counselor you trust for help getting a diagnosis, or at least finding a professional to talk to. 

I don't think it's normal to get yelled at for not liking cigarette smoke, especially by one of your parents. I used to be a smoker and I don't even like the smell! 
I'm so sorry. I am in / have been in the exact situation. My parents are terrible.
Some people may tell you to get out as soon as you can, but, this is NOT easy. Think about yourself and your health first. Is keeping to your point worth the harassment from them? It feels degrading and awful but it is for survival. There are tactics to try to tip toe around these situations, being homeless or an orphan may or may not be better. If you want any more advice feel free to comment or message me anytime. Also, check out /r/raisedbynarcissicts  ( I can't spell )
​If your parents refuse to take you to the doctor you have certain rights even as a minor. I pulled this from a quick google search.  It will definitely change state to state. I would call a general practitioner in your area tell them your situation and see what they say. Out of pocket payment for a doctors appointment is $75 where I'm at so not terribly unaffordable. Tell them your financial situation as well and you may find a nice doctor that will work with you on payment. 


Generally, only persons age 18 and over can give consent to their own routine medical and dental care. Youth under 18 need the consent of a parent or legal guardian to receive medical care. There are some exceptional circumstances in which youth under 18 can be treated without parental consent. For example, most states allow minors to consent to treatment in limited circumstances, such as:
• Emergency treatment of life-threatening conditions;
• Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (minors above a certain age);
• Treatment related to a pregnancy;
• Drug or alcohol treatment (minors above a certain age); and
• Mental health treatment (minors above a certain age).


Jesus, that's so disrespectful. I'm a smoker but I would NEVER smoke in the same room as my brother (who also hates smoking) nor would I let the smoke/smell in his room. (Then again, I stopped tobacco about a month ago, I do vapes now which smell nice and dissipate from the air in less than 4 seconds.)

Sounds like typical narcissist behavior to me. Someone else suggested r/raisedbynarcissists and I also suggest this as a good place to vent!!
Google "Boys and Girls Club's Keystone Law."
That's okay, replying to me still means a lot! I just turned 19 
Thank you so much that sounds like it would help a lot! Where did you buy the candle from?
Yeah it's like they are so brainwashed they actually get mad at me, the non smoker, for having a problem with it, and then they tell me it's "not healthy" to sit in my room all day lol

It sounds so crazy saying out loud how they actually are
Thanks, it's good to hear someone else can relate. Even tho it's a shitty situation in general 
Thank you sooo much this is definitely gonna help 
I know it's insane :/ congrats on quitting tobacco though!!!!! & thanks for the subreddit link I'm gonna check that out!
I just saw this and looked it up, and wow I didn't even know that law existed! I'm 19 now but I've been told that unless I'm 21 I can still be counted as a minor if I'm dependent on my parents legally or something like that but I'm not sure 
Not the person who commented, but you can find them at Dollar Tree or WalMart. They also make a candle specifically for smokers so their house doesn't smell, which you can also find at those places!
I used to work at a vet clinic and I got one from there however I'm sure that a local pet store would carry something like that or even Walmart if you're willing to look around for a bit 
https://www.walmart.com/ip/Pet-Odor-Exterminator-Candle-trade-Mulberry-Spice-Jar-13-oz/48261431

This is the exact same brand I used, I don't know why it costs a little more but they last a really long time.
Thanks! It was pretty hard to quit tobacco!
I don't know your exact situation, but you're an adult at 18 in this kind of situation. Did your parents tell you that? I don't mean to sound mean, my parents would tell me crazy lies too.
Oh thank you so much! 
It'll be so worth it, thank you so much! I had no idea these existed. I've tried using candles but most were just for decorative purposes and didn't give off much of a smell 
On friday I had a meeting with police to discuss my sexual assault. 
I was assaulted after a night out. A stranger came into my house and verbally tried to get me to have sex with him, he then took off my skirt so I left my own house to get away from him. Whilst i was figuring out what to do on the street i was grabbed by another stranger who lead me down an alley and tried to sexually assault me. I felt his penis on my vagina but there was no actual 'sex'. The police found me and took me home and took my clothes. I was incredibly drunk and didn't remember what had happened until a few weeks afterwards. I self referred to the rape crisis centre and went for a counselling assessment with my ISVA. I was told to contact the police by my ISVA (independent sexual violence advisor) as I had remembered more details about what happened. During the police interview on friday I felt interrogated and uncomfortable, the DC kept referencing that I 'had been wandering the streets in my knickers' and when I explained this was because of unpleasant events in my house she just said that they might be 'false memories' and that 'maybe i'd just wandered off'. I was made to feel it was not a serious sexual assault and that because I was drunk that basically she didn't believe it was a stranger, she told me that 'it might have been someone you met in the club and gave the wrong impression and he's tried it on with you in the street' which i know is wrong. I was dismissed as a drunken student who had lead someone on and misinterpreted what happened. I felt humiliated and really upset and I was on my own so the only place I could think to go was to my student support officer (i have a good relationship with her) where i broke down and cried for half an hour (i never cry). I have to go back to the police tomorrow to formalise a statement and have forensics done and i'm terrified. I know i'm going to get upset and i just don't know what to do
I am so sorry about what happened, and it was not right the investigator dismissed you in such manner. Can you have your student support officer come with you tomorrow?
I'm so so sorry that you've had to go through with this whole ordeal. It has obviously been dealt with horribly by the police and what they have said and done is so endlessly unprofessional and potentially damaging. The only advice I can give is to try and not let their approach to the situation invalidate your trauma or your feelings. Do you have any more options of people to go to or a support network? Again, I'm so sorry that the system has failed you in this way. Stay strong. 
I'm sorry that this happened to you. Absolutely none of it was your fault, and it's terrible that your explanation is being dismissed or taken lightly. I believe you.

It's a common experience to feel hopeless and suicidal after a trauma like this, especially with police reactions essentially re-traumatizing you. You are absolutely not alone. And all emotions are temporary, even the very painful ones. Maybe you can contact the ISVA again, or a professional who specializes in crisis counseling? (I am certified as a crisis counselor myself, through a 60 hour training, though I am not a licensed therapist.)

If you want to continue the investigation, try to remember that this incredibly difficult process is working towards these men getting found and charged. It is also 100% valid to decide to stop at anytime. You can choose to move forward with whatever feels most healing.
You need to stand up for yourself. Don't let the police try and manipulate your story. You just need to be clear on the facts. What you know is what you know. I mean, to me, the second part doesn't sound true but I do believe the first half. Something serious happened and you need to report it. The police aren't some happy clappy rainbows and sunshine community organisation. They have the power to hurt people and they use it willingly. Most police officers get fucked up on the power trip. Be clear about what happened to you, it doesn't matter if the details are vague because that's what happens with trauma, just be sure that it did happen and that it was assault. 
gave the "wrong impression" what the fuck? this is such a horrible thing to happen. i'm so sorry it happened to you. don't let ignorant "authority" figures belittle you, you know what happened. don't doubt yourself or keep replaying the events in your head, second guessing. you have complete control over the outcome of this situation. don't let others hide your voice, fight. get an attorney. let us know how tomorrow goes. you have a strong support system here. take good care of yourself and pm me anytime.
What happened to you is terrible.
 I've read up extensively on criminal codes and procedural aspects of the court system. Given that the US is different that may be limited but police have some commonalities that lead to prosecutions.
I say this because I'm probably about to get some hate. Going to the authorities was an important move and it seems like you're adamant about going through with forensics and the police report. I would advise against that.

Cops can be callous assholes and there procedural methods for determining criminal prosecution will bring that out in them. Forensics will feel dehumanizing and will yield little results due to no "sex" and the passage of time. Also problematic is the fact that both men are strangers and will be unidentifiable (passage of time again).
Given all this, I doubt anyone will even be arrested for the horrific crime and it is nearly impossible to get a conviction.
 I was robbed at gunpoint in broad daylight a decade ago and even though the cops came within 2 minutes (witness called them) I refused to make a report because of the hassle.

What you are going through is a million times worse and I think talking to the support officer and maybe a counselor is your best bet. There are numbers to call in case your thoughts darken. I wish all you all the best in your recovery.
If you're up to it, we should PM--I work in this field and I would love to help. Are you in the US?
I feel like you're having a logical reaction (not a good one, mind you) for how you were treated.  You've done everything right, especially reporting your case to police.

>she just said that they might be 'false memories' and that 'maybe i'd just wandered off'. I was made to feel it was not a serious sexual assault and that because I was drunk that basically she didn't believe it was a stranger, she told me that 'it might have been someone you met in the club and gave the wrong impression and he's tried it on with you in the street' which i know is wrong. I was dismissed as a drunken student who had lead someone on and misinterpreted what happened.

The police should never judge a victim when trying to ask for information. If there was a guy walking half-naked, it wouldn't be an opportunity for him to be raped by a woman.  The officers are i the wrong for saying you were asking for it, and want to brush the whole thing under the rug. Show them that the behavior a guy had on the sidewalk is terrible! No matter the circumstance!
The police are evil. I'm so sorry this happened to you. If you can, you might want to hire a lawyer as soon as you can find one. Also, try to secretly audio-record your interaction with the police, especially if it is legal for you to do so, starting from when you go back to the police tomorrow. 
No she doesn't work weekends. I can't even find a friend to go with me. Its so distressing that i'm considering stopping reporting it because i am so anxious, i haven't left my bed all day and the police had asked for the contact numbers of my housemates and i know they'll be angry if i drag them into this, they've already told me they don't want to hear/talk about what happened. I think i might just stop the report, i feel horrible that he could still be out there but i feel like there is a real risk i will do something stupid tonight because of my anxiety.
As you  can see, he is still out there somewhere, as difficult as it is, bringing it to the authority's attention is probably the best bet you can make. It sounds like not only are they not supportive, your housemates are actually blaming you for your misfortune. Please don't let that get to you and remember that it was not at all your fault -- no one ever asks for a rape.

I wish I could offer to take you and keep you company when you are in so much distress (am a woman), but unfortunately I am in the U.S., thousands miles away from where you locate. So I guess the next best thing I could offer is some moral support online. If you want, I'll stay online while you go to the police office and stand by if you want to talk to an online friend anytime.  Internet hugs to you.

This is almost painfully timely. Thank you
I decided to change a lot of things in my life today. By this evening I had fallen into old patterns. But seeing this made realize I did make it 3/4 of a day and I might make it a whole day tomorrow.
Hey, how are you now?
[deleted]
I know i understand you. It happens with me too. Although I'm quite extrovert and easy going around people but my depression has made me an anxious person. I hate when my hands start trembling and when  i try hard to stop it, it makes it worse. I hate it so much. Almost feel like I'm going to lose control and have a panic attack right there. 

It's hard to deal with depression and anxiety at the same time. Wish we could be 'normal' like other people. It's so easy for them to go out, buy things, ask for extra ketchup.. i mean, how?

One thing I've noticed is if i hate myself or cuss myself, it makes me feel more pressurised and makes my anxiety worse. 
I guess you should try not hating yourself and being nice to yourself. I know it's hard but it might work for you and help you from making anything worse. 
[deleted]
I'll try your method next time. Thank you! Hope it works for me too.

I agree with you on including therapy but I'm still sceptical about meds. I've never taken them myself but know a few friends who take them and told me about the side effects. I fear they might make my depression worse than it is. 

Well thank you and Good luck to you! Hope everything gets better for you soon! 
Hi there, 

All new posts are made an announcement for a few hours to get them more attention :) 

If you see a green post at the top and it has no comments, give it some love. Let's try to make every new visitor feel welcome. 

It's mentioned in the sidebar, too. 

thanks
Not a fan of this, just stick to Reddits format. If people feel they can contribute something they will. 
Thank you for your input. 

To clarify, nobody is required to comment - it's just a request.  The intent is to give new posts more attention and make new members feel more welcome. 

This post got 90% upvotes, so I am assuming most of the members are in favour of this approach. 

However, I welcome anyone to comment and give your feedback so we can improve the subreddit together :)
I respect that your intentions are good and people seem to agree with you. Shame, this sub has now become that guy that always flags emails as important 😂. Hope the rest of Reddit doesn't follow this. 
Hehehe :) Well the intent is not to downplay actual important announcements, but please consider my rationale: 

- I have been moderating this subreddit for over 3 years and always saw a lot of posts looking for input / advice / opinion, and receiving zero comments 

- A lot of the zero comment posts would stay that way and eventually get buried under new posts, and slowly fade away 

- Since implementing this system, more posts are getting comments, i.e. more questions are being answered, more opinions are being shared, more resources and help is being accessed

- Because this is a mental health support subreddit, it wasn't sitting well with me that people in vulnerable situations were not being heard

I totally get it! I think it's really neat, and a clever design. Wonder if it was deisgned by a mentally ill person too.
[deleted]
I like it. Would be a great icebreaker for conversations surrounding mental illness 
Ordered!
Maybe one with a large semicolon too? 
as someone dealing with anxiety every day, this pisses me off.

first of all, the logo sucks. It looks like it's some awful TV show or movie logo. Even if you did want to have it as a conversational topic regarding anxiety, nothing about it stands out nearly enough, and no living person would look at this and think "Oh yeah this guy has anxiety"

Secondly, no legitimate anxiety victim would want to wear this. At worst, it conveys none of the intended message, and at best, assuming everyone magically knows what it's intended to be, it's almost cringeworthy to display this kind of thing proudly unless you're just looking for attention. No one wears shirts around that advertise that they're schizo or bipolar.

It just seems like a ploy to sell shirts to tumblr by pretending to be sensitive.
Thank you so much! :) Yes it was designed by myself, George, out of my own personal experience with severe anxiety.
I also don't get it. Glad I'm not the only one.
Hi there, I'm really sorry to hear you suffer from anxiety everyday, as I do myself and I know it's a bitch. I'm also sad to hear you don't like & appreciate this T-Shirt as someone who does suffer from a mental illness, which we are trying to raise awareness for. As much as I appreciate your opinion regarding anxiety victims wearing the T-Shirt, almost everyone who has bought one of these has suffered or is suffering from anxiety and wears it proudly showing they do to break the stigma. If you looked through our story, you may have seen people wearing the T-Shirt who suffer themselves. 

This T-Shirt is not a ploy to sell shirts as in fact, we do not make money on this T-Shirt, a portion goes to  YoundMinds charity. I'm not pretending to be sensitive, because I suffer myself, so you're basically saying I'm not sufferer. I hope you can understand and sorry that this may have upset you! 
Neither do I. 
I guess I can understand that. Either way, where I live, admitting that you have anxiety results in complete social isolation, as no one wants to associate with you, something I am still feeling the ramifications of.

Either way, i feel like outright stating you have something is not a good to fight stigma, as it can often lead to more abuse unless the stigma is already gone.

Oh well, good luck to you.
From the website: "What does it feel like to suffer from Anxiety? Words Fail Me." (The shirt says "Words fail me" in a different color from the rest of the letters)
[deleted]
The design is based on anyone who suffers/suffered from a mental illness. If you've suffered you may know how difficult it is to describe exactly what thoughts/experiences you're feeling to friends and family, depicted in the design of a word-search puzzle where all the words are jumbled up, the line 'Words Fail Me' is pronounced in red because words simply cannot describe it. Hope this makes more sense! 
I would like to make an analogy. Is it okay to push someone's wheelchair without asking just because you feel like they need help? If you see someone with a physical disability struggling at the store would you just assume they wanted your help? What if you saw a little person who couldn't reach something? Would you pick that person up so they could reach it?

If the answers to those questions are "no" then you should have the same respect for the autonomy of a person with a mental health disability. 

I am not a child. I am an adult. I am capable of knowing that I need to take my medication. If I don't do that, my mental health professionals will be asking me and they can tell. You are likely not qualified to know, based on one crying spell or one upset outburst, whether I am having a normal emotional episode or whether my medications are out of whack. It's beyond condescending to assume that it is my meds when it could just be a normal emotion. 

Apparently, based on another post, people who love people with mental illnesses think that it is within their rights to do this. I respect that people who live with us are affected by our mental illness. That's what you signed up for though. That doesn't give you the right to be invasive or parental. You do not get to say, "well I have to put up with this so I get to make sure you are less annoying by helping to ensure you take your meds." Nope. Sorry. Either you are living with a person with a mental illness or you aren't. The person with the mental illness has it six thousand times harder than you do. You have to watch, they have to live in that head. 

Compassion is important and if someone gives you permission to help them remember to take their meds or help them monitor their mood, respect that because that is a high level of trust. Don't abuse someone with that. Be kind and empathetic and know that is the ONLY scenario where it's okay to ask, "are you taking your meds?"
Glad I read to the bottom before ranting back! lol.   I depend on family members to pester me, or I forget, and only remember when I've gone all the way to completely miserable.  But yeah, they certainly do have permission; and I'd be very annoyed if someone outside that trusted ring made a comment like that.

Worse, it could even be dangerous, needle someone with less effective control on a violent disorder, you might not get apologetic pill taking as the result.

It sounds like you're right to remind people to do adult-adult interactions with you. Parent-child interactions are vomitworthy; try not to let them too much shape your identity.

Perhaps for some less responsible patients it's necessary to be condescending.
I think a proper analogy would be if you saw a person crawling on the floor and asked if he/she had a wheelchair. 

As someone who has done 6 months of psychiatry rotations and is also on some psych meds I don't see any issues with the question, "are you on meds?". But as with everything else in life, it should definitely be fine with compassion. Then again I don't see the point in doing anything without compassion... ever.
[removed]
Do you find condescension works for irresponsibility in general? I never really have. I mean, if you treat a teenager that way, they will just make sure to NOT do what you are asking of them.

I don't really think treating anyone with disrespect is the way to go. Also, if someone is "less responsible" in that case, they might need a better system. There are pharmacies that will put daily meds into a unit dose bubble pack so they just have to pop one bubble and all of their meds are in it etc. Some people get confused on if they have taken them or not for the day. For others, it might be as easy as setting a recurring reminder on their phone. That is still different than asking someone because you have determined they are acting odd.

If you really are concerned about someone taking their medications and they have a history of not doing so, then have an actual conversation about that. Be real about it and be respectful. Give that person dignity. They have a disability and deserve dignity like anyone else. You wouldn't condescend to someone just because they were in a wheelchair. You don't to someone with downs. You don't to someone with a psychiatric disability either. Let them know you are concerned. ASK if it's okay if you check with them. If it's not, find out if there is someone who is safe to ask. Don't be mad if you are not the safe person. Just find out who is. 

Everyone deserves dignity and respect. Always. Mental health patients are no different. 
Well, as a doctor your role as a healthcare provider is far different than that of say, my friend or mother. As a healthcare provider it would be completely reasonable for you to ask that question. There would be no possible interpersonal conflict that could arise that would precipitate a question like that. I would know it was purely a medically based question.

I think for many of us, we get asked the "did you take your meds today?" question when we are exhibiting behavior that is somehow deemed by the other person to be "undesirable." That could be quirky things like wanting to die a streak of hair pink or paining your nails blue. It could be crying in public and embarrassing the person you are with or even crying at home. Whatever it is, all of the sudden with that question, you know your behavior or emotional state is not acceptable to the person you are with. It's not okay to be how you are or feel how you are feeling.

It's a VERY invalidating question as well as a potentially condescending one.

Sometimes very "normal" people in terms of not having a mental illness do all of the things I described above. No one asks them if they are okay or if they took their meds. If they embarrass a loved one in public their loved one just gets mad or deals with it. Loved ones of people with mental illnesses immediately check to see if the meds are working. 

Most meds take more than one missed day to crap out. If I missed them today, odds are you wouldn't know. It would take two or three days and then I would know. It would probably take a few more than that to precipitate any kind of event where someone else knew. 

It is demeaning and it is awkward when someone close to you asks that question because of the usually reason behind it. They have decided you are misbehaving or broken somehow. 

Really, the constant monitoring in my case has caused me to adopt a complete mask. I do not outwardly feel anything anymore. Nothing. I work very hard at making sure emotions don't cross my face when I am home. It eliminates the questions. I only deal with them when I am with professionals like yourself.

Again, as a doctor you have a different role. I can see how your perspective would be different.
Compassion from the point of view of the asking person, or from the point of view of the person who's forgotten to take their meds? People justify some very terrible things by suggesting they are doing it with compassion; while the object of their action suffers and empowers the actor with their agony.

How do you communicate your compassion to someone who did not take the one thing that would allow them to perceive your compassionate intent?

I don't think you can just hand wave that away with a euphemism.
Edit: removed this post because it was in response to a post meant to be a form of harassment. It is no longer necessary. 
I guess it would be similar to asking "are you on your period?" 

I understand where you are coming from. It can be quite frustrating when you feel judged, especially by loved ones. 

>I work very hard at making sure emotions don't cross my face when I am home. It eliminates the questions.

I'm so sorry that you have to go through that. Many completely fail to see that this is a reaction and not a type of "acting out" behavior. 

I think in general I'm very objective and that's how I interpreted the question. I totally understand the dying hair example and see why it would be invalidating. I wish I had answers but I don't, but venting definitely helps =)
I think compassion is felt and not heard. 

>People justify some very terrible things by suggesting they are doing it with compassion; while the object of their action suffers and empowers the actor with their agony.

It's quite unfortunate that this is true but I don't find such actions as ones with compassion. 

>How do you communicate your compassion to someone who did not take the one thing that would allow them to perceive your compassionate intent?

If I had an answer to that.. lol. This must be one of the reasons that the "cocktail" exists I would think. If you have the pure intent of compassion and the other does not see it, then there is very little that can be done as far as I know. 
"this comment" and "this user" are vague.   Are you objecting to something I wrote, or something written in the post that was removed?

My apologies if my comment disturbed you in some way, not my intent.   I was just responding to the concept of when and when its not ok to remind someone about their meds...
I'll concede this, if someone saw me locked in my little life or death anger management battle after stubbing my toe or chipping a fingernail and gently said, "meds"; I would be very annoyed, but I'd also likely sulk back to the bathroom and find the pill I'd been forgetting...  then be very embarrassed.

So I dunno...   Family's actually very good at doing the nurse thing; they nurse, I keep working, everyone's happy.   So not too likely to miss anymore.

No. sorry throwaway. There was a post that I replied to that had "be well" underneath it. That comment has been deleted. You are fine. I'm sorry for the confusion.



I never wanted a stick so much in my life

I SO want someone to understand that this has been my life for as long as I can remember.
link down?

I'm sorry that happened to you. Writing is amazing self therapy. It has been for me too.
Reclaiming your power? Honey, he's the one who lost control. Not you. You had the power over him, not the other way around. Just because he may be physically stronger than you doesn't mean he is more stronger than you mentally. In that regard, you have proven you are his superior in every way. :) 
I disagree, only because it is extremely disempowering to realise that you are regarded as an object. Thank you though :)

I think you just need to keep up with your therapy. I also worry about the amount of assaults you've suffered. Reading you blog is horrible, you need to stop going and hanging around places were this stuff happens so much. I have never heard of the level of abuse you've sufferd
"You need to stop going and hanging around places where this stuff happens so much". Nice victim blaming. I'll just stay in my house for the rest of my life shall I? This all happened in regular places that young people go to socialise...
I am continuing with my therapy, thanks :)
I know countless people who have suffered similar abuse to me and much much worse. I think people are just not opening up to you
Invalidating much? 
She says in her blogs and posts she been abused multiple times, serially assaulted dozens of times. All I'm saying is a that seems like a lot and at a certain time you need to stop putting yourself in a situations where this might happen. 
And again, you don't know anything about the situation. Your username also involves "trump" so you're already at a huge disadvantage for anyone to take your comments seriously. 
I feel like you're not close to very many women if you find my posts shocking or confronting. Regularly being groped is a feature of many many women's lives. If you think this isn't happening to women around you then your eyes are shut. I am at the normal end of lived experienced of harassment/sexual assault from all the women I have ever spoken to.
My user name? What does that have to with my advice? She has a blog and wrote on reddit...pretty certain I know about the situation.
Please don't assume my gender. 
Well if you support Trump (still) it says a lot about your judgement/values.
Funny that's what my parents said about my support of Obama. Your reality is your reality, please don't force it on me. 
1. There are zero reasons to kill yourself.

I should really just stop there.

2. Suicide is not a way to be remembered. Living is.

Hannah becomes some sort of omnipresent folk hero in everyone's life after her death. Suicide is not a way to get attention. Those who love you will be forever scarred, but, as awful as this is, those who don't care about you or don't know you well will forget about you in no time at all. The only way to be remembered is to make positive impacts in the lives of those around you.

3. Suicide is not a tool to get back at people who have hurt you.

This is the driving force of the plot, and it's absolutely disgusting.

4. The portrayal of authority figures as completely inept and unable to help is problematic.

People care. Don't assume people know what you're going through if you haven't reached out to anyone. If by some awful, small chance you don't receive support from the first person you talk to, reach out to someone else. Most people are good. Most people want to help.

5. I don't know what Hannah's mental health issues were, but they certainly weren't depression.

As someone who struggles with bipolar depression I can only speak from my experience and my conversations with others and mental health professionals. Hannah's experience is contrived. It may be relatable to the average American teenager, but is not to those who actually suffer mental illnesses. A depressed teenager does not have enough agency and organization to plan an elaborate scheme to get back at those who have wronged her. It's a serious accomplishment if a depressed person can get out of bed in the morning.

6. The show has a direct correlation with an international increase in suicide rates among teenagers.

Australian organization "headspace" has seen a sharp rise of teenagers mentioning the show when they call for help. Teen suicide rates in Brazil have risen 100% since the show's release. We have yet to see research on what the impact on American teenagers will be. (Contact me if you want sources.)

7. Violent scenes of suicide do not deter people from acting. It normalizes it.

Here's an idea. If we want to discourage teenagers from killing themselves, how about we don't show a detailed portrayal of the means and method of how to do that.

8. Critics love the show. Mental health professionals do not.

I have found dozens of reviews from the media praising the show for it's "realistic" portrayal of teenage issues and mental health. Google "13 Reasons Why" and "mental health." See what actual doctors are saying about this show.

9. If you're going to blame the friends and family of a victim of suicide for not seeing the warning signs, you should probably dramatize some actual warning signs of suicide.

A major theme of the show is the inaction of those surrounding Hannah in her life. This is a real problem, but it doesn't help that Hannah shows absolutely zero signs of suicidal ideation given by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

10. It glamorizes suicide (yes, even as it claims it's a bad decision).

No, you're right, a good looking, likable, relatable protagonist choosing to kill herself won't be influential at all to young people struggling with suicidal ideation.

11. Discussion is a good thing, but media attention on the topic of youth suicide is rarely a good thing.

http://www.self.com/story/13-reasons-why-suicide-and-mental-health 

This article shares the "Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide," eight rules of portraying suicide in the media to prevent copycats. This show explicitly breaks every single one.

12. The cure to mental illness isn’t for some guy or girl to love you, thereby proving your self worth.

Also my problem with "Silver Linings Playbook." The story ends by implying that if Clay had simply reached out and done more, Hannah's life could have been saved. I'm sorry for the language, but that's f*cked up.

13. All of this would be concerning, but much less harmful if it was only watched by adults. Unfortunately "13 Reasons Why" is primarily watched and advertised to teenagers.

I'm sorry but I completely disagree with a few of your points, and they are actually offensive to someone who has lost a loved one to suicide. I also agree with you on several points as well, but would like to have a discussion and possibly get you to see how a suicide survivor (meaning someone who has lost someone from suicide) could greatly benefit from a show like this.

As a side note, this is all anecdotal, as my brother killed himself.

Point 1, "There are zero reasons to kill yourself". Yes, to a RATIONAL human being. But rational human beings don't kill themselves, do they? Suicide is often impulsive and irrational. Your point to just tell someone that "there are zero reasons to kill yourself" is not only detrimental to a suicidal person, but it also stigmatizes suicide and will lead to MORE suicides. Literature proves this time and time again, that one of the worst things you could ever do is to tell a suicidal person “there are zero reasons to kill yourself”.

Point 2, you claim "suicide is not a way to be remembered, living is" is the most offensive thing to someone who has lost someone to suicide, and I am tired of hearing this. If you had a brother that died from cancer, would you not mention that? Are you embarrassed of that? No, probably not. My brother died from a MENTAL ILLNESS, and he was not cowardly. He succumbed to a disease, and he is no less of a person for going through with it. Some people beat it, some people are not so lucky. But why should my brother not be remembered for the way that he died? Yes, it was graphic, and violent, but that is the truth, and not talking about it is the WRONG thing to do. Mental illness is real whether you believe it to be true or not.

Point 7, "Violent scenes of suicide do not deter people from acting. It normalizes it" I actually disagree with this, and literature varies greatly on this claim. I would agree that it maybe desensitizes you to suicide, and maybe this is actually a good thing. Again, the stigma against suicide is incredibly tangible, specifically just by reading your post, it is clear you really just don’t seem to understand suicide or specifically, survivors of suicide, in the way that you claim to. What is the difference between dying from suicide, and overdosing, or a car accident? Why is suicide so much more controversial than all three? 

I do agree with the majority of your other points, however, I want to point out that words DO matter. So while you may be thinking you are spreading awareness of suicide prevention, your first two points only stigmatize the issue further. I am saying this, again, as a suicide survivor. I am also a healthcare professional (registered nurse), and am a volunteer with the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention.

Suicide grief is unlike any other. People who lose someone to suicide are at an increased risk for suicide themselves, because they often have nobody to talk to. People have often said clichés like that to me, like “Don’t remember your brother by how he died, but by how he lived” and I’m sorry but that ISN’T helpful and made me feel even more shitty. It made me feel like I had to be embarrassed by the way that my brother died.  

I want you to understand that this show has been a source of comfort for me. I think just the fact that we are sitting here talking about the concept of suicide, and not sweeping it under the rug, is such a big jump in suicide prevention and awareness. But we have miles to go. I appreciate your time to write that post, and I hope you do not get offended by my response, but again, this is a cause I am extremely passionate about, and have been personally affected by. 
Watching the show makes me extremely uncomfortable and this puts into words a lot of what I feel. Would you be okay if I share your post outside of reddit?
FINALLY someone who isn't praising over it. The book was shit, too. Grossly inaccurate depiction of suicide. 
I lost my sister to suicide in 2015 p, and honestly I think it was the best treatment for her. She woke up every day, wished she was dead, and swallowed a handful of meds to get through her day. 

I'm not sure people see 13 reasons why the same way I do, but personally I think it's a good show for people to watch. It wasn't written to be a show your comfortable watching, it's for you to think about what you say to another human being and how that can effect them.

I think that Hannah making those tapes wasn't her "revenge" (if that's the word I want). I feel like the tapes weren't a finger pointing thing but rather "this is why Im killing myself, in the future watch how your actions affect others".

13RW gives a good look into hindsight. Immediately after she died they hung up posters to get help. At my school they did that when a boy killed himself, and when a boy died from a peanut allergy.

If you havent seen it, I recommend watching it with an open mind and critically thinking about it. Most people who hate on it now havent seen it, but the people who have experienced what Hannah did watch it and connect with it. This is a show that when teens watch they know; youre not alone.

I think the appeal of this show is that it takes something that can be scary and hard to comprehend and explains it in terms neurotypical people can understand. 

The character does what she does for clear reasons; people wronged her. Maybe those wrongs were petty but they still were *wrongs*; I think this is subtly comforting to somebody who hasn't experienced suicidal ideation because it frames the issue in easily solvable external terms; if *only* those people hadn't don't those things, she would have survived.

For me at least the reality of mental health is a lot more confusing. I've been suicidal before and my experience was that the "reasons" where typically a tangled mess that doesn't make any sense when laid out in terms of rational cause/effect. I know *rationally* that suicide doesn't solve anything and that the stressors in my life are temporary, but my irrational brain ignores that and instead tangles those temporary stressors into a giant web of confused experiences, regrets, guilts, ideaologies and so on. 

Trying to break that down for neurotypical people and explaining why quitting a McDonalds job (which I wanted to do and chose to do) made me also want to disappear is a huge mess and doesn't really make sense even to myself, so trying to articulate that panic and those feelings to others is extremely hard and I think most lay-persons don't understand, so they just check out of the conversation. 

But if I could clearly say "well I'm feeling this way because Steve wronged me" then there's a rational casual relationship. That's why so many of the people who support this show say shit like "we gotta stop bullying"; they assume the cause is solely external when in reality most people who feel this shit aren't bullied (or at least not more so than anyone else) or are past that stage in their lives yet they still do it. I think trying to actually articulate what it's like to be crazy is scary and confusing so people who haven't been there (and plenty that have) instead take the easy road out and don't engage 
Thank you. Seriously, if a girl is raped that does not mean she has to kill her self. She has to be stronger Than that and get helps And if anything like that happens, don't go to school authority. Go to the actual police. 
Thanks for your reply, and I truly am sorry that some of my comments offended you. I too have been affected by this by being a suicide survivor and losing loved ones to suicide. Human experience is incommunicable, and while I can never know what your experience was like, and nothing I can say can approach true understanding, know that I am truly saddened by your loss.

I'll respond to your points one by one.

First, I am honestly glad this show has helped you. And you're right that this show has sparked great conversations about bullying, slutshaming, rape, and suicide among teenagers that wouldn't be happening if this show didn't exist. It's a well made show and an empathetic book about things we are both passionate about, and naturally many people have affection for it, but if one steps back from feelings for a second and actually look at the way it portrays the positive and necessary message it's trying to convey, you'll see that it fails miserably at it, and the vast majority of the mental health community agrees with me. It does some good, but the harm it does and is doing completely surpasses the good.

Point 1- My intention was never to crassly tell suicidal people that there are no reasons to kill yourself. I see how confusing my wording is, especially because I do not elaborate and I thank you for pointing that out. I know that the title "13 Reasons Why" doesn't actually say that there are valid (rational and healthy) reasons to commit suicide, and the book does a good job distinguishing this. The show does not. This first point was trying to say: this show seems to claim there are good reasons to kill your self, which is not the case. I see that that wasn't adequately communicated.

Point 2- It honestly breaks my heart that this hurt you so much. Like I said, experience is different for everyone. This is something that a social worker said to me when I was on the edge of a bridge, and it helped me. I never said that people kill themselves because they are "cowards" or "just seeking attention;" I was pointing out that that's EXACTLY what "13 Reasons Why" portrays, and it's sick. 

Point 7- Every article, study, and discussion I've had with mental health professionals agrees with me on this. I'm not being sarcastic, but honestly curious, could you share with me some sources that violent depictions of suicide is healthy for adolescents (struggling with mental illness or otherwise) to see?

There's nothing I can say on reddit to prove to you my authenticity or my medical record. I could be just some asshole who doesn't know what he's talking about. I don't know how I can validate my experiences to you, and you're right. I have no idea what others have gone through. But I do know that I have been cut down from hanging from the ceiling of my college dorm room. I do know that I jumped off a bridge when I was studying over seas. I do know that I was forced to suck down five bags of activated charcoal to flush out 500 mg of oxycodone flowing through my veins, and crapped blacked tar for the next 3 days. I know I have been hospitalized for bipolar depression over 5 times since I was 20 (I'm not sure the exact number because it's a little hazy from the ECT, because I was catatonic and didn't respond to any treatment). I know what depression feels like. I know what it's like to not be able to leave your bed, so you haven't showered in weeks and you have to piss in a bottle because you don't have enough willpower to get to the bathroom. I know what it's like to lose the will to live. What I don't know is why a show that targets a 12-17 year old audience and that claims to be a beacon for mental health awareness literally did everything doctors say should not be done when discussing these issues with teenagers.

Again, thanks for replying and I'm not offended at all. I also fully admit that I am not a mental health professional, and i trust you are being honest with your credentials, so if you think my post is harmful, I'll take it down.
Go for it! I work with teenagers, and they all seem to love it except for the ones who have actually dealt with some of these issues. It's good to know that I'm not the only one that was made uncomfortable by a show that seems to be getting universal praise (except from doctors).
I couldn't put my finger on the distance I felt from it, but this makes sense. It felt to me like something that was made by people *trying* to get it. I never really came close to suicide, but I had a shit ton of mental health issues in high school, and it was hard in a lonely, desperate, isolating and real way. This was like a boy I barely knew then decided to make a series about my experience. They kind of got the gist of it, but it didn't feel real. Maybe it's cause we are seeing it through the eyes of Clay, who really doesn't ever fully get it? 
> What I don't know is why a show that targets a 12-17 year old audience and that claims to be a beacon for mental health awareness literally did everything doctors say should not be done when discussing these issues with teenagers.

This part really hit home for me. I want to first thank you for sharing your story with me.

I would never want you to take down your post. I think these are healthy discussions that we SHOULD be having, and another reason why I love this show. I think it has brought about conversations that have always been too difficult to have. While you are under the impression (and correctly so, because there IS research that indicates reporting suicides on the news is actually detrimental), that this show may actually do more harm than good, I disagree. Again, this is purely my own opinion and something I like discussing. But talking about suicide in any capacity is always better than not talking about it. Whether a few teenagers may see the finale and believe it "teaches" them how to kill themselves, let's be realistic. There is already Google, they can already do those things. A show about it is not going to sway their opinions. But if this show opens up a few people's eyes to suicide and gets the conversation started in this country about mental health - that will do a WORLD of good.

Your reply was insightful, thoughtful, genuine, and heartbreaking. I am so sorry that you suffer from bipolar depression with multiple suicide attempts, and I am also grateful that you feel you can open up about it. 

I also like having these discussions, and you seem pretty well versed on the general medical consensus regarding suicide and violent images. I did try to make the distinction in the beginning of my post that some of my thoughts were purely anecdotal, not based on research. The problem is, there really isn't a ton of research, and I want more. 

But speaking from experience, I had an unhealthy obsession with the manner in which my brother died. He shot himself, and I used to google pictures of what that looked like. My therapist would constantly tell me it was unhealthy, but I don't know if it really was. I needed closure. I eventually desensitized myself completely to it. A death is a death is death. I learned that the manner in which you die should not be so significant. I have become much more spiritual since then.

I also really agree that the show did NOT do a good job at all in regards to suicidal signs. I wished I would have seen Hannah maybe give away her belongings, or start buying her friends lavish gifts (like my brother did for me). I wish I would have seen her do drugs, or be more reckless. I wish it would have shown her not sleeping, or sleeping too much, or not eating, or eating too much.

Again though, I think in the end, this show is a net positive (and there is no way of knowing that right now, it's just my personal opinion). 
Having a cordial conversation about heated topics online where two people who have opposing viewpoints can disagree while validating each other's viewpoints and experience. This is a very surreal experience.
This just gave me so much hope. Thank you for sharing your story!
About 10 years ago, I found that writing about my anxious thoughts in a journal helped me feel less stressed and more balanced, so I've been doing ever since.

For the last few years, I've been building an online therapy journal. I use it pretty much every day as a way to release bottled up emotions, reflect on life, and sort out my thoughts. Care to try it out?

https://www.kindmind.com

It's free. Journal entries are encrypted on the database. It's a fun project to work on.

I'd recommend using Google Chrome as it looks *super* janky in anything but Chrome atm.

Thanks!
Neat I've been looking for something similar to this
I started my own blog as an online therapy journal:  http://someofthisistrue.com

You made this? 
Super awesome! I'll definitely give it a go 😊
This is lovely! 

Definitely gonna try it! Been thinking about journaling again. Thanks for sharing! 
This has great potential.  I find journaling my days to be extremely therapeutic.  I also have a mental health blog, I will give this a go and if I like it I will gladly promote it
Are you going to add a social aspect to this? I think it would be a good idea to let people help each other out and give anonymous advice to each other. Just an idea tho :)
Great, hoping it serves you well!
Bookmarked. You write very well.
Woo hoo! Happy to have you onboard!
Thanks!
Great idea, and yes!, that's a goal I'm working toward : )

On top of being able to anonymously interact and share entries, I'd like to offer users the option to collaborate with a licensed therapist. That part is far off into the future, but I'm suuuper excited about it.
That's super awesome! If you don't mind my asking, what language did you use for the website? Fellow programmer here and I love seeing people actually make cool and useful stuff like this! It's a dream of mine to one day build an application that can help people :) you're actually an inspiration to me!
It's a Ruby on Rails app. I <3 Ruby. I'm about to start work on a feature that will throw some React.js into the mix which will be fun. Long term, I'd love to power it with Elixir on the backend and maybe Elm or Ember.js on the front end. Sooo nerdy, I love this stuff.

Many thanks for the kind words : ) I hope you *do* start working on something that can help people.
That's awesome! I actually just learned Rails in a software engineering course last semester. Good luck with your project. I'm excited to see what the future holds for it! :D
Hello r/mentalhealth!

I am the creator of one of the top apps for depression - MoodTools. I am also a medical student at the University of North Carolina, and to make this app, I collaborated with several leading experts in the world of anxiety from UNC. After a year of struggling to balance medical school with app creation and 3 failed projects since MoodTools, I'm proud to finally release **[PanicShield!](http://www.panicshield.org/)** I have included the details below, but if you have any questions, just type up a comment or message me and I would be happy to respond! :) 

******

PanicShield is free app that can help those suffering from panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia! 

PanicShield contains 4 different tools to protect against panic attacks:


**Guide**: Learn about the mental mechanisms of panic attacks, how to use the other portions of this app, and find helpful internet resources.


**Breathe**: A simple paced breathing tool that can help calm you down before a potential panic attack or during a panic attack. Simply breathe in and out as the circle grows and shrinks.


**Internal Exposure**: Train your mind to not be afraid of certain internal bodily sensations that you may associate with an imminent panic attack. Based on interoceptive exposure therapy.


**External Exposure**: Train your mind to not fear certain external situations or activities that you may avoid out of fear of having a panic attack there. Basically, how to overcome agoraphobia. Based on systematic desensitization therapy. 

******

PanicShield is available for both iOS & Android at http://www.panicshield.org/

TL:DR I tried many, after the initial horrible side effects, they stopped my suffering (I was no longer suicidal), but I now could no longer feel Joy/the highs of life. The medicine kept me alive, but there was no real reason to be alive.

Psychology and other intervention strategies including exercise, meditation, diet changes and socialization helped. I now view medication as a last resort in case of emergency. 

I have elaborated upon my experiences in a blog post here: http://www.zachary-phillips.com/blog/antidepressants

I would love to know your experiences/which ones (if any) work for you? Currently I am taking Valerian tablets to reduce my anxiety (they work, but the effect is slight)

exact same situation. on antidepressants I don't feel sad but I never feel happy either. 
My experience with ADs has been really quite negative. The very first time I tried them I was pretty low and it took everything in me to admit that I had problems. Prozac. I think I waited 4-6 weeks and felt no change other than the side-effects. Then upped the dosage. There seemed to be a bit of a week-long improvement that flat-lined into grey nothingness that blunted everything. 

I personally feel that most improvement with ADs is a placebo effect which can be incredibly strong. At the time of taking them for that first time, I thought they would work; I was so relieved to know that the "chemical imbalance" was the cause that the little hope I found was enough to make me feel better. But it was short-lived and I eventually ditched them. 

A few years later I felt pressured into trying them again and I tried both Remeron & Effexor and never got beyond a week with either. Facial numbness & swollen tongue - kinda like a bee-sting sorta thing. 

Then about 5 years ago I had an additional breakdown and even though I did not believe AD would have any impact, I was willing to take just about anything to feel better. I cannot remember what drug I was given anymore but it about killed me. I would have given anything for that feeling of "nothing" again. I never experienced anxiety so powerful in my life. I did not sleep. I did not eat. I did not go outside. I could not sit in a room alone. My thoughts were disturbed and disturbing. I thought about hurting myself constantly but hid it all away for 6 weeks just thinking it would pass. Finally I couldn't do it anymore and gave up again. Within a week I was back to square one - which was still pretty low but no where near the state I was in while on that last drug. I cannot say that everything that happened in that period is the fault of those tablets, but I know I never felt anything like it before or after.

I just want to say that my thoughts on the placebo effect are just mine. You do not have to agree with me and I know many people will want to say I'm wrong. That's OK. There is quite a lot of research available about these drugs for anyone who would like to look into the facts and draw their own conclusions. 


I've tried Sertraline and Citalopram. Both have worked very well for me. It didn't dull my feelings, it only removed my anxiety, which I would rate ranging from mild (being afraid of going out, feeling down) to severe (panic attacks, constant crying, depersonalization, suicidal). 

I still feel down and anxious at times when something happens, but I can recover quickly. My ability to feel joy hasn't been affected at all. I can put things in perspective and trust my perceptions. They make me a normal functioning person. 
Hi Zachary,

I've read your blog post and it's something I can very much relate to. Medication made me feel better, but it didn't fix my entire life, which is pretty dull... I work from home for a big company. I'm computer-bound, have a specific schedule, and a really mean and manipulative boss...

I was lucky enough to find a great therapist who helped me to take the corpses out of the wardrobe and work through my main problems... I have taken important decisions to change my life in a way that reduces greatly the risk of depression relapse. Blogging also helped me a lot and forced me to read many inspiring books that changed my life.

Eventually, I found a new purpose in life. I'm about to quit my depressing job, I dumped a boyfriend that would make me feel cry al the time, and it feels awesome! I guess that's the solution. Reorganize your life so you can do more of the things you (used to) enjoy and quit what makes you feel depressed. 

Mindfulness also helps a great deal. It teaches you how to find joy in the insignificant things and simple moments. That's what life is about.

I invite you to read my blog:   

http://climbingthecliff.com/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-depression

I'm currently doing the 8-week MCBT program and I find it really helpful.

Take care,
M.
 

Nice blog:)

I am a fan of mindfulness based interventions personally I have found that grounding works well for anxiety attacks and depression.

Personally I carry meditation/stress beads to play with as a focus point. Mantra or breathing repetition works well on these.

Other then mindfulness, what have you found that has helped?
Science says that these three are about equally as effective:

* medication
* therapy and CBT/DBT skills building
* exercise

Definitely if medication isn't working for you, try the other two.

Also, medication isn't a cure-all.  Meds can make it easier to make progress, but if you've been held back for years and years, then it can take some time to build the skills before you can really start adulting better.
Antidepressants did nothing for me. 

I tried Citalopram, Tianeptine, Imipramin, Mirtazipine and Agomelatin. 

When I was taking high doses of Imipramin, I experienced a short episode where I finally felt like I got my life back. I was enthusiastic, curious and actively tried to climb out of depression. But the positive effects faded quickly.
The only side-effects I've noticed from medication have been negative (Weight gain, weight *loss*, sexual dysfunction, increased anxiety and blood pressure, etc.).  The main problems I had with meds were: 

1. The withdrawal side-effects were usually worse than any symptoms I had before starting the medication; and 

2. No matter how many pills a doctor forced me to take in order to not be locked up in a psych ward (or *while* I was locked up in a psych ward), I was still going to be someone whose life had failed abjectly and completely.  I couldn't medicate my way into having a job.  No amount of pills I took was going to make me *not* have graduated third from the bottom of my class.  Pills were never going to change the external circumstances of my life or remove the external stressors.  At best, they could only be a temporary relief, one that came with *additional* misery upon stopping them (in addition to any temporary doped-up removal-of-ability-to-care "benefits" that the doctors all promised would happen *any day now if only I just BELIEVED*).  
(full disclosure - I cannot ready your blog because of the blocker at work).

Have you tried therapy? It is not an overnight fix, but it can hopefully  make the anti-depressants a short-term thing. I would also through out, are you sure that it is the medication making you flat and not depression?
It sucks hey,

How does it feel for you?

Have you spoken to your doctor/psych about options?
Thank you so much for your response,

I may have tried Prozac but I'm not 100% sure, but the experience sounds familiar.

There is a strong placebo effect, the research is fascinating, but there is still some statically significant improvements beyond placebo for most meds (if you can get one the doesn't fuck you up in the process I suppose) 

I didn't have the effects of numbness of the tongue, but my mum has had 'snapping jaw' and other similar issues.

And man that sounds horrible, but unfortunately very relatable.

IMO meds are a blunt instrument. Impacting neurotransmitters or the 'chemical imbalance' so significantly that they produce the crazy side effects.

They can keep you alive, but my they alter you in the process. By definition that are changing you.

So the person that needs them is different to that who is on them.

Personally I like meditation, exercise and writing, what have you found that works? And how are you now?
I am so happy for you, and your story and effects are what most people seem to feel from the medications!

Did you have any temporary negative side effects?
Nice blog:)

I am a fan of mindfulness based interventions personally I have found that grounding works well for anxiety attacks and depression.

Personally I carry meditation/stress beads to play with as a focus point. Mantra or breathing repetition works well on these.

Other then mindfulness, what have you found that has helped?
I feel that meds change the chemical balance, but don't teach you how to change the thought patterns. A great start, but not good for the long term (if you plan on stopping them eventually)

I need to read up on the effectiveness of different intervention strategies to be honest though.

Can you recommend any starting places for research? 
How quick are we talking? Could it have been a placebo rise in good feelings?
That sounds intense, by forced were they physically restraining you to stay? Or could you leave but with lots of verbal pressure?

And yeah, meds don't change the circumstances of your life - just the chemicals of your brain.
Yeah I have put that in there,

Therapy hs been a big help (once I found one that was competent/listened etc) I highly recommend them to all.
And the medication I think was causing the effect (I tried a few different ones - for all, the depression and negative thoughts lifted,  but the world seemed colourless/joyless. Not good or bad, just bland.

Like my range of existence was muted to a narrow middle range

Each medication did it to me, but therapy, exercise, diet etc really helped to 'add colour' back to my life
Yeah. I can't afford therapy ao I'm just going to try different medication and see if that's the problem.
I think I read that for the severely depressed there is sometimes a bit of a lift on ADs but for the mild to moderately depressed the effect is minimal to not much at all. I would say that if you're severely depressed and suddenly those emotions are blunted, you will see that as an improvement. Being in pain constantly and then suddenly not being able to feel so much pain must feel better? It's not that you *actually* feel better, it's that you just don't feel so much of the bad you felt before. I'd list that as an improvement but not a success. 

As for how I am now... not great. I exercise daily, eat well, have studied and tried to make use of mindfulness to understand why I feel the way I do, as well as ERT for my OCD, but not much works that well.

The best advice I can offer anyone with mental health issues is to go outside everyday without fail. Just walk. Other than drugs it's the one thing that helps calm me and the only time when I can make sense of much of the garbage in my head. I seem incapable of mastering meditation so exercise is my thing. 


My libido went down in the beginning. I've had trouble with it from before but recovered at the same time that my anxiety was at its worst. Don't know if there is a correlation. It's normal now, on the low side, but still higher than it was before the anxiety low. 

The libido issue began with hormonal contraceptions for me, and it has never gone back to what it was before. I'm pregnant now and hope that afterwards some of the effects of the contraception will be undone (scanty period, low libido). 

I'd like to try SNRIs in the future to see if the effect is better than SSRISs. I'm at my happiest with some dopamine floating around my system. 
I like yours too :)

Well, I have tried many things, and I'm continuously researching new methods and findings. But what I like most is walking in nature, sunshine (even the fake one from a SAD lamp), and omega-3 acids. Coloring also helps a lot because it occupies the mind, and mindfulness-oriented sports such as climbing and horse riding are awesome - it's the best way to be here and now. They make you focus your whole attention on bodily sensations and stop rumination.

I'm also attending CBT therapy and reading a lot of insightful books, some have been quite a revelation to me ;)

I had the positive effect maybe like a week or two. Placebo is always a possibility, but I don't respond to anything ever except for the side effects, so that would be odd. 
> by forced were they physically restraining you to stay? Or could you leave but with lots of verbal pressure?

When you're locked in a psych ward, the docs and staff can do whatever the fuck they want to you, whenever the fuck they want to, and who is anyone going to believe: the doctors and staff, or *the person the doctors and staff say is too crazy to be anywhere but the psych ward*?  

At best, at fucking **BEST**, medication in a psych ward comes with a subtle threat of, "If you don't swallow whatever we just handed you in that Dixie cup, you will never be allowed to leave."  

If the doctors and staff are having a bad day, or had a bad night, or just otherwise feel like it, though, they can dogpile you, tie you to a bed, force your mouth open, and pour pills down your throat while someone else shoots you up with whatever they have handy.  Then they write "noncompliant" in your report and keep you there a couple days extra as punishment.

Going out side - I like that:)
On mastering meditation, I heard the best advice on that topic was 'you are having the meditation that you are having now', good/bad etc it's all an attempt at meditation.

But your right, it is hard. I really like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: exercise, a challenge, meditative and combative it is amazing!

Interesting concept about the relative improvement, going from -10 to -3 is great... Kinda 
Congrats! I am expecting my first in a few months:)

How has the changes of baby hormones effected your system?

I too had issues with sexual drive - I was fine to perform, but didn't really care for it much. It was a weird feeling to not care about it to be honest 
Who knows, the effect can be different depending on the person and meds I suppose 
Wow, how terrifying. 

And your right, it is why those in power positions abuse people, who would most people believe?

Cops v criminals, teachers v students etc etc

I don't know how to fix the issue, it just sucks 
The hormones caused a complete mental breakdown. I checked myself into the mental hospital as I was depersonalizing and having suicidal thoughts in the end of the second trimester, and was prescribed medication there and began therapy specialized for prenatal and postpartum women. It was scary and very strange, since I'm usually very self-aware, but I couldn't stop the anxious thoughts and was afraid of doing something drastic to myself. Even in the mental hospital I was paranoid about their treatment of me, classic movie style. The combination of medication and a validating and compassionate psychologist (plus an amazing supportive husband) has helped immensely. 

My issues stem from family dysfunction, so I felt incredibly lonely as I'm no contact with almost all of my family, and have had anxiety as a result. I guess when you're having your first baby you want your family to actually give a damn. I have always had trouble trusting my perceptions and grew up with insecure attachment and invalidation of my perceptions (parents are likely severe BPD), so basically I don't trust that my perception of reality is true especially when it comes to how people treat me. This had been going on my whole life, but just one month into recovery now I trust myself a lot more and can answer back when my perceptions are minimized or invalidated instead of doubting myself. I can really see now that I was going nuts :D 

Congratulations on your baby. It's scary but I think she/he will show you how to feel joy despite everything :)

LOL What medication is this?!
If only it did that for me!  I'm on Trintellix and it's really nipped my libido in the bud (but done wonders for my mood!).  I'm entering into a new relationship with a possible romantic partner and I *want* to be able to have an orgasm with her.  I just don't see it happening.  I was on Wellbutrin about a year and a half ago but the antidepressant quality of it didn't do much for me (very treatment resistant).  Maybe I can see if my psych clinician will agree to trying it again.  Hmmm.
Wellbutrin? 

I'd never heard of it, but it's supposed to balance out the negative effects of the meds I'm currently on so maybe I'll be a normal person now
I was on Wellbutrin for a while. Can confirm this side effect. Also suppresses appetite. 

FYI, one of the reasons I stopped taking it was that it caused me to have memory problems. I couldn't remember what I had eaten for dinner the night before, what my good friend's last name was, conversations I had had recently, etc. The good news is that since getting off of it I think my memory has been completely restored. 
Shit works different for everybody so take my anecdote with a grain of salt, but wellbutrin worked great for me for a while. Combined with Lexapro, which I'd already been on and still take today, it really helped me with motivation and energy. Unfortunately it started to give me massive mood swings, weepiness, and eventually started contributing to anxiety spirals. So off it went, I really liked its positive effects though. Ah well
Boyfriend took it and this was exactly what happen. Unfortunately it didn't work quite the same for me. 
mehrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr you've scared me effectively
Holy hell, my psychiatrist suggested Wellbutrin, but I was like . . . "Nah, I'm good"
No two people's experience on a drug is going to be the same. You can always stop taking it if it's not going well for you 
That's fair. I really don't like changing medicines so I'm a bit nervous I guess 
I wrote this post after coming across people who talk about mental illness as if it is something cool to have. As a person suffering from bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, I find this kind of mentality a little uncool. People with these diseases are fighting day and night. There's nothing glamorous about the struggle. We should give them the respect and understanding they deserve. 

http://ibpf.org/blog/theres-nothing-romantic-about-mental-illnesses

[deleted]
People who romanticize mental illnesses fundamentally misunderstand them. Its an illness. Yet, because it's something going within the brain, its very easy for people to come with their own definition of what is a mental illness.

If I was to ask people if they'd rather suffer from GAD or have a peanut allergy, most will answer to take GAD because that's what they believe will have a lesser impact on them. I have both and I can assure you than GAD is worse than peanut allergies. But for someone who don't know about this, its not tangible and belong to the theoretical realm.

The focus on mental illness is a GOOD thing. We should have as much resources as possible available to everyone. We also have to be sure that we can get as many people as we can. We know there are some places, even in first world country, where mental well-being is considered optional.

If we want people to stop romanticising mental illnesses, we have to inform people.
I understand the problem, with fighting mental illness in the Indian society where it is stigmatised. I wish people wouldn't criticise or look at me with pitying eyes. I could only rise above it all when I accepted who I am. It took more than a decade, but I finally feel better.

But all of that still doesn't change the fact that romanticising the concept of mental illness is wrong. There is nothing glamorous about our fight and it should be respected. The severity of mental illnesses shouldn't be taken away because someone is feeling "down and depressed". 

People use those words as if they don't matter. "I am bipolar." They don't even know that bipolar disorder isn't a character flaw, it's a disease like any other physical disease. This doesn't happen with cancer. Then why are mental illnesses taken so lightly? 

That's the point.
I definitely get where you're coming from (and suffer the same disorders). It feels so belittling for people to speak hyperbolicly at social gatherings, using words for very serious disorders - which we live with every day - but meaning them in the most superficial sense. 

This is why I don't tell anyone about my illnesses. Either they'll assume I'm just being hyperbolic, or they'll look at me like a freak. No one romaticizes the mentally ill. They just want to be a "special butterfly" by having one, and if someone is *truly ill* it screws things up for them because then they can't pretend to be ill anymore. 
Mental health issues are pretty common. You are more than your "illness."
Honestly, romantacized depictions of bipolar have *helped me cope with it and feel less burdened by it*. It *helps me not feel so cursed* to see it as more than exclusively negative. I'm not saying glamorizing depression or psychosis is positive, but I think perpetuating non-romanticized stark versions of the disabling and debilitating aspects of mental illness *perpetuates stigma* rather than ameliorating it. There is certainly a way to display mental illness realistically, compassionately, and without exacerbating stigma, but if I had to pick one to drop it'd be the realistic element. I also think it's prohibitively difficult to achieve all three.
I guess it is perhaps got something to do with the fact that we're only just starting to take them seriously. Also, it's really hard for some people to get the treatment they need so their conditions will often stick with them for a really long time. 

I suppose attention-seeking behaviours are also sometimes actually part of mental health disorders themselves, though, so dismissing someone as attention-seeking when they think they suffer from some mental illness isn't really helpful. I've always thought that people with mental health disorders often end up partaking in attention-seeking behaviours because they actually need attention, even though the attention they get might not be the medical attention that they need.
I'm a psychiatrist and so pained to see my patients struggle with strangers.

Understanding of these diseases has advanced so much and psychothérapies are so much advancing too that you have more chances to have a descent life with a mental disease.

Society is a bit late and is not iterested enough in the lives of bipolar or schizophrens. May be the media and Hollywood can help?

Your patient has awesome drawing skills...

And a knack for a pithy and well delivered punchline. Thanks for sharing. 
For some reason, I can only imagine reading this with a Russian accent. 
Awesome comic. I would track down more of this person's work, they have a real flair for the medium.
What is this? Game of thrones?
This is so good! Do they have any others to share?
"The strongest of men will fall to fate if he has no judgement!"

Can we discuss what this means to us?

I am a Mental Health First Aid instructor in Sydney, Australia. I thoroughly recommend checking out the MHFA website for more info and to learn all about ALGEE! www.mhfa.com.au
Common sense and a little maturity would bring one to this usually successful response.
It also works for hysterical children who feel out of control.

Physical touch, hand holding or a gentle hug.

Direct person to look you in the eyes, so you make one on one contact.

Continual, monotone repetitive calming " Every thing is all right... Everything is all right.... again, to get them to focus on your words, the sound of your voice.

Begin calming breathing, have them accompany you. This is the standard slowly inhale through nose, a gentle breath hold and slowly exhale. 

Repeated 10 times or so most people are able to get themselves under control. 
This is a really cool idea. It makes me want to take the class.
They have these, and I was fortunate to take this class for free. It was really good! 
Great idea!
Or for info about MHFA in your country... https://mhfa.com.au/cms/international-mhfa-programs#mhfa_usa
I used a technique where you breathe in slowly and hold it for five seconds, then out and hold for five. I read somewhere, a long time ago, that it slows the heart rate. It was touted as a way to get control when experiencing a phobic response. If I was faced with someone else, not me, having the attach, I'd probably gently coach them to do this. 
Thanks! I have been looking for how to provide mental health help when there's no professional help available (no insurance + no professional who speaks a common language with the affected...). All I find (except some advice in case of large-scale disaster) just emphasizes getting professional help ASAP, so it's really useful that you wrote what can be done without it. I once calmed down  someone (and made stop self-harm) by hugging them, but I don't know what to do when the distressed person directs anger at me or/and when I don't know how (un)comfortable they'd be with me touching them. A few times they calmed down in a few minutes while I just remained calm and kept looking in their eyes, but not even that is always possible.
Well, of course you never want to put yourself in a situation that is dangerous, but as a mom and a gramma, I've dealt with people going off, children, troubled people and have found these simple acts of caring can often help calm them.

Doesn't Fix their issues but but to get them back to calm focus.
Luckily I don't get to deal with armed and physically violent people so it probably isn't really objectively dangerous (though some of them are twice my size so it does get scary). I wish I knew how to also help them "fix their issues" long-term :/ 

I think it's because tv show producers don't think regular therapy is interesting. They don't really care about the actual story behind something, they just want people to fight.

The thing is, Hoarders has led me down the well of mental disorders and led me to manage my own clutter. That has helped a lot. But I do think it pushes for the drama rather than "hey, let's just focus on giving you the tools you need". And more often than not, people are also facing eviction or the city coming to clean up their property.

It isn't very fair, but I also don't really like the way traditional therapy goes--they never come to your home, never see the way you interact with people, never see you except in their office. Most of the therapists I've been to, see me as calm and collected in their office and then just wave off my concerns of being borderline or dealing with C-PTSD. I couldn't be, because I'm not reacting in that moment, because of course, we all know OCD people consistently re-arrange everything they're around, and hoarders are always obvious from a distance _eyeroll_
Hoarders is the show that let me understand its metal illness that cause the hording. 

I'm field tech and I've been in and out of Hoarders houses, before I have no idea.

Mental illness awareness is too low IMO..  They need to do shows on crazy homeless people etc. 
A little off-topic, but my therapist thought that I was organized because I found my 10-pocket folder and stuck all of the stuff from the last six months into it.  (I kept carrying the same entertainment bag, and so I would have useful stuff from the last appointment within grabbing distance.)

I found a good comic about OCD on everyday feminism, I think.  The super-neat OCD was that way because otherwise they would hoard without any middle-ground.
Did some work at a Therapist house.. not sure what kind of therapist he does but his house was clutter fuck!

His office however is super nice like ones in movies.
So your idea of the best way to expose more people to mental illness is to show the absolute worst case scenarios? I'm sure that will do a lot to change negative perceptions such as the drastically overestimated likelihood of violence. Why not a show about the large number of people with psychiatric diagnoses who are living healthy productive lives?
"Crazy homeless people"
Are you sure you're a field tech?
No, because when I end up at those customers houses  I really look down on them.

After what I learn from the show, I see them much different now. 

Same with homeless people. after I learn about how mental illness can make a successful person into homeless in no time also widen my views.  After a homeless guy sat on my computer and start coding in C++ when I was stuck compiling. 6 figure income, something happen.. start drinking a lot, lost wife, kids and everything.

So is the US prison population.. some people just need right treatment to keep them straight. 

There are celebrities and athletes tries to promote Mental Illness Awareness but doesn't seem to getting traction as Cancer. 

I highly recommend his book The Noonday Demon. Every mental health professional should read it. 

This is a wonderful talk. I find it comforting to listen to someone who understands and articulates everything I am feeling so well. Thank you for posting this.
I have been watching Andrew Solomon's YouTube videos these days and they are very comforting and informative.  
Shame there isn't a link to the TED talk itself.
Yeah, good book.  Dude does his research.
I'll have to check it out :)
Yes!!!  "Far From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity" is fabulous, too.

Clicking on the link will take you to the talk on youtube.
I will! Thank you very much :)
Thank you

Nice job, I've tried doing that before but never seem to get anything on the paper.
I'm feeling the same way apart from I can listen to music and play with dogs.  
Right now I'm trying to encourage myself into the shower but I just can't be bothered.
aw thank you
I can relate. Do you find ssri's help.
I've been on many different ones and am currently on lexapro (along with other meds)

Favourited & shared. The stigma against mental health issues has to stop. I wish everyone would just take a moment to pause, watch and reflect on what their actions have on those who suffer with mental illness.
Beautiful video, thank you for sharing this!

Thank you for passing this on.  Please put it out to whoever you think may benefit.  yes I agree with you on all points : )
You're welcome.  Please share if you think someone you know may benefit from seeing it : )  Happy holidays.

Thank you for clarifying : )

This is really disturbing.  If this is happening to you or someone you know, please get them in touch with the Bazelon Law Center.

Some of the comments on that website are really disheartening. I fail to see how anyone's mental health could be helped by booting them out of a university they'd probably been striving for years to attend. 

The sad thing is, other depressed and suicidal students reading this could easily conclude that it's better to keep their problems hidden from view, rather than seeking treatment which might subject them to punishment or expulsion. 

Terrifying
By this account, Yale New Haven Psychiatric is not a very good place to go.
Second this. They helped me out when I had a similar situation

You always hear stories about love and physical illness but rarely about love and mental illness.  The truth of the matter is that mental illness pushes away significant others, boyfriends, girlfriends, etc. Thus pushing those that suffer from mental illness further away. I applaud him for sticking by his wife even through her struggles. 

What does that even mean? 
I really love this, thank you :)
It's trying to say that the most important thing is the present and to be mindful of it :) 

This isn't to say that plans for the future are bad and that reflecting on the past is bad, but that too much of either can be detrimental to really living in the here and now. 
Don't let the focus of your mind be dragged to the past or future, listening to the wind outside, or washing the plate in front of you is much more important than a grand failure of the past, or an ephemeral plan scheduled sometime in the future.


It all says it in these lines: “Healthy people are physically and mentally fit and balanced, have a variety of interests and a good social support network, which is what we should value and promote. Elite athletes are not immune from mental health difficulties just because they engage in high levels of physical activity."

It is important to see that: Fitness helps mental health (of course!) , but too much fitness is bad. Toomuch fitness is an addiction, and addiction is like any addiction bad for the health.

You can not outrun a mental health problem, but many mental health problems could decline when people start out exercising. Not only could - they will. Fitness and physical exercise is a crucial factor in mental health - just to make that clear, as the title could mislead.
I'd much rather be dependent on exercise than a pill. Yes, it can become a problem. But a bigger problem is all the people who don't try a proper diet, exercise, and sleep, before resorting to medication.
I think it depends a lot on what your issue is and what your fitness plan is.

I have anxiety issues and if I get in 5-7 hours of exercise a week and never go 48 hours without getting in at least 30 minutes, I find I'm a lot better.

I've cycled a century (100 miles) but did it once as part of my vacation and I don't go that extreme regularly. I think if the only way to manage is extreme sports, you need to look for further treatment but getting 4-8 hours a week of exercise in is healthy for anyone whether mental health or not.
Is there an "Over-Exercisers Anonymous?" If not, maybe there ought to be. I've been in "recovery" for several years now. The addiction damned near killed me twice in the '90s and early '00s. (Many years after putting the plug in the jug and throwing away my dealers' phone numbers.) Sigh. 

Figure this: If one already has the autonomic nervous system imbalances caused by [C-PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=c-ptsd&*), *moderate* exercise may help... but *over*exercise will only make it worse. 
I outran mine. 

TAKE THAT CAROLINE!
The potentially unhealthy part for me is bringing the same insecurities and perfectionism and OCD I do about it that I do to everything else. Although the anxiety is a big thing. I'm not crazy about our neighborhood and I felt a lot more at ease in the last two or three places I've lived in. One of which was the town I grew up in, all several square miles of it. And it was comfortable. I could go pretty much anywhere in or around that town. Leaving was kind of a trigger FOR most of my mental illnesses. It was like taking a step out onto the road ever onward and getting hit by a truck.
Guilty as charged...
I suffer from the autonomic  nervous system imbalances caused by DTD and I will say not only will over exercise make it worse, but for myself even "moderate" exercise will. It took a long time to realize that I never felt anything other than ill after exercise ( because we've got it so stuck in our heads our whole life that exercise is good, good, good), even yoga made me feel like death, until it got so bad, and I harmed myself even further INSISTING on exercise's power to help me, that I could not even exercise at all, whether I wanted to or not.
Yes; of course that happens on occasion. What is DTD? 
It's developmental trauma disorder. Unfortunately it often gets conflated with the more popular  C-PTSD. In some ways it's similar, but it makes the very crucial distinction of referring to repeated, prolonged, multiple trauma in the developmental (childhood) years. Though I would say for some even teenage years are higly significant ( people can very so much developmentally). Repeated abuse (and I include neglect completely as a form of abuse, in child and teenage years at least) when you're in your twenties will have a profoundly different effect from that when you're a child, because in the latter case your brain/body is infinitely more sensitive to what shapes it, which is, most of all, relationships with those they see as their caregivers, who hold life and death in complete control.
> developmental trauma disorder

...is a symptom-based label for the exact same thing as the neurobiologically-based label of C-PTSD. C-PTSD is "cause." DTD is "result."

> I suffer from the *autonomic nervous system imbalances* caused by DTD

C-PTSD *is* the neurobiological result of "repeated, prolonged, multiple trauma," e.g.: having been chronically or at least repeatedly neglected, ignored, abandoned, discounted, disclaimed, and rejected -- as well as invalidated, confused, betrayed, insulted, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, ridiculed, denigrated, derogated, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, dumped on, bullied, scapegoated, and/or otherwise abused.

My 10 years of post-grad school was (blessedly) as neurobiological as it was environmental-developmental. But for many, that's not the case, and they can only see the patient through the lens or filter of their more limited schooling. The DSM V is a reflection of that in no small part. The DSM V *is* useful, but it is too often the political manifestation of two ways of seeing the same exact thing from two different perspectives. 

In whatever event, the Dx label is merely an arrow (hopefully) pointing toward appropriate, effective and result-producing treatment. But failing to see the pt from *both* perspectives may mean failing to adequately treat his or her problem. 
How is DTD symptom based? The trauma IS the cause. Not the neurobiology. The cause is in the world. You say C-PTSD is the cause and DTD the result. That doesn't make sense. If the brain changes it changes due to occurrences that happen in the world. But then later you say C-PTSD is the result of the TRAUMA. I'm not sure what you're actually trying to say here?
For further illumination, please see [the OP on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/63vlgk/the_biopsychosocial_explanation/). Trying to make the point that continuing BPD thoughts, emotions and behavior are the result of a feedback loop involving *both* internal *and* external circumstances. But -- while sharing common genetics for ultra-sensitivity with the schizophreniform disorders -- BPD does appear to be largely "triggered into development" by early life trauma which then encounters behavioral modeling and other environmental (including cultural) factors. 

The vital thing to understand is that BPD is not *just* the result of genetics *or* trauma; it is that *plus* the influences and coping strategies we develop to try to deal with those genetics and traumas. One cannot change one's history or genetics, but one *can* deconstruct one's influences, and then dismantle and rebuild one's only partially effective -- but very costly -- ego defenses. [This article](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/treat-autonomic-and-cognitive.html) attempts to explain that in more detail. 

Believe me, one cannot have ingested as much Alice Miller, Diana Russell, Judith Herman, Bessel van der Kolk, Bruce McEwen, Ron Kurtz, Christine Courtois, John Briere, Bruce D. Perry, Peter Levine, Sonya Lupien, Robert Sapolsky and *many* others on the matter of trauma > C-PTSD as I have over the last 30 years and *not* reach at least very similar conclusions. (The list of resources at the end of [this article](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/03/understand-drama-triangle-understand-bpd.html) -- all of which I have read very carefully -- should attest to that, I hope.)

BPD?


Really fascinating commentary on suicidal states of mind, being a mother while struggling with mental illness, and distorted senses of truth that often come with living under the guise of depression. 

Why can I only see the one pic? Am i missing a link to click or something? I really wanna see!
[deleted]
Do you have anymore? I love this.
These are lovely! I'd love to see more of this. 
What I have learnt after being depressed for around 2 years now is that you never really get better, you just simply learn to continue existing.. Not for yourself but for the ones you love. 
I love this, thank you for sharing. In a way, I'm doing much the same thing right now too. Picking up my camera and photographing mundane things within my apartment (and so many cat photos) is a creative way of reminding myself that "I'm still here".
I really love this, thank you so much for sharing. A beautiful idea!
Reddit isn't a good place for anything artsy, but be assured, those are really nice pics.
Click where it says "Flickr" (kind of hidden)

Thanks :)
I'm currently on Prozac 60mg, Seroquel XR 800mg, and Klonopin 1mg x twice a day. 
Why not? 
Thank you so much! Brilliant photos! This is a really great idea - an awesome way to remind yourself of your triumphs: the 'mundane' things many people gloss over, but others (myself included) struggle with...

This video is amazing. It almost describes my issue exactly!
Thank you for putting this together. It's extremely brave of you to do this.
Very good video. Well done for speaking out. These kind of honest words really do help people. 
Thanks for putting this out there. I imagine it wasn't easy to do.
Thanks for this i can relate to *some* of it
Thank you jimmy17, I was really nervous to make this video, but I know how tough mental health struggles are and how lonely they make people feel. Your comment means a lot to me!
Thanks victorMike84. It was a tough video to make, but I hope it'll help someone out!
It wasn't easy tim2drum, but I'm glad I did it. Thanks for your comment!

My school counselling services dumped me. Even they think I'm just a waste of time and can't be bothered to help. So yes, I feel like society doesn't give a fuck, unless you are actually suicidal, in which case they just want to stop you from killing yourself, not help you to overcome that desire.
I think there is a real mix of people who are quite mean, people who are very supportive, and a whole bunch somewhere in between.  Your personal experience will depend on who your life had put you in touch with.
From my experience, it's rare that someone truly understands and wants to help. Many people take it as a opportunity to boost their self esteem by basically saying "Oh, you're miserable. I'm good." which is just really sad.

Even when it comes to professionals, it's rare that someone really has a clue on what's going on. Most aren't shaming or anything, but they don't really get it either. It's a blessing when someone does, though. I had a incredible psychologist once who had a pretty good understanding within a few minutes and actually tried helping me without putting me down in any way. 
I feel like society doesn't care at all if I am honest. I do agree that people are shamed for being ill though, mainly out of ignorance but I always feel as if ignorance can only be sustained when a person doesn't care to learn or open themselves up to deeper understanding of why things (eg. people not working because of illness) happen.
Yes, society shames not just mental illness (excused with it being poorly understood), but also poverty, addiction, or any other sort of perceived weakness. It's not just your feeling, it's a sociological fact. 
It's a complex and multi-faceted issue. I think part of it that often folks don't see or can't see the condition of an internal psychological injury that doesn't display physical symptoms with direct, obvious causes. For example people may not be very aware of what "depression" is, that when a person is suffering they may go into a low-energy state, let-alone know what causes it or how to react appropriately to it. They may essentially informally "misdiagnose" you, and thus improperly attribute your symptoms to some other false-cause.  The person that is limping appears to be dragging their feet.

"Misdiagnosing" someone could be considered equivalent to treating someone as "well" when they are in fact "ill" or injured. It is not hard to see the folly and potential for compounding injury that can cause. It is only hard to see internal injuries. 
As with any illness, the appropriate course of action is to ascertain what is wrong and use therapeutic environments and healing practices to help make them "well". But this may not happen unless a person is diagnosed accurately. 

Another facet of the issue is that many people in society, including well-intentioned people that are goal-oriented, industrious, prosperous, and ambitious, may hold a view is that individuals are strictly supposed to support society rather than have society support them.  When a person is misdiagnosed or doesn't get effective treatment, then the condition becomes "chronic" by default.  An undiagnosed, "chronic" internal condition may tend to wear thin the patience of these people.  

This view is that individuals are strictly supposed to support society rather than society supporting them seems to be one of the fundamental principles and core beliefs that society is built on.  During times when everyone is healthy and well, perhaps that view is obvious and self-evident.  However, at times when people are ill but others can't or don't see it, perhaps it is surprising at times just how fundamental and over-riding that core-belief can seem to be. It's this notion that if you can't find a place in society to fit-in and take on a contributory role in order for you to be accepted by a community, then ostensibly you haven't contributed enough to society for society to owe you anything.  I think there is truth to that but it isn't the whole truth.  There are also important values and qualities in society for nurturing and mentoring people, healing the sick, being charitable and philanthropic, investing in people's health and education. 

The difficulty is that as with any "investment", one never knows for sure whether a patient will recover or not, or by how much. There will always be some risk of lost effort. It is that way with any endeavor. But certainly it is perceived as risky to embark on treatment and therapeutic endeavors for someone with an unknown, misdiagnosed, poorly-understood condition with inadequate treatments. lol. 

Sometimes society turns away from the mentally ill for the same reason that the mentally ill turn away from society, in order to conserve energy and in an effort to try to make wiser, less risky and more fruitful choices with one's time and energy. 

Perhaps we can find better ways. If accountability needs to be placed, perhaps it can be shifted onto traumatic events in a person's life or the challenges of reaching an accurate diagnosis or the challenges of therapy and healing.  Perhaps it can be framed positively and inspire others if one expresses their condition as temporary rather than chronic, and expresses their desire to be well so that one day they can reach their hopes, dreams and aspirations.  

I think it's naturally easier to deny something you can't "see", which is also what makes the process of change in therapy so difficult and arduous at times. 
It's absolutely stigmatized in every way shape and form. That's why you have to be really careful about who you trust with your information. It doesn't help either when you start to judge yourself.

I was lucky in that I had an understanding workplace (I opened up after 3 years of erratic attendance and behavior despite working quite hard when healthy), and also an understanding partner (who has even judged me once or twice in the last 3 years when frustrated with me, despite being overall wholly understanding and supportive).

The fact, though, is that it's really for the individual to deal with their own mental health. It took 3 years of concerted effort on myh own part to get through my anxiety and depression, but I did it. I have plenty of sympathy for those struggling, but am also torn when seeing others making poor decisions that contribute to it. Being judgmental is even a struggle for me now that I'm healthy, albeit I've always been kind of judgmental about one particular family member.
exactly, that is how i feel. except everybody else is showing by there actions otherwise. and it makes me think mabey its just me. even though deep down i feel like i am right. it really makes me mad. sorry for the rant
Sometimes I get this scary surreal feeling when I think about how weird it really is to be alive, conscious and able to think. The fact that I'm sitting here at a computer, staring at a screen, on planet earth, is just extremely weird. A couple of times these thoughts have become unsettling, but I'm able to shake it off.

Have anyone else experienced this?
These thoughts are the sign of a higher intelligence in a species, woo go us, but as someone who has really spiralled downwards because of those kinds of thoughts and others I've gotta say, practice mindfulness now before you feel like you're just a guy peering into a kind of blurry fuzzy not really there window, I would feel really unsettled like that after having existential panic attacks. Yikes!
Take a look into [Depersonalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization).  I think our consciousness is often at odds with the increased amount of free time to consider these things, and the fact that our "hardware" (our bodies) are meant to be around for 30-50 years and our "software" (our minds) are becoming more and more developed and full of information.  

Anyone suffering from anxiety due to these considerations I would suggest taking some time out of your day to enjoy silence, or connection with nature.  Staring into blue flickering lights and sitting around a lot I think has a great cumulative effect on our subconscious.  

Be well. 
I rarely consider my consciousness, but sometimes I will look at myself in the mirror and remember, "Oh right, that's you." 
Yes.

Fairly regularly.

Used to be more about dissociation, and thus of disturbance. 

Now it's more related to mystery and leaping off the edge of self. Less disturbance, but still pretty weird :-)
Yes. Very much yes.

I think this is my first post in this sub.

You belong in r/psychonaut :)
Absolutely. As in what purpose do we serve here. How can a race of organisms start from scratch and eventually lead up to what we are today and everything around us that we built/created. How did we stay alive and conscious for so long without dying and going extinct. Man could never imagine being in the position we are in now in the year 2016 with all the endless possibilities you can make of yourself, your health, your surroundings and your future. Man would never thing you can discuss such a thing like this on the internet, which is a complete different scary surreal notion. Like you, whenever I overthink one of these concepts and I run out of stuff to make up to explain it, I also just shake it off. (or at least try too, until it comes back again shortly after)
Yes, it's weird. It gets weirder when sit and really think about how unlikely it all is. Everything lining up so that I can sit here and communicate with you via a world wide set of networks is so unlikely, yet here we are.  


Yeah, sometimes i get feelings quite similar to yours. Like why am i on this particular planet? Why in this particular body? And how it seems funny that a few billion years of evolution eventually led to us commenting this thread...
Ditto.
Here here, well said, keep your hands and your mind busy. And stop staring blankly into screens!  

My landline phone makes me want to kill myself #BellLetsTalk
So it's just a given these are mental health initiatives we would all agree with and support?
Yep, if you put Bell's name and an indicator of their service "Let's Talk" in front of all of your friends and followers on twitter (let's say you have 500) they'll pay 5 cents. 

Now, unless you specifically say this is a mental health initiative and that they're supporting specific charities, all you've done is cost them $0.05 cents to raise their brand awareness to 500 people.  Most of your followers won't even know this is a mental health initiative targetted at "Workplace Depression Prevention".

So, let's not bother.  Let Bell get their advertising for the cost of advertising, not off a trivial donation to charities that help them more than anyone else (as they're a huge employer in Canada).

I think this is one of the most personal articles that I've ever seen David Wong write
Just like reading about myself. See you soon R.Williams.
Great article thanks :)

There should be monsters for the meds too. Seroquel could be this fat blob that sleeps all the time.  Xanax could have huge pupils and be numb.  Lithium could be shaking.  Lamictal could have a rash all over.  Adderal could look like some strung out sonic the hedgehog.
I've seen this posted around reddit before. While I understand the thought behind it, I don't like the thought that mental illnesses are monsters. I'm not a monster, and neither are my diagnoses. My Borderline personalty disorder, anxiety, OCD, etc. are part of what makes me, me. They aren't always negative. In fact, I appreciate my BPD because it allows me to be very empathetic and it allows me to feel happiness, excitement, wonder, and amazement on a level that most people will never experience. My OCD allows me to be a perfectionist when making art, and let's me create things I am truly proud of, things that other people admire. My anxiety allows me to be in a state of heightened awareness, which has saved me from being in dangerous situations multiple times. 
Idk. I guess I just see mental illness as multifaceted 
A social stigma monster would be a worthwhile addition.
I don't feel that the artist is saying people with mental illnesses are monsters. He states on his website that he was inspired to do to cope with his own mental illness. 

If you feel that way you should write it down. Apart from ordering your thoughts it will also provide a guide when going to your therapist. What's written down is worth talking about.
I'm with you on that. I feel like I can relate to that even with my parents when I come home from work and they ask how I'm doing. I don't remember a day I didn't say "fine".
Same here. It takes me a while to warm up to it when I do want to talk about it and usually that's not till the last 15 minutes of a meeting :(
I am exactly the same way! I started keeping a journal and it really helps me organize my feelings when I see all the symptoms laid out on paper.  Don't worry about having to write in it every day, just write often enough to see patterns in the way you feel. 
thanks, I'm going to try that.
I know how you feel, I'm always quiet the first half hour in.
great idea, seems a lot of people keep these journals, I'm going to start one up.


Really good article. People are always saying "don't let your mental illness define you". Okay anxiety is not me. But it's a big part of me. Even like it says there, I was in a relationship in all of my early 20s, pretty sure that was a big part of my life as well. And things like that make you who you are.
That being said, I'm now mid 20s and no clue who I am but can't fight that both of those things have to do with it. Kinda wonder who I was prior to that
I dunno, I often hold things back from people. Some people are just assholes. You need to know who to share things with, not everyone is going to treat you kindly. 
I wish I wasnt like this, and im trying to change. But being "mentally ill" is so lonely. It feels so damn lonely.

Like in movies and tv shows like mr robot they show mental illness as a challenge and people who go through it badasses. But its not like that. I wish it was.

Like when you feel depressed or anxious or whatever, it doesnt give you the same thing you think it would give you from movies and tv shows. Like this empowering, exciting feeling. It feels really, really lonely. It feels like you're the only person on earth sometimes. And it can be really, really scary too.
I found loneliness was worse the better my mental health was. At rock bottom I didn't care I had no one because I didn't care about anything it was just numbness. It was once I started improving in every aspect of my life I started questioning if it was a facade, since if I were so much more evolved than old me, why am I still lonely?
You don't need a mental illness to feel lonely. When you feel lonely realize you're just on the down side of the seesaw.  You'll be up again.  If you really think about it - happy days are meaningless without bad days.  Same with moods, health and everything else.  Accept yourself as you are. TV isn't remotely real regarding mental illness. The only badass thing about it is working to get better by surviving everyday as a decent person.  If you want friends you gotta be a friend.  Enough aphorisms for you?
Almost everything that is shown in tv or movies isn't accurate. 
What kind of mental disorder do you have?
You are not the only one. Just keep moving. Reach out if you want to talk about it
All illnesses are really lonely. 
You are not alone, you are supported by tons of people who love you. I find that just getting out and moving around really helps. Try walking around your neighborhood to see if that helps.
Totally agree. It is lonely. The worse my mental health, the more I isolate. And if it's getting down to rock bottom, I can't even manage basic human interactions. 
That's an awful feeling to have. This isn't exactly related, but I use to struggle with joining groups of people. Like if a group of people were standing around talking, I felt that I shouldn't join them. 

One tip I used was, in my head I tell myself that those people like me. I simply assume that and it changes how I interact with them. This has greatly improved my ability to connect with people.

Anyway, I hope you find your groove in this interesting place. 
I think you know that's a side effect of some kind of traumatisation by society. I used to think I was crazy for not wanting "friends" and for not wanting to go to parties. I thought that that was part of my depression. Turns out it wasn't! That's just what I'm like. We genuinely have a very unique self inside. We've just been made to feel like it's the wrong self and things like modern psychology just work to fix the superficial aspects. Were taught to just imitate a healthy person. And I don't know about Mr Robot because most of that show is just him hallucinating. Like in fight club. So they show them as like a delicate flower but nobody wants to be that. Like, have you seen "a beautiful mind", that shit's messed up yo! 
I have been getting treatment for major depression for 8 years, I have voluntarily cut myself off from other people mostly out of consideration for them. I noticed how my depression was affecting those around me so I decided it was for the best that I'm not around people. 
Yes. Lonely.
I used to get really bummed when my SO would post about being lonely every day on fb when i was trying my hardest to help. Then i developed my own mental health issues and really gained some understanding. Its an intense feeling hey? Ive learned to really make the most of the little interactions i have. Being present whenever i order coffee from someone doesnt always mean im going to be met with the same open-ness, but sometimes i will.. And the practice is good anyway. Being nice to people gives them a reason to be nice back. And thats not a lonely thing. Also when theyre not friendly.. Well thats just practice for how to not take other peoples actions so personally. Does this help at all? 
/r/UnnecessaryQuotes
alot, I dont agree with those labels, but I think its a combination of bipolar and schizophrenia 
damn, are you better or worse before treatment
Get yourself diagnosed if you haven't yet. I highly recommend it. There are a lot of uncommon illnesses that may also be diagnosed to certain people. Please, seek help. You need it. Everyone needs it. 
You think or your therapist or doctor thinks? If you have self diagnosed, you need to actually go and get diagnosed...


Better, but only for a limited amount of time.

Would have
I have had low self esteem my whole life since middle school and I find that I automatically jump to negative conclusions about what people think of something I said or did. Now that I have become more aware of this issue, I believe it has created a self-fulfilling prophecy for me over the years by acting in ways that made people like me less only because I believed that they disliked me.

Now I am in a fraternity at my university and I am feeling the same way all over again; something I was trying to move on from the start. I feel left out and feel like my efforts to mold into the group have failed. I am just looking to work towards shifting this whole unconscious negative mindset that is limiting in my ability to be socially content and happy. The question is how? It seems like nothing works no matter who I am with or where I am. Some days are so good that I feel on top of the world and invincible to any kind of negative force but that is very rare.

 
Hey, I understand. After high school, I "vowed" to never allow myself to be treated that way again (you can assume it wasn't good). That vow has really cost me. I can't let go. People that screwed me over years ago still rent space in my brain attic. It's a horrible place to live. 

We need to get you to a better place. Is it your logical brain that goes straight to the negative? Or is it the emotional side? 
What helped me was changing my thought patterns , when I would think "they probably thought what I said was stupid" I would think "hey that's a self depriving thought and it isn't doing me any good. They don't care about what I said and if they did it's none of my business" or more briefly "yo no they don't" and even if I don't believe it if I keep saying it eventually I automatically will dismiss the thought 
"If one was regularly neglected, ignored, abandoned, discounted, disclaimed, and rejected -- as well as invalidated, confused, betrayed, insulted, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, ridiculed, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, dumped on, bullied, scapegoated, and/or otherwise abused -- by others upon whom they depended for survival in early life, and/or they are highly stressed by school, work, relationships or other chronic life challenges, they may have been programmed, conditioned, socialized and/or normalized to various beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be, and then beat themselves up for not being able to meet their expectations and requirements."

The rigors of college and frat life often re-trigger the mental states of earlier stressors. If you relate to that description above, here's a research-proven road map out of the jungle:

1) Substance Abuse: IF one is using alcohol, nicotine in any form, or other substances, they'll have to stop. SA can cause -- or worsen -- this in people with specific genetics and behavioral conditioning (see below). [Alcoholics Anonymous]( http://www.aa.org/), [Marijuana Anonymous]( https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/) and/or [Narcotics Anonymous]( https://www.na.org/) can be helpful. Or using the [SAMHSA facility locator]( https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) online to find a detox & rehab. 

2) If one is NOT doing the above, they may need lab work to determine if they have hormonal (e.g.: thyroid) or metabolic (e.g.: low Vitamin D3) imbalances. See a competent MD, DO, PA or NP. (To find one in your area, use the clinician locators mentioned below or get a referral from your GP/PC doc.)

3) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do next seven things on this list: Find a board certified psychopharmacologist in your area by using the physician locators below. Getting psych meds from a GP or primary care doc can be useless or even risky. Psych diagnoses, meds and med interactions are just too complex now for most GPs and primary care docs.

4) Support Groups: [Adult Children of Alcoholics / Dysfunctional Families](http://www.adultchildren.org/) (ACA), [Emotions Anonymous]( http://emotionsanonymous.org/) (EA), and *especially* [Codependents Anonymous]( http://coda.org/) (CoDA)... where you will find others in similar boats who have found explanations, answers and solutions. All of their websites have meeting locators.

5) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). Strongly recommended because they all understand the upshots of having been stressed into fight, flight or freeze for too long, including complex PTSD: Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine, Patricia Ogden, Ronald Kurtz, Laurence Heller, Bruce McEwen, Sonya Lupien and Robert Sapolsky. Look for an online article entitled "[Treat Autonomic AND Cognitive Conditions in Psychopathology?](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/treat-autonomic-and-cognitive.html)" to get you oriented. *Accurate* information is power.

6) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden's Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T) as the "interoceptive" 9th of [The 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to manage any C-PTSD time bombs that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the 

. . . a) cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking,  and Schema Therapy; the 

. . . b) "super" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR); and the

. . . c) "deep cleaners" like Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

One can look up all of those by name online. The CBTs deconstruct one's inaccurate beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be.  DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc. 

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look on the "therapists" and "psychiatrists" sections of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, or the "find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry" section of the WebMD website; the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator, and -- for DBT specialists in particular -- on the Behavioraltech.org website. If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often excellent sources of referral.

7) Mindfulness Meditation: Try the Vipassana or Theravada Meditation styles? (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, unwanted mania and depression, this stuff handles them all chop chop. Many of the modern "mindfulness"-based psychotherapies are actually based on these now.) The article "The Feeling is Always Temporary" at pairadocks.blogspot.com provides a nice summation of it.

8) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks built on CBT, ACT, DBT, MBBT and MBCT workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=DBT+therapy+workbooks).
 
9) Moderate Exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to "massage" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.

10) Diet: A lot of people with depression, mania and/or anxiety eat *very* poorly. Junk food -- not to mention too *little* nutritious food -- will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse. High-quality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind, but HQ *fresh* (especially Mediterranean -- though not *pizza* -- and Asian) food appears to be best for pts with C-PTSD symptoms. *Healthy* fats in moderation, btw, are known to be good for depression. Add a 1000 IU soft gel of Vitamin D3, too.

Of the ten, #3 and #6 are the only ones that cost much, and several are totally free.

Rather than trying to get other people to like you, work on liking yourself, and the rest should fall into place.

This will probably be difficult for you to read, but there's a chance that some of them don't like you. But that's life – not everybody will.

I've struggled with this myself and still do. What you need to do is to learn to stop caring about the opinion of people who don't matter. This is going to be hard, because it's going to involve honestly looking at your relationships and deciding which ones really matter, and which ones don't. It's hard, really hard, but it'll make you a lot happier in the long-run.

Tl;dr: you're a great person, and anyone who doesn't like you isn't worth your time anyway. Focus on the people who do like you.

It is definitely the emotional side. I have a tendency to feel before think and usually when I become consciously aware of it, things do get better. You may have just helped me answer my own question. Maybe the solution is to practice being more logical about each situation I am put into when I am thinking negatively. Of course easier said than done.
I wish I could get into therapy but it's much more complicated 
I'm the hyper logical type and I have found most humans can't deal with pure logic. I've spent years trying to think with "both brains - emotional & logical"... Take both sides into account. It's really hard and takes time. I hope things work out better for you. 
Thanks you too
Man I wish I could help :(

This was a glimpse into depression but didn't cover so many more aspects. 
I completely agree. I just thought it was an interesting example of how depression is portrayed on film.
I thought she was possibly bipolar II; high flying career, impetuous decisions, followed by crushing depression — must watch again.
Yesterday I saw a girl get up on a chair and lean over to look down over the ledge of a terrace at my school (8 floors up). I go over with the only other person on the terrace at the time and ask her what's going on. She's crying, won't answer my questions, and starts climbing over the rail. Very long story short, she ends up on the other side of the rail standing on the ledge 8 floors above a very busy Manhattan sidewalk with both of us holding onto her pleading with her to come back over. Comes to a point where the only thing holding her on the ledge is our hands and she is PULLING from us trying to fall. Finally a janitor walks by and calls security. The first one to respond grabbed her legs and we all lifted her back to the terrace. 

This was yesterday and I'm still playing it over and over and over in my head, thinking about if one or both of us weren't there when we were, how no one from the street even looked up and noticed us, how hard she fought us and how much she wanted to die. I just can't get it out of my head. I'm terrified of going back on the terrace now and I've been a little obsessed with googling other suicides at my school (and yeah, one was a jump from that same fucking terrace) and at the same time I just feel so guilty because while I KNOW I did the right thing and she'll have the chance to get help, it felt strange to save someone fighting so hard to not be saved. And I'm scared for her. I'm just so shaken up. And I can't sleep.

I've tried googling for personal accounts from anyone else who might have been in the same situation I was and I can't find anything. Anyone else experience something like this before? Is it strange I'm having such a hard time even though I wasn't even the one on the ledge?
First of all, kudos to you for doing the right thing at the right time.

>Is it strange I'm having such a hard time even though I wasn't even the one on the ledge? 

It is not at all strange. It is pretty common for someone who's witnessed a suicide attempt (completed or not) to receive counseling for it and I would strongly recommend that you talk with your school counselor (if high school), the counseling office at your school (if college), or in some other way find some assistance through this time. 

>I just feel so guilty because while I KNOW I did the right thing and she'll have the chance to get help, it felt strange to save someone fighting so hard to not be saved.

I'd also like to comment on this. Something that really struck home to me a while back was a quote "The majority of people who feel suicidal do not actually want to die; they do not want to live the life they have." 
It is very normal to be rattled by such an upsetting thing, OP. You saved a life!
Haven't ever saved anyone, but I've been saved. 
I'm still struggling. I still think about trying again. I still want to die pretty often. But never once have I been upset with or regretted being around the people who kept me alive. On good or bad days, I can understand that they thought they were doing the right thing, regardless of what I wanted. And the simple fact that they thought they were doing something good gives me a little faith. Like maybe there are some people who don't just *say* they care- they really do. 
I can assure you, even if she doesn't appreciate what you did right now, there will be days she does. Hopefully, a lot of them. 
Talk to a school counselor. You're experience [post traumatic stress](https://www.ozarkcenter.com/clients/recognizing-post-traumatic-stress). This is normal and it's important to seek assistance if you're truly bothered, which you are. Don't bottle it up.
Someone posted something the other day about finding someone that hung themselves cuz he worked in a prison and it happened in the persons cell. He wasn't able to save him. But he definitely tried. I guess just try to focus on the fact that even though it was scary, something good came out of it and you saved a life. I told him maybe he should find a new job and he is. But for some people you can never know when you're gonna run into something like that. It's good you did the right thing.
I'm in college and my school set me up with a counselor less than 24 hours after I gave my statement which actually impressed me. It just worries me I can't find many accounts from people who were in a similar situation. Kind of feel alone in this, you know?
You did the right thing.  I went through something similar not too long ago.

I worked at a psychiatric hospital where we do 15-min safety checks on every patient.  There was a young woman who I had pretty good rapport with. She and I had spent an hour or more talking 1:1 multiple times. 

One evening, I was doing rounds and she was sitting on the floor in her room, coloring.  She smiled and waved at me.  <15 minutes later I come back and I didn't see her immediately, so I poked my head into the room and she was still sitting in the floor, but out of view (because of the door).   Again, she smiled at me.  

The next time I came around, I again couldn't see her so I poked my head around the door.  She was hanging from the top of the doorframe of the bathroom.  We had doors specifically designed to prevent this. She had tied her clothes together and tied them around the base of the toilet, wedged them up over the door, and tied around her neck.   She was still alive and I rushed in to get her down.  One of the most terrifying moments of my life because I honestly didn't know in that moment that she was still with us.   We go her sittimg down on the ground. When she regained her composure she was very angry. She grabbed my pen and tried to stab me with it, then tried to dig it into her on arm.  She was  screaming at me, Furious that I had stopped her. 

It definitely impacted my emotions heavily. I was consumed by thoughts of it for quite some time. Every time I opened a patient's door I thought I was going to walk in on that again. Everytime I closed my eyes I saw her there hanging, I heard her there screaming at me.  The day after, I finally had a moment to sit and process it and I just burst into tears. I sobbed uncontrollably for hours on end.   It definitely helped me to talk about it with people who were supportive, but it might just take some time. I know my situation is a little different than yours, but I think the same thing applies. You did the right thing. You save someone's life.  It's totally normal for you to be feeling weird about it.  Hang in there. 
*hugs*

You did a great thing. 

I hope you never know what it’s like to wake up and wish you hadn’t.  Not because you’re tired and you want another few minutes of sleep; not because you’re hungover; not because it’s Monday and you don’t want to go to work.

I mean you wake up, and you realise tomorrow came – and it’s not a good feeling. I mean you wake up and you open your eyes, only to close them right away and silently will yourself away from it all.  I mean you wake up and you are disappointed that you didn’t, by some miracle, die in your sleep.

Quite simply, I mean waking up is just a reminder that you haven’t escaped your life yet.  You’re still here.  And I hope you never understand what it’s like to wish you weren’t here.

I hope you never understand what it’s like to be unable to get out of bed.   Not physically – because physically, you are capable.  Your legs work.  Your heart is beating.  But I hope you never understand what it’s like to be unable to move simply because your thoughts are crippling you.  I hope you never understand what it’s like to be held in place, stuck there, battling with yourself within your own mind.  Swing that leg out and touch the floor.  Take a step.  Get out of the bed.

I hope you never understand what it’s like to forget what happiness feels like.  I hope you never feel like there’s no way out of your sadness.  I hope you never get overcome by numbness.  I hope you never experience that feeling of pure emptiness.  I hope you never feel like there is nothing good, or bad, coming around the corner.  I hope you never feel like you can’t imagine there being a future for you.  

I hope you never need to rely on people to remind you to eat.

I hope you never need to rely on people to remind you to sleep, or to be awake.

I hope you never need to rely on people to remind you to take your multiple medications on a daily basis.

I hope you never, ever need to rely on people to hide all the sharp knives in the house so you can’t get ahold of them to hurt yourself.

I hope you never, ever need to be checked on every time you take a bath, just because there’s a chance you’re trying to drown yourself.

I hope you never know what it’s like to not be trusted near open windows.

I hope you never have to convince yourself not to jump in front of the train as it approaches on the platform.

I hope you never understand what it means to be afraid of opening the front door and stepping out into the real world.

I hope you never have to force yourself to appear normal and happy when all you want to do is run and hide, and never come out.

I hope you never understand what it feels like to worry that everyone in the world is against you.

I really hope you never understand what it means to feel completely alone while you’re surrounded by people.

I really, really hope you never understand what it means to want to end it all.

I do hope you understand that you can’t always understand.

I do hope you understand that you don’t need to understand.

I hope you understand that you can’t fix everything.

I hope you understand that no one thinks you can, and no one is expecting you to.

I think you do understand that no one knows the battles other people are fighting.

I think you do understand that we all have our own stories.

I think you understand that we don’t need to understand each other to support each other, and to love each other, and to wish the very best for each other.

I think you can see that all anyone has ever wanted is to be accepted.

So, stand by me.  Lie next to me.  Sit with me.  Talk to me.   Stay silent.  Hold my hand or smile at me.  Tell me you’re with me and that everything will be okay, someday.  It might not be now.  I know that.  I might be hurting for a long time.  I might be numb for a long time.  I might be happy for a long time, and I might feel myself falling down the tunnel again.

So just tell me you’ll stay with me and you’ll protect me from myself, because that’s who I’m most afraid of.

Tell me you’ll hang out with me until the storm passes.  And then, once it has, hang out with me some more.

You don’t have to understand me.  I don’t want you to know what this is like, because I know it’s awful, and that’s enough.  I don’t want you to know it for yourself.

I just want to know that you’re here with me.
Awesome. Thank you for sharing.
Powerful stuff, and means a lot to me to read it. Honestly, this belongs on a greeting card. I will definitely share this with those close to me. 
That's very deep. And was so sad until I got farther down and read where you said the parts that you hope others do understand, and that they don't need to be going through it or to completely grasp it to still be there for one another. <3
Thank you so much.
I know what a lot of this is like. Frankly, I think it would be good if people did know what it was like, just for a little bit. I don't feel like that now exactly, but I remember, I will never forget. It is in a way still a vein in me, and I want to remember. Many on here know what it's like, unfortunately. 

There are those who try to help and don't understand. But I hope you never meet those who throw their ball at you and expect you to catch it or who roll their eyes when you literally have to leave and can't play their games, what ever they are. I imagine you know what I mean though. I wish some could know what that's like, what they are really dealing with. And dumping on and making use of and sticking things into.

Shoving things into. Thanks for shoving that in. *Need that in there...*

*Let's shove this in there. Doesn't seem to fit. Cram it. Shove that in too.*

*They seem fine.*

*Oh they're ok.*

*I don't want to hear about it.*

*Bullshit!*

And my two favorites:

*Well, that may be true.*

*But too bad!*

*Too bad!*

So many things shoved in.


Hauntingly beautiful and eye opening. Thank you for that. 
<3
thank you.
i write about stuff like this a lot.  it helps me to get things out, and the feedback i get is the best part.  i never realised that opening up would help so many people.

if you want to check out some more of my stuff, have a look at 23brokeandhappy on wordpress.  i usually post something once or twice a week.
thank youuuu!!
oh, i know what you mean.
i've had job offers taken away when ive been open about my history.  i've had people accuse me of making shit up to avoid responsibilty.  i've had people laugh me off too many times to count.
it's hard to imagine having an illness when you can't physically see the symptoms.
for me, understanding that some people will never understand, has only helped me be more accepting of it all.

Wow. "Schizophrenic" who manages to land a date and go to a public event. Why the fuck is this an article?
This is just beautiful!

>Shaffer (1999) found that 90% of children and adolescents suffer from mental illness or have committed suicide.

Correction: Shaffer (1999) found that 90% of children and adolescents who have committed suicide suffered from mental illness. [Source.](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/13218258_Methods_of_adolescent_suicide_prevention) 

I do like the idea of teaching mental health in schools. They just got their words mixed up there and formed a misleading sentence.
I suffer from mental health problems and would like to state the obvious here to anyone at the beginning of the position I got myself into.

I made a major change in my life moving to a new area. Things were good, I exposed myself to anxious situations, I tried my best to socialize even though my world was continuing to fall apart, I put a smile on my depressive face and was recovering quite well.

The past few weeks I just began to live in my room, minimal social contact with people outside of it, took depression and anxiety hard and disappeared into the internet.

This is never the way to go, but old habits die hard now I'm almost back in the position I started from, the long way I came is almost completely gone and I'm heading back to square one.

To anyone else who is having a crap time and just wants to withdraw from the world DON'T DO IT. Your recovery is far more important than a temporary escape.

/rant

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes, although a lot are posting disagreements with me, I can at least see the majority agrees.

EDIT2: I have been doing a lot today, this has forced me to talk to shop assistance's, things are getting better already, I think this shows that once I get to a point and relapse it's easier to return to where I was rather than starting from scratch.
Go out and find [one of these](http://imgur.com/fgRKU), [or this one](http://i.imgur.com/fZ9RF.gif).  
I find that even on my most 'away' days, my pets bring me back. I keep telling myself they are not allowed to suffer for my depression.
But the outside is terrible. I honestly, legitimately hate it. It's hot, 90 degrees most days and about as humid. I still go out a little but I have no car, and nothing besides swimming in my apartment pool is free. I am hoping I'll be able to get a car soon, but for the moment, as someone living in a stinky, ugly suburban sprawl just outside Orland, I have no idea why I should leave the house unless I absolutely have to.
Wishing you all the best in your progress. I truly hope that in time you will be comfortable in social situations that may seem scary or overwhelming. Can I ask what gave you the strength to come out of your room? What made you come to the conclusion that isolating yourself was moving backwards? 

My brother also suffers from mental health issues. In spending time & having conversations with him, I see that he is slowly reverting back to isolating himself in his room to watch movies, playing video games & just preferring to stay in, avoiding people in general. It seems like he is experiencing an  increase in social anxiety, stopped spending time with his friends & is reluctant to doing anything new. I have tried to encourage him to keep up with the hobbies he does enjoy & have even asked him over many times to hang out just so he is not alone. I know this is not something he will fully recover from. What can I do to support him & urge him to not live in his room? I would really appreciate some insight based on your experience. Is this something you had to do on your own or did anyone/anything motivate you to believe you could get better?
Also, I've discovered rearranging furniture in my room or decorating it differently helps from time to time. I associate previous lows of mine with my bedroom, which sometimes makes me not even want to sleep in there! On those days, I stick to the couch, which isn't a healthy solution. Don't live in your room, but also don't make it a toxic place to be when it's time to be there.

Not taking care of my cats due to severe depression was one of my lows (worse than my suicide attempts/hospitalization,) and is one of my most shameful acts. Really showed me how low I had gone and motivated me.
What about when it cools down a little. You need to go outside and associate with people, find something to do, pick up an outdoor hobby and don't use the weather as as excuse.

Isolating yourself is never the answer.

Posting in this subreddit I'd assume you have mental health problems, would you leave the house once the weather settles?
>Can I ask what gave you the strength to come out of your room? What made you come to the conclusion that isolating yourself was moving backwards? 

I have known for a long time but sometimes I'm helpless to stop it, my life fell apart recently with friends etc, and I also discovered I meet the criteria for a bipolar diagnosis. It's quite overwhelming but I try and keep plugging along.

Since moving to a new place I realized how sever my problems really were and how they will affect my life for years to come. The suicidal thoughts constantly running through my head have made me say that I should at least try to make my life worth living.

When I was younger I was pulled out of my room constantly by friends and formed an active although not perfect social life. 

> What can I do to support him & urge him to not live in his room?

You can constantly try and get him out, expose him to social situations, take him out with friends etc, but if he doesn't feel comfortable and simply keeps saying no then maybe it's too big of a step.

People can be natural introverts but shyness and introversion aren't the same, anxiety is not on the same track at all.

Another way is to tell him other peoples stories, how they realized that ignoring their mental health only made it worse, like myself. (I'm in my mid 20's now)

I'm not just anxious, actually the anxiety is nothing compared to what it was, but it's still present and comes and goes. It's the mood swings which get me the most. Depression and anxiety seem to run in sync so when I get depressed I get anxious.

The best way to overcome anxiety is through cognitive behavioral therapy, you challenge unhelpful thought processes in your head or writing them down.

If it's really sever you expose yourself to anxious situations stepping up to different levels and challenging the thoughts as you go. I'm glad I was never this bad but some people can't catch public transport, walk down the street, etc. If he is especially bad he doesn't want jump into the deep end (embarrassing situations can make it worse)

/r/socialanxiety can help your brother a lot. I have read many good things on there.

Meditation can play a part in learning how to block thoughts out of your mind and relax. There is a specific type of meditation called mindfullness used in cognitive behavioral therapy.

He also needs to find other ways to boost self confidence, although it doesn't work well for me most people say that putting on some extra muscle, fitness and losing weight helps them. Eating healthy is a must.
What do you mean 'let your guard down'

The next thing you need to do is learn how to not give a fuck what others think.

Read the reply I made to baens604
You should give it another chance, don't let isolation take over you. One day you will realize that it is important.

Soon after I isolated myself I was just living with no life, work, eat, gym, sleep. It sucked, I was lonley, but I could deal with it. Then something happened to me, even though I suffered initially with it the wake up call was well overdue.

Don't let yourself grow old and realize what a social life means to you, there is plenty of support on other subreddits to learn social skills, deal with anxiety etc. it doesn't need to consume all your time set some aside each day or week to get back on your feet, you're better than this.

>I don't want to struggle and endure the failures any more. 

Struggle is a way of life, we need to struggle and make mistakes to learn and gain the experiences we get, it makes us stronger people.
I used to, back when I lived in a place with natural beauty and passing seasons. Here even when it cools off, which is only during winter, there's still no reason to go very far, especially if don't have much money to spend. Everything about this place is flat and ugly, while the people who live here are round and rude.

Why do you think it's never okay to isolate yourself? That seems kind of dogmatic, and in my experience just plainly not true. I spend way too much time in isolation sure, I want to change that and I will, but the most I can see myself doing here is attending a community college, and that wouldn't be socialize, it'd be to learn about stuff I'm interested in. If I can get a car, I'll explore, I'll visit historical sites and libraries. Anything else in this area would be harmful to me.


Thank you for your thoughtful advice. I will definitely use your examples to persuade him to leave his room/house & take steps to improve his self confidence. When he was in University, he was more comfortable with people, speaking in public, etc.. But since graduating 2 yrs ago, he is not forced to walk through crowds of students, speak to people he doesn't know, etc.. he has regressed back to his comfort zone of never leaving the house. 

I gave him some summer "homework" to work on. I had hoped that having it down on paper, as well as a copy on his phone, would be a tangible reminder of things that he can actively work on when he is not feeling good about himself. Also, he can always use it as a reference on his phone, (sort of security blanket), when feels overwhelmed or nervous when he is not at home. 

Pt 1: What are some things you can do to combat your anxiety & when he hears voices in his head?  These can be things he learned in CBT, visualization techniques, etc.

Pt 2: A checklist of actions that make him reset when can't focus on the task he is working on. Kind of a reset to "0" when he is overwhelmed or the voices in his head seem louder than the the one that is his.

Pt 3: Things that he wants to learn about, skills he wants to conquer. I know a long-term goal of his is to move out of my mom's house so some of these include basic life skills stuff like cooking simple meals to ones that will take time like learning a new language. 

I have been reading your comments below & it sounds like you are struggling through a difficult time. I agree with you that it is more constructive to face the issue head on rather than ignoring it. Your life IS worth living. It may be hard day to day but in a year from now, you will see how much adversity you have overcome & how much you have grown. The harder the challenge, the sweeter the reward. Keep going!! Don't give up!

>Why do you think it's never okay to isolate yourself?

Humans are social creatures, we need to associate with others to keep ourselves happy. It is a very important part of our existants.

To be in the best state of health you need to keep fit, eat well and socialize.

How are you ever going to find a partner without associating with people?

Take control of your problems don't let them take control of you.

You are posting in mental health subreddit so something has to be wrong, you know something isn't quite right but I don't think you quite have the right idea on how to fix it.

If there are other problems which stop you from breaking out of the isolation trap see if you can tackle them first. Fitness and health can help raise your mood and make you more confident, as can changing the way you think (The basis behind cognative behavioural theropy).

I'm not in your situation therefore I can't tell you exactly what to do and how to do it, you need to figure that out for yourself.
Socialization is one of the most common tips given to people with mental illness. I don't think it's a dogmatic point of view. When one isolates one's self,it's very easy to let one's problems take control. Getting out helps most people with mental health issues.
You should refer your brother to Reddit, there are lots of fokes around here who are willing to help him along the way, he can ask questions and get good answers from people who are going through the same thnigs or have overcome what he is expierencing.

>When he was in University, he was more comfortable with people, speaking in public, etc.. But since graduating 2 yrs ago, he is not forced to walk through crowds of students, speak to people he doesn't know, etc.. he has regressed back to his comfort zone of never leaving the house. 

Sounds a lot like my situation, although I never went to univercity. When I put myself in a position of social isolation (Kind of had to) things went downhill fast. Pulling myself out of it was about 2 weeks worth of stressful situations which I wouldn't recomend but it got better although not completly.

>when he hears voices in his head?

I hope you mean when he hears thoughts in his head. If he is hearing voices he should see a psychairst to get a diagnosis and on anti-psychotic medication. If this is the case do a little study before he goes, I have been prescribed antipsychotics by a doctor before only to find out they were the worst for side effects such as tardive dyskinesia and diabeties. A little research goes a long way to try the least harmful meds first.
> I read it and must disagree with the bit about forcing the person into social situations.

That's why I mentioned it may be too big of a step, if it's social anxiety the person is experiencing they can take smaller steps(Working your way up), but like phobias you need to face the fear to overcome it.

Keep in mind I don't completely understand his brothers situation because I'm not him. He may actually want to go out and meet new people but has no way to do it.

There is nothing natural about a 'fear' of social situations, introvert or not.

I am not currently befriending new people and you may wonder why, I have much bigger problems which are stopping me that I don't wish to discuss on reddit, trying to deal with them at the same time. My situation is a very very complicated one, sometimes it feels as if I have no hope left but I won't give up.

>I am naturally introverted, and if someone was to take me out with friends I would feel insulted and insecure.

Are you sure that's introversion? I'm an introvert and I love going out for short amounts of time with friends, maybe one or two new people there.

Introversion doesn't equal anxiety.

I do agree with you making some close friends they always feel comfortable around, this has been the way I have lived all my life and wouldn't have it any other way.
I think the trouble is how I'm defining isolation, perhaps getting it mixed up with solitude or some such. The notion of going out and socializing has also gotten inextricably bound up with people who tell me to go out and party or visit themeparks and stuff, which are things I just don't enjoy doing. There's definitely a huge difference between isolation and introversion. I'm deep into both, the isolation is something I need to get rid of most likely, but I'll always be introverted. I don' see a reason not to be, anyway. I'll always be happy with long stretches of peace and quiet. 
But not everyone, or all the time. Saying it's never the answer IS dogmatic.
I like and agree with this post, you get an upvote.
I think you're being overly sensitive, probably because you're not used to talking to people and thust take overly extreme opinions. Good luck with that
That or you're just being a jerk. As far as I'm concerned this is all just more evidence as to why I should continue to avoid people. They just downvote you and make snide remarks.
Yeah he is being a bit of a jerk with adding "Good luck with that" but he is also right, you need to change the way you think.

>As far as I'm concerned this is all just more evidence as to why I should continue to avoid people. They just downvote you and make snide remarks.

This is the internet, negetive comments behind anonymity should cary no weight. Brush them off and forget about others being douches. The Reddit world is very different to the outside world, people outside the internet seem to generally have better manners and are nicer to other people. If they are not to you it's their problem not yours, brush it off and move on to other people who treat you with respect.

If there is anything that you can see you're doing wrong to be put in a position where you aren't welcome try and identify it and fix it but never let the thoughts get to you.

Don't get trapped in negetive emotions.
What gnaws at me is the idea that the internet shows people for what they really are. If they won't treat each other respect online, that means they're just faking it in real life. I could give up on the internet like I've tempted to again and again, and focus exclusively on real life relationships, but I wonder if that means I don't have any real reason to trust people.
To me this seems like a problem with your thought patterns, yes people can think things without saying anything IRL, but we all do, everyone judges other people even you, you need to learn not to care.

“All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by too much future, and
not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms
of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence.”

Eckhart Tolle, the power of now, well worth a read!
It's like there is two versions of reality, with two powerful groups of people insisting that only one is true. It takes so much cognitive effort to be objective. You can click on a comment section for an NPR story and see a mass of people speaking of something as an absolute truth, and click on a comment section for a Fox News story and suddenly you are in a parallel universe. The CIA reports something, and the president elect suddenly claims that the exact opposite is true. The US Committee on Science and Space and Technology is suddenly devoted to debunking the fundamental idea of climate change that is accepted by the rest of the scientific community. You can not say something wrong OR right because exactly half of civil society will passionately defend or reject any idea you have.    
    
I've been loosing sleep over this. It is all just so surreal and this idea of "post truth" just came out of nowhere. It's like a mass hysteria. Can we call this a public health crisis? 
What kinda bugs me, is that its very nearly 50/50 overall; but the distribution is extremely uneven; various regions are extremely one way, or extremely the other.

That's a very dangerous, fragile situation, that I believe people take too lightly just because things have been mostly ok for a while.
I think if you are losing sleep over this it is a whole other issue. The way I see it is an issue of credibility. For example, the CIA is infinitely more credible than the president-elect in my mind, so I know I should usually ignore Mr Trump. But I do agree that it is an issue. It seems like there is no way to get the unbiased truth nowadays...
Consequence of "first past the post" voting system.  US needs proportional representation, not winner takes all.
I think you are right to feel the way that you feel. I'm not sure if it can be deemed as a public health crisis, but after looking into certain issues recently, it seems clear that the government is actively trying to use propaganda to sway public opinion. And that's not just how I feel, they've literally [legalized using propaganda](https://www.occupycorporatism.com/how-the-ndaa-allows-us-gov-to-use-propaganda-against-americans/) as part of the NDAA. [more recent addition](http://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3765A225-B773-4F57-B21A-A265F4B5692C)

this is a really scary time. I myself am extremely liberal, but find myself disagreeing strongly against many liberal news outlets, as well as institutions or people that I previously considered to be credible. For example, someone said that the CIA is more credible than Donald Trump. While I might agree with this generally speaking, the FBI is now also countering the CIA's claims, so it's not like Donald Trump is the only one who believes what he's saying. If you read the articles about Russia impacting the US elections for example, they actually note that there was disagreement in whether or not they should present this info to the public, because the hackers were not part of the Russian government, but in fact, one step removed. But they reason that this is something Russia has done in the past, so therefore it must be them. No actual evidence of these hackers being Russian, or who they even are, just  that it's believed they're one step removed from Russia. And this is also counter to what Wikileaks has told us (Assange denied Russian involvement). So whom do you believe? 

It's difficult, there isn't really a clear answer at all. And in fact, all you have to do is look into US history to see that the government has indeed employed propaganda and seriously unethical practices as a means to an end. Many people didn't know about it at the time, and most believed the official narrative. Look into Operation Mockingbird or [MK Ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra). I'm not sure if there's a specific name for this bias, but it definitely exists -- to accept that our government has previously done immoral things to its people, but unwilling to accept that conspiracy or propaganda are currently being employed against citizens. 

I am glad you see the strangeness in it all. 
If anything we surely can call this a health crisis of our own. I too have lost sleep and friends over this exact issue, but it is my issue, is it not? I lose sleep, they don't. The commenters don't. Trump doesn't. 

After a long winded conversation with a close friend, I've realized everyone (in this case the cia, dnc, rnc, hillary, politicos etc.) has an agenda and is willing to spread lies to succeed. Take what you may at face value and choose to believe in something, because there is no way to know the actual truth, nor is there any established method to this madness. Get some sleep too. The indelible insanity of man isn't our problem.
We've always been "post truth" in the realm of politics; our society is a Jenga tower of truth, hope, lies and twisted perspectives. With respect to the manipulation of information by powerful groups, not much has truly changed. The big recent change I think its the ability of political advocates to use social media and coordinated media campaigns to bombard viewers or target groups with fearful, anxiety driven messages at a personal level. All this said, it is up to us, as it has always been, to try and sort out the truth from the fiction. Always keep in mind that fear is more often a tool used to manipulate than a reflection of reality; be above the fear!
That's what makes it worse, the contradictory narratives are never equal in credibility but the non-credible version of the story is being pushed by litterly the most powerful person in the world, and will be taken as truth by 50% of Americans. It's too much. 
But I don't quite understand why the CIA would want to destabilize our own government. If they were to fabricate information, you would think it would be something that could lead to impeachment and not just instability. Unless there is another play that the public is being set up for. 
I've seen clips of people who've been talked out of/failed suicide and said that eventually they were happy that they had survived but I always felt as though it was a front, is that true?
It's been five years, one week and two days since I attempted suicide. 


It DOES get better.
i would have never believed that a day would come when i would want to live.  one day i found better medication that changed my life and for the last 4 years i have been so thankful to have made it.  i truly am glad that my suicide attempt was a failure.  i am happy to be alive.  
Absolutely true.  And sustainably true.  It's been over 30 years since my last serious suicide attempt and at least 25 years since I've been at significant risk.  For the past 22 years I've been able to be directly involved in suicide prevention.   

Of course it would be naive to claim that everyone *will* recover, but I do think that almost everyone can.  There's been tremendous progress in understanding suicidality in the last decade or so, thanks to people like Thomas Joiner and Matthew Nock, among others.  The more we understand what drives people to suicide (e.g.  depression is now known *not* to cause suicidal behaviour and in some cases can actually prevent it), the better equipped we are to prevent people from being driven to the edge, and pull back the ones who are already there.  

Edit:  accidentally some words
I'm not saying I'm considering it by the way guys, I'm just intrigued. It's nice to see you all happy now though. This turned out surprisingly uplifting
Yes, eventually. I'm not going to discuss the actual attempt here, just the aftermath.

I attempted as a young teen. I refused to try again after that first time because of the devastation I saw in my mom's eyes, the one person who's constantly fought for me and loves me even when I don't love myself. I struggled during my whole teens with suicidal ideation and self harm, I fought hard to not attempt again and it was hard when my mind was just telling me that nothing would be better then something. I would consider my depression at that time a very active type of depression as I rapidly cycled between numb, sad and just pissed off at the world. 

Slowly as I grew into an adult this type of depression faded away as the hormonal/chemical storm in my brain lessened. For a few years after that, it was more of a passive depression, not wanting death but not really wanting to do anything either. I was constantly getting sick because I was stressed out over nothing and if I could have lived under my blanket I think I would have. I still had moments of happiness through all of this, even at the worst of it which almost made it worse when it would get ripped out from under you. Some medications I was on was leaving me feeling bored as well as depressed which is a dangerous mix, I couldn't even escape into games and books like I once did because I couldn't focus. 

I'm finally on a medication that is working and while my life isn't magically changed or anything, I am feeling better. I'm having a lot of good and happy days and the rougher days aren't so bad anymore. After years of inactivity I'm planning to go to school in the fall. I'm happy to be alive, I do wish I could have been living it a bit sooner but I'm learning to be okay with the time I've wasted. It's not like I can get it back anyway.
I have felt downright fucking euphoric over and over again in life since. It's been worth living. Don't get me wrong, depression's crept back in and I've wanted to do it again, but living was the right decision. I do a mood tracker. My mood's dipped into suicidal range this year (7/100, 0 being the worst it is possible to feel and 100 being pure euphoria) but for the most part my mood's been around 65-75/100 for the last year. I've had my shitty moments, but my life's become happy most of the time. It was worth living.
I failed at multiple (almost successful) attempts when I was 23.  It's been just over five years and everything has changed between then and now.

For the first couple of years I still didn't want to be alive.  Living a normal life span seemed an unbearable challenge.  I started to recognize patterns: I got more depressed every spring, I could recognize the "sound" of the particular voice in my head that was causing the worst of my moods.  I could pay attention to the warning signs and the triggers and mitigate the depression.

The biggest change was that during therapy I began to recognize the very harmful thought patterns that I had.  Black-and-white, all-or-nothing thinking, minimizing my positive traits, maximizing my negative traits, thinking that all the bad things that happened in my life happened because I was a terrible person.  I also got some new friends who accepted me as I was and I realized that I had never EVER been accepted like that before.  Everyone had wanted me to change and I had never felt capable of being what they wanted, which contributed to forming those bad thought patterns.

A very small thing that my new friend did changed everything for me: I went to a party with him and he introduced me by saying "This is CuirassCat, she is a little bit socially anxious."  Some other people at the party said that they were too.  My old friends had pressured me to hide it.  They would never bring it up as if it was OK.  Once I started to feel accepted that social anxiety was less intense and I could start being around people again.  Because of course after my suicide attempts all those old "friends" had dropped off the face of the planet.

I still get somewhat depressed every spring but I now have a great support network.  I got married six months ago and my husband totally gets me and what activities help.  I am often truly happy.
nope, havent felt happy yet. i dont believe it gets better
I survived an attempt two and a half years ago.

I still want to die every single day. I have my whole life. I wonder how long it's going to take until I have enough courage to try again.
Last year around this time I ran away from home to attempt to commit suicide, this was due to mental problems which led to scarred relationship with my family. I remeber crying a lot the night before when i was camping in the woods, knowing that i could not see my family ever again. 

After failing my suicide attempt trying to hang myself, I called my uncle and he helped me out of this situation. 

I now move back with my family, but life does not seem to be any better, although I will not attempt another suicide, I am currently at a state in which I do not care if I die and hope to die natually. But this has only been one year, things may change!
It's been about 9 years since my suicide attempt. I've since gotten married, traveled to 6 different countries, graduated college, set boundaries with toxic people, and made new friends who i can't believe I can care about this much. More importantly, I recieved an accurate diagnosis that meant treatment started working. It's not perfect, and I'm NOT always happy, but it makes me sick to think about all the deleriously happy and beautiful things in my life that wouldn't have happened if someone hadn't called 911. 
I take fluoxetine now and I feel great.
For me thats what its been, a front, but I guess its more of a CHANCE to get better, some people do and some dont but odds are if you give it a full lifetime somethings gonna make you want to live. 
No, I wasn't happier. I felt stuck in life, I felt like a failure and the one thing that could guarantee me escape; well I failed at that too. 
For me, my attempt was a wake-up call, almost like a sense of closure? I'd been suicidal for months, came very close multiple times but the time I actually attempted felt different. I was halfway through an overdose when it hit me that I didn't actually want to die. I told my boyfriend to call 999 and I spent the night in hospital.  The next day I had to wait five hours to see a mental health team which was very sobering. My phone was dead so I had nothing much to do and really had time to think. When I came to speak to them, I felt a bit humiliated. Why did I even attempt this? What made me do it? I realised that I didn't actually want to die, I just wanted to stop being so horribly depressed, a way out of the pain I was feeling. I had lovely friends, a loving boyfriend who would support me and family too, even if I don't always see eye to eye with them.
The next day I went to a party celebrating the end of my first year of university and I remember thinking, how did I ever want to give this up? I wanted to live, I wanted to get better. 
It's been don't think I would fully class myself as "recovered" as I am definitely still depressed, but on the whole I am a lot better than I was. I have never seriously contemplated suicide since and I have only relasped self harming once in five months, which I think is pretty huge since i used to do it every day. 

tl;dr although I wouldn't fully class myself as being fully happy again, I am definitely a lot better and well on the way to recovery :) 
HA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA no. 
Twice as a kid.  Glad I failed.
But I think about it ALL the dang time.  Very annoying.
I attempted 7 or 8 times and they were all very serious attempts. I am so glad I am alive today. I am so much happier than I ever thought I could be, and even though there was a lot of shit until I got better, it gets better. Hold on. I believe in you. You have a wonderful life out there, you don't want to miss it
[How interesting...even though we all supposedly don't care, I guess no one wants to be downvoted.]



&nbsp;

Personally, it got a *relatively* "better" for me but that only balances the pros and cons of my life. It in no way made it better to the point I'm enthusiastic about living <80 years old (as it seems for most here). 

For the people whose lives are better: bully for you but don't let your new lenses cloud the collective outlook which is neutral/highly situational. It got better ***for you***.

*That's it*.


&nbsp;


If people at risk "need" to hear that it gets better, I encourage them to be proactive, seek more aid, hear more testimonies, etc etc but I absolutely detest this superfluous optimism that seems to be in the narrative of suicide. 


&nbsp;



*edit



&nbsp;

There wasn't exactly a point to my message. I gave my opinion which is roughly the same with everyone else who commented so far with the exception that mine's isn't as rosy.

Choose for yourself. Don't rely on the testimonies that it did OR didn't get better.
Yeah it does after time 
Yes yes yes, 1000x over.

It wasn't the suicide attempt that did it, but the treatment I got afterwards. I didn't realize my life was worth something when the rope broke or some shit like that; I stayed depressed for a while. Didn't think I was going to get better since I've had issues my entire life and medication/therapy weren't enough.

Eventually I got ECT since there weren't many options left. Best decision I ever made. It still blows my mind how much it helped.

I wouldn't say I'm "happy" yet, but I'm way closer to being happy than I have ever been.
Eventually it does. When I attempted it was a rough time not just for me or my family but the entire freaking country. Literally the year after that, my life turned around. Granted, my mental health issues are still there by the added stress from the crisis is gone so I'm no longer in the same place I was back then. 
Yes. For the first few days or even weeks I was devastated I had failed, but with the help of treatment and the natural flow of my mood states, I did reach a time I was genuinely grateful that I hadn't succeeded. That outlook doesn't come overnight. The process to recovery or at least to some relief is a gradual one but a worthy one.
It's been just over a year since I tried and I'm lucky that I was already in the queue for help. In the past year, thanks to some amazing people at Mind, Time to Change and my local NHS mental health team I am back in work (not full time or the level I was before) and in a stable relationship. It has been really hard and I still lapse into depressed patches at the moment but...  I am better than I was before. 

I did an interview with a talk radio station last month about this : www.MattStreuli.uk 
I never made a full attempt; I can't "allow" myself to hurt the people I love.

It's now a full 10 years this month since I first went to drown myself...ideation goes from quiet to yelling, always in the back of my head. I've never made an attempt, because I know I'm not wholly committed to it, and I refuse to fail. So, I can whine to professionals about how bad it is inside, but because I can still keep appearances up for the most part it's not taken seriously. I'm at a point where I'm also not "allowed" to do most things; leave the house most days, go to class, text or talk to friends (I'll just pull away again, they don't need a flake like me), even in therapy I shut down and am "not allowed" to talk, I dissociate sometimes when it needs to be said by I can't get there, so it's not "me" saying it...sorry, what was the question? Haha...

Super unpopular opinion, please remove this if harmful to others, but I almost wish I had done something concrete towards an attempt, so at least I could try to move past it/get what I need/grow. But since I doubled down on self-preservation, my life is wasteful, wasted, and just really pathetic at this point. I don't know what to do about it.
Constantly relapsing constantly trying fee like I'm failing but I guess I kinda am making progress if I'm not actively trying to die eventho i feel hollow n VACANT inside
No i haven't. I tried to overdose and ended up passing out and then vomiting the pills straight back up.

I only feel happy because i have a reason to be happy. I need someone who matters to give me a reason to live because simply existing for the sake of it isn't living at all.

Nobody has given me a reason to live, therefore I've never been happy since that moment.
I've got quite a few suicide attempts, obviously all failed. I was never truly committed to doing it. 

It roller coastered for me, ups and downs for the better part of a decade. I got put on a new med and its helped tremendously. I haven't felt depressed or been cycling with bipolar for 6 months now.
What was the medication?
I'm starting to volunteer with a phone counseling organization which aims to prevent suicide.  Society's attitude is getting better but I still think its importance is under-appreciated.
Which meds do you have now?
Is the mood tracker an app? How does it work? Seems like something I could use
That reminded me of a friend I had like that too. Not long after we first met we were at an outdoor but crowded event, and I was trying to hide my anxiety from my group, but he noticed anyway and just said, hey, if you're a little anxious, want to walk to the edge of this crowd for some space for a minute? It was a little thing, but his kindness and acceptance in that moment really touched me. I thanked him and he just said he understood, treated me normally, and that was that.

Unfortunately a couple of years later he suddenly died and I still don't know what exactly happened. He was only 31. I miss him.
Just curious, how were they all serious attempts? Did you try something different every time? Or did you do the same thing and legitimately think it would work next time?
"It got better for you"...   hmm; actually no. (or at least not for a very long time)  I gave up after the 2nd attempt because I realized I couldn't succeed.   Survival instinct was simply overpowering.  I produced a decent wound on my wrist, blood was flowing good, and then I went cold as ice inside absolutely emotionless, then executed perfect first aid, and walked home.   Apparently, not even my own body cared what I wanted.

I got no treatment afterwards, as I cooked up a pretty spiffy story that parents were all to happy to believe.   I'm not sure the ER doc believed me, but I can't remember that part.     No, at that point, I surrendered and began just living the script provided by those around me.     Script didn't break till early this year, did some self-help, found some outside help, and I may yet have a few years of life left as a sane, me, to experience.
What's ECT?
Remeron is the brand name.  Mirtazapine is the generic.

Good on you!   
Zoloft, I've tried several others in the past though some of which were fairly similar to it so part of me wonders that as I've gotten older my brain chemistry has changed to a place where it's more receptive to medication.
There ARE a bunch of apps but I made mine myself in google sheets (excel). I use it in part because I can track whatever the hell I've felt like, which has included taking my amphetamine other than as prescribed, exactly how much sleep I've been getting, and how much brain fog I've got going on. I've used Bipol-app on my ipod touch, I've used patientslikeme.com's mood tracker... but honestly I'd ask around or check threads like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/4jcdf2/mood_trackers/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/5562qv/mood_tracker_recommendations_for_me_and_my/) on bipolarreddit or elsewhere. And the euphoria? It's mostly occurred outside of mania. My psychiatrist doesn't even think I've been manic this year at all.
The first time I tried to kill myself i was 12 and took a bunch of pills but I didn't take enough so I didn't know how much to take. The next time I was also 12 and swallowed batteries and pieces of a mirror which was like stupid and just caused a lot of discomfort. The next time I tried it with alcohol in addition to the pills and got very sick and was taken to the hospital to have my stomach pumped.  I also slit my wrists around that point but I slit where you take your pulse not down the middle. I lost a lot of blood and have nerve damage but I was fine. Then finally I took a large enough overdose and was in the ICU for a week because my little brother found me. I was 15 or younger when I did all of this and not very smart. Then I was in a lock down treatment center for most of them and so I got immediate medical attention and was watched well enough that I got treatment in time. I stole a box cutter and slit both arms from wrist to elbow so you could see the tendons. They took me immediately to the hospital and once I was off suicide watch I reopened the wounds and cut inside of them again. 

Not dishonest, just very young and in an incredibly abusive situation I had no way out of. 
Electro Convulsive Therapy.   Used to be called Shock Therapy.   It's done with sedation now.  Not like the movies
Thank you. I already heard good things about Zoloft/sertraline. So far, I had 5 different antidepressants and none of them seemed to work. I think I'm gonna ask for sertraline...

I wish you all the best and I hope that there will be lots and lots of happy days for you!
Wow thats so crazy and so sad. I'm glad your better now. I didn't think you lied, like I said, just curious how that worked. Sounds totally believable for a kid who didn't get adequate help :(
Thank you, I hope you find the right medicine for you :)
Thank you so much! I am a lot better now after about 7 years of therapy. Still have some trauma to get through but I've come light years from where I was. When I got taken out of my abusive home by CPS the suicide attempts slowly stopped. Thank you for your support. 


Does it really affect women more, or do more women seek treatment and thus can be included in the statistic?
That seems really low. Maybe it's just where I live. I wonder what the rate is in Seattle.. Probably closer to 8 in every 10.
I'm a male suffering from anxiety and I would be included in the 92%, so could be yes

Same thing as "oh cheer up" to a depressed person
So what? You're just in an heightened state of anxiety 24/7 and it's literally impossible to relax? Come on.
Not exactly. There are a number of things people could do when having anxiety like taking deep breaths but there's nothing of the type for depression.
I'm saying that these are phrases that simplify the problem, as if it was something that doesn't have deep implications in the life of those affected
Makes sense.

After a long struggle to figure it out, I found out that uncertainty is what usually gives me panic attacks more than anything else. This hits home.
I've gone back to school as a full time student in my mid 50s. I'm not really sure I'm going to be able to pass and complete the course and go on to the job it is training me for. This uncertainty has made me suicidal at times. At least with death there is nothing left to worry about.


I just don't understand how you can ban that.
I found this out the other day when I needed to leave school early for a therapy appointment. It was the only possible time I would have been able to go that week, so I needed to leave half an hour early. I didn't bring it up to the administration, but I wanted to. One's mental health is just as important as one's physical health, at least in my opinion. I understand how one can view physical health as being more important, but I also understand that if one's mental health is compromised, that facilitates the degradation of one's physical health. I don't have many people to talk about this to, so I figured I should turn to this subreddit.
If what you write is accurate, these actions on the part of your school are not allowed under the ADA. They may even be violating state law.

Have your parents get in contact with the local legal advocacy group in your state. 

See this page for contact info (choose your state on the right side of the page): http://www.ndrn.org/en/ndrn-member-agencies.html

You mustn't let them get away with this because if they are doing this to you, they are doing it (or will be) to others. 

I should emphasize that most likely this will not lead to a trial, etc. Often a simple letter from a lawyer verbally bitch-slapping them is enough.

PS: Stories like this truly piss me off. It's a good thing I don't know what school you go to, because I'd be on the phone with your principal in a heartbeat reading them the riot act.

Have your therapist write a note and see if it makes a difference.  Or challenge the school and start at your school counselor and work your way up.
/u/luxdesigns knows where it's at. You can challenge this. In my opinion, there is no distinction between mental and physical health. Having a virus and having serious mental health issues can be equally dangerous and crippling in my estimation, and they both affect you in a very physical way - whether it's the fatigue and flu-like symptoms, or it's actually life threatening, your mental health *is* your physical health.
That is bizarre? I see a Psychiatrist so he is technically an MD (Doctor), but seeing a Therapist for Mental health should just as important as getting that weird freckle checked out right?

Either way it is none of the school's business. 
All they need to know is you have a medical appointment, nothing more. 
That's straight up bullshit. I would absolutely challenge the school on it. I would also contact the [American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/) and see if you can either get them to back you or at least send your school a letter explaining just how bullshit their response is. If you have a diagnosed mental condition, and your treatment for that condition is therapy, then that is no different than a student with a medical or physical illness that requires a doctor's appointment or special accommodations while at school. 

Please keep us posted on how this goes!
That is awful.  You and your parents need to take this one to the superintendent's office and/or the school board!
It's terrible that in the 21st century that people and institutions (especially educational institutions) still take the viewpoint that implies that mental health issues aren't as serious as physical ones.

If you're in Canada, this would be a violation of the Human Rights Charter.
Here is the link to the site which where you can find the guidelines and how to file a complaint:

http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/eng
That's because that institution believes it should be the only one influencing your mind.
>and they both affect you in a very physical way - whether it's the fatigue and flu-like symptoms, or it's actually life threatening, your mental health is your physical health.

This is so true! I have PTSD and anorexia, both of which come with depression. The depression causes all manor of physical symptoms, the PTSD makes it nearly impossible to function some days, and the anorexia damn near killed me before I entered treatment, so you are absolutely right that mental illness is just as serious as physical illness!
According to the school's website, "All early dismissals for doctor or dental appointment must be verified by the doctor or dental office (i.e., doctor’s stamp on the early dismissal form or note from the doctor’s office). The student must check back in to school upon returning from the absence and return the signed/stamped white verification slip to the attendance office."

I had assumed that they would give me the verification slip because I had assumed that they would regard a therapy appointment in the same way as a doctor's appointment. However, they did not give me anything. On my early dismissal slip, the "personal" criteria was selected under the "unexcused" reasons/absences list. "Therapy" was written as a note at the bottom, but that was it, and so I wasn't even given the option of "clearing" anything.

I'm going to ask my therapist for a note and see if that "clears" my absence, but if it doesn't, I'll be challenging the school as /u/rancid_squirls and /u/luxdesigns suggested.
I definitely will! I've asked my therapist for a note to clear my absence, and if they don't accept it, that's when I'll take a more aggressive approach to addressing the issue.
I am in Southern California, but thank you. I am in complete agreement with you.

Edit: Why am I being downvoted on this?
Ugh, sorry you're going through this... if you can, keep this updated. Would be helpful.
If you are in California the school is even more screwed. The state has very clear laws giving you protections beyond Federal law.
Good for you! Don't go down without a fight! This is straight up discrimination and ignorance. While I am angry for you (and I've been treated the same way based on my mental illnesses as well), I see this as an opportunity to educate your school's administration about the magnitude of mental illnesses, so that this can be prevented in the future, and maybe your school can take a more understanding and empathetic approach to the needs of their students.
I understand. When I saw that they had marked "personal" as the reason for my absence, when they had relegated attending therapy to the same level as not attending school for a vacation, I was immediately disdainful and entirely aware of my generally suppressed irritation with the educational institution. Things need to change.

The colors and chaotic feeling would only make me worse.  Our local psych hospital has a unit called the special care unit, it was originally meant for elderly or medically fragile patients but now gets people like me with bad anxiety and PTSD as well.  They have a great set up for the patients - 
-Nurses and techs tend to work on that unit only, more calm and interact/talk with patients.
-Hospital type beds, instead of the usual mental hospital crappy beds.  It does have two 'padded rooms' with the usual low beds though. (I prefer the padded rooms, room to myself and quiet.  Note..it's a real bedroom just padded.  Has a window, access to its own half bath in a tiny hall right off it, etc)
-Each room has a private bath, two people share it.  Whole unit has an extra shower in a room off the main hall AND a room with a tub.  As long as a staff member leaves door cracked and sits outside, you can take a bath!
-Two day rooms for the MAX of 10 ppl on the unit, each with its own flat screen TV.  One room has a DVD player for movies.  Both TVs have over 100 channels. Unlimited access to juices and cereal in one room.
-Good, healthy food in hospital cafeteria.  Always have fruit and a salad bar.
-6+ Outside AKA smoke breaks a day in day, including two of them being half hour ones.  Covered shelters to smoke in when it's raining, Nice sitting area for when weather is nice.

The units still have the hospital look to them, but they keep things clean.  Nice gym for playing games and an art classroom type room for art therapy.  They also have a music therapist who goes from unit to unit.  For being in a psych hospital, its. Not too damn bad.
Too impractical. The hanging cables alone are a big WTF.

Too much color could set some people off.

etc., etc. A nice idea with good intentions, but I'd hate to see what happens when some of that stuff gets thrown around by someone.
And so many things that could be used for self harm.
The one thing that I really wanted during my time in psych wards was a place that I could exercise, I understand the limitations of hospitals but still you could allow some people to exercise in a gym environment if they were deemed not to be a harm to themselves while there and under supervision. 
looks like a psych ward as designed by a manic pixie dream girl

That makes my OCD go into overdrive....

It's like "are you on your period" except worse
YES! This is something that has always deeply offended me, especially as an obviously hyperactive child. 
Ooo, I fucking hate that one. To me, it's almost as bad as saying "Are you off your meds?" because not only is it taking a jab at mental symptoms, but it's also inadvertently insulting your gender, as if it's something within our control. Nothing pisses me off more than hearing a man say that to a woman, and I am definitely guilty of going completely off in the presence of a man that does. 
I've never asked a girl that. Actually sounds like a good idea. Could be a very relevant question. Just like "Are you off your meds". Also funny. It's at the other person's expense, of course, but that's the point isn't it? Sometimes we all share a laugh, and sometimes we all just laugh at you, because fuck you. 
Intentionally offending someone over something that they can't help and that they're likely to be sensitive about is funny? 

Tell me *why* you're even in this subreddit in the first place.
calm down, dude.
It's nothing to do with people who are actually suffering. These are jokes that normal people tell to one another. Most of us understand that it isn't important or a big deal and we don't take it seriously. We're conveying our frustrations and getting a little chuckle at the same time. 

If someone we know is actually suffering from say, that time of the month, or the absence of their prescription, of course we wouldn't joke about that. That would be just being a dick. Everyone understands that. At the same time I know what it's like to go without meds. I take 40mgs of Prozac every morning, and if I find if I skip it for long enough I really start becoming another person, a rather less capable and rational person at that. 

I've also known a lot of women on their periods who are best steered clear of. In both cases I can say that "Are you off your meds" or "Are you on your period" are fantastic analogies to make for someone is behaving strangely or badly. You can't make me stop using these phrases. They're too perfect. This social justice crusade to make us offended by every little thing has nothing to do with mental health. 
No


Thank you 

tw abuse
""We tried everything. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Hitting her back (I won't tell you how many people told us that all she needed was a good beating). We took all her toys away. We gave her toys away. We tried starving her. We did EVERYTHING we could to try and break her. Nothing worked."
"The violence became so bad that at times Susan and I both lost it and hit Jani as hard as we could. We hit in impotent rage.
We got a referral to a psychiatrist.
Two months later, Janni was hospitalized for the first of what has since been four times, but in truth will be many more times.
Today, Jani is no longer a brat. Today, Jani is schizophrenic."

He's since deleted the original page, I believe, but I'm disgusted by the abuse (supposedly justified by her being "difficult") and the way he's exploiting his daughter and writing about her personal struggle with mental illness in public, under her real name.

I feel for Janni, and I hope things get better for her.
I've been following Janni (jani) and her story for about a year now. I feel for her and her family. Not everyone responds to medications, but it also took my psychosis a year to come under control with a high, steady dose of the right med. With that said, some people are institutionalized with untreatable schizophrenia. It's a shame too. It's terribly miserable being psychotic, constantly hearing voices. I only hope that as she comes of age some of these medications work for her.
This article made me late to work
it's a good article.  but it's a shame he believes this is some uncurable thing.  medication does more than enough to slow down the psychosis.  after that point, CBT works wonderfully well even if it's family-directed.  it takes more effort than people are used to putting in to personal growth, it takes reflecting upon and retraining, but they're skills that can be learned and practised.  

it's a shame professionals haven't given him the good reasons to hope for how she turns out.
From another comment on that page: "How many times in the guys blog does he use the word[s] 'stimulate" & stimulation'?? He was investigated for sex-abuse, he claims that his hand "slipped" into her vagina when he was vigorously washing her privates at age 6." What.
From his blog: "if she is not Schizophrenic, then she is just a brat". He has also admitted to hitting his wife. 
Nice label. I can't imagine what they went through. I can't imagine how I would react. I know in my heart I will never hit a kid. I know in my heart I will never abandon her. but when faced with this? How many would've walked away? Put her in a place to rot, sink further in her psychosis. They didn't. They were there for her.

They are good parents who love their child very much. They are not perfect and hitting a child is wrong. They could've done a hell of a lot worse. I'm not even sure I would've done it better.
I don't trust the word of an admitted abuser, especially not one who's broadcasting the personal struggles of his very young daughter under his real name.  No parent is perfect.  *We tried starving her. We did EVERYTHING we could to try and break her. Nothing worked." "The violence became so bad that at times Susan and I both lost it and hit Jani as hard as we could.* is not a failure to be perfect, it's abuse.

And trauma from that can make mental health problems seriously much much worse.

A very close friend who has been struggling with depression for the last few years is celebrating his birthday soon and I really want to get him something that he'd be fond or and would cheer him up a little bit. I don't get the chance to see him super often (he's in grad school in a different city) but I happen to be in his area for a few weeks so I'll be taking him out to dinner on the day after his birthday!  He's an outrageously sweet, smart, and awesome guy - and I want him to feel appreciated and supported - especially since he moved to his new city not too long ago.

So far, I've written up a funny card full of inside jokes and stories about how awesome he is, ordered a little cake with his favorite flavors, and gotten a handmade blank leather journal with his name monogrammed on it.  Do you think that might be something he'd appreciate?  Or should I try to find something a bit more interactive/uplifting?
If it were me, I would be touched to have such wonderful gifts from such a caring friend. :-)
I'm totally stealing your gift idea. As someone that struggles with depression, I would be thrilled to get any of those amazing and clearly well thought out gifts. You're a good friend.
I might just cry tears of joy and hug her if she did even a tenth of that for me.
Yes! That sounds great! But don't say that you're doing these things for him in hopes that he will cheer up. Just say it's because of all those good qualities you mentioned in your post
You're a good, thoughtful friend. I'm sure he'd love it
That sounds awesome!!! You are so sweet!! 
Honestly, I'm a bit jealous of him. The gifts sound great, but what really impacts me is the work and planning you have done. 

I know one of the things I struggle with from the depression is the idea that I am not worth anyone's time. The amount of thought and effort you have put into your gifts/plans for him show that you see him as worth it, and also give him something to look to, both in the physical gifts as well as the memories, as a reminder of how much you care when he needs to remember that someone does care.
I've got a lil' bit experience in case of depression... and in my opinion- cheering a person with depression is senseless. The best gift you can give to him is just your presence and understanding. I was always in a shittier mood when someone tried to 'make me feel happy' because there was no possibility for me to feel any kind of possitive emotion and that was actually the reason which made me even more depressed next day because of the guilt I felt (hey... they're doing something for you and you cannot even appreciate it).
Maybe you're friend isn't struggling with a sense of guilt but I'd consider it as highly possible option.

Please keep in mind, it's just my opinion based on my personal experiences. 
I'm aware that each person is different :)

This sounds awesome. You will definitely make him feel appreciated and supported, and definitely thought of.
These are great ideas honestly! I also think putting your main focus in on the experience/event is going to touch him the most. The gifts are great for once you're gone, but honestly, the true joy will lie in spending a wonderful evening with a great friend like you! 
As someone with clinical depression (someone once told me even I have it worse of anyone he's ever seen...including his own girlfriend who is also depressed)...I personally would like it. Absolute bare minimum I would appreciate the effort.
The fact that you're going out of your way to celebrate with him will mean a lot! I'm sure he will like the gifts. Remember his enthusiasm levels may be down, or he may feel unworthy of gifts. He may also get tired quickly.

To be honest though, the fact that you care and want to spend time around your friend even if he's not at his best will mean so much. Often when people get depressed, everyone around them sorta bails or acts like they're a martyr for "dealing with" you when you're depressed. One of the best things I've ever had someone say to me was when I was thanking my boyfriend for putting up with me (I had messed up a blue apron meal, gotten pissed off, and then laid in the floor and cried over what a failure I was) he said, "Honestly, it's not that big of a deal. I don't understand why some people make a thing out of it. Sometimes you just need a little extra time or help. Other times you don't. Same as anyone, really." 

Statements like that and people who stick by you are rare for the mentally ill. I'm sure your friend will love the gift and appreciate your time and effort more than your know.
Oh my god... You are AMAZING
Thanks so much for all the support and advice!  I think I'll go with what I've got and I'll know not to expect to cheer him up or anything.  I know that he hasn't been doing too great lately and I just can't wait to see him and spend time with him - even if it's just dinner and going on a walk afterwards to catch up.  I've blocked off the afternoon and evening to do whatever he wants.  He means so much to me and there's nothing more that I want in this world than to show him that.  He (and all of you) deserves the world and absolutely deserves to be happy.  I'll let you all know how it goes.  :) 
With my latest and most ferocious episode of depression, I learnt a very important life lesson that I hope I will never forget, because I'm probably going to need it again some day.

Having major depressive disorder, I typically deal with with 6 to 12 month stints of unrelenting and crippling depression. During these episodes it goes everywhere with me. It follows me through the door at work; it stands in front of my television at night; it even likes to jump in the bed midway through sex, making an enjoyable activity an ordeal in itself. It's safe to say that I have been knocking on deaths door more times than I would like to think, especially at the age of 22.

In the past five years, I've been through two of these depraved and sadistic episodes and now have an 80% chance of having another. But thinking about it now, I'm okay with that. Do you know why...? It's because each time I've gone through this it has taught me something valuable about myself, the world and even the illness. Today I'm in a position to share what I learnt with you, because I want to help you and even if you don't believe it right now, I have felt the agonising torture you are going through. And again, even if you don't believe right now, (I can't stress this enough) you will get better!

So, let me rewind a little. In December 2016, my world came crashing down around me... again. Familiar feelings didn't begin to creep back into my life, they hit me like a f***ing bulldozer. I lost my job and I think I was close to losing my relationship at some point. I sat, staring out my bedroom window, watching the grey monotony of the afternoon join forces with the overcast sky. Sunny days were even worse. I felt nothing. Even crying didn't alleviate the pain anymore. In fact, I couldn't cry at times. At other times I cried for five days in a row, in despair of what had happened to me and what I had become.

To make matters worse, I was derealised. This is the aspect of my depression and anxiety that I found the most terrifying. Everything seemed like some strange, warped CGI incarnation of what I used to know. I would compare it to not being sure whether the flowers on a restaurant table are wax or are real, only with everything. Sometimes colours seemed off; either they were overwhelmingly bright, or they were pallid and faded. I also felt like I was sat far back in my head, watching all this going on.  

When I knew what was happening, I also approached these Alien feelings all wrong and this was the beginning of a journey that taught me what I know today... Depression 101! 

I decided that I would  look at my depression in a scientific way, looking at it for what it was; a chemical imbalance in my brain that resulted in atrophy of different brain systems. I tried distanced myself from my depression as much as I could and say "hey, scientifically it's impossible for me to stay this way," which was partly true. But this played down the pain I was feeling by not making it about myself. I wasn't caring about my feelings. In fact, it put a more existential spin on my feelings, because it meant all the feelings that I had ever felt were the result of a chemical balance. It meant I wasn't I person.

I treated it this way until one morning. I woke up and couldn't take it anymore. To put it bluntly, I didn't think I was going to make it through the next ten minutes, let alone the next day. My CBT wasn't due to come through for another 12 weeks and I had no-one to turn to, so in a desperate attempt to save my own life, I frantically searched the internet for someone to talk to. 

Luckily, I found a depression support group 10 miles away. I threw on some clothes and went to the train station. When at the station, I stood in a corridor away from the platform so I didn't throw myself under the train.

The group absolutely opened up my eyes. I was anxious, derealised and despairingly depressed when i first walked in, but when I walked out, I felt my first glimmer of hope. Here were these people who felt what I felt! It wasn't just me! And you know what... each and everyone of them had a personality. Each and everyone of them was an amazing human being, with incredible, lovable and inspiring traits. I thought, "They were human, does that make me human?" It certainly seemed so.

From this meeting and many more that followed, I slowly learnt that what I was feeling really did hurt and it was okay to feel that way, because other people felt that way. I realised how much pain I was in and I even wanted to feel it, because for the first time in five months I could feel at least something. It's only when I could feel this pain that I could address it. When it was attacking me on a personal level, I knew i didn't deserve it because I cared about the human I was.

2 months after going to that meeting, I am sat here now, with a new job and madly in love with my girlfriend again. I still occasionally have little feelings creep up on me, but I'm okay with them, so they don't feel as big and scary and don't develop into anything more sinister. My derealisation isn't there more days than it is and when it is, I don't really care because I'm doing alright. I can even feel happiness and relief (something I never thought I would feel again).

I read a book today that inspired me to write this and I wanted to add in the quite that I identified with on a very personal level. It goes, "They think to scare me. Well, they have. I am scared, but more than that, I am a person, I am a human, I am a walking humerous human being... ...I am learning the pathways of the heart." Shirley Jackson 1959.
This is so pure and beautiful, thank you for sharing it. 
And I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better. It sound like you are an incredibly strong human being and you have given me so much hope. Thank you.
Thank you for this.
thank you for sharing. 
Thank you for sharing this! I hope you continue to learn and heal. 
thank you so so much for this, much love to you 


Open up to.........SATAN!!!
The real question is what edition are they playing? r/dnd
So legit. 

I used to run groups in a public play setting, and though it was taxing dealing constantly with the people that weren't invited into other groups, it was very rewarding until one guy ruined it. It seemed to help them a lot. 

(3.5 and 4e before anyone asks) 
I generally don't think a kid should have a therapist unless they want one. If there entree into it is a game they could get the wrong message about the meaning of therapy. Even after being diagnosed I wouldn't participate in therapy for far too long.
My thoughts too. I was raised in a conservative religious environment and taught that playing D&D was a gateway to hell. 
As an adult who still has the same problems I had since child hood I wished I was pushed into therapy even when I didn't want to go.
I never had problems until I caught a severe disorder at 18
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well I wasn't exactly a healthy teen. I had an increasing problem with drugs and alcohol (and delinquency)from 12-18 that I failed to recognize. I even got a scholarship to a "selective" college but went crazy and left.
 The quiet optimist in me sometime believes that having a schizophrenic episode saved me from a criminal life, and hard drugs. I still had/have a drug problem but never touch hard stuff. I barely smoke pot or drink anymore.

I find it a little disturbing that this article encourages parents to monitor their adolescents' online usage because that's often the only place they feel safe to express their mental health issues, yet doesn't say anything about providing an alternate safe space. 

Let's take away these kids' remaining safe space! That will solve their problems!

Grossly tone - deaf imo. 
I believe it. It's depressing times we live in.
No way, it's almost like teenagers growing up in a period of heavy social reformation, having those who participate in the reformation slandered and insulted, combined with an extremely volatile political climate, with a dash of extremely expensive colleges, expensive healthcare, and a dwindling job market actually has an effect on those about to enter.  I'm shocked.
You mean by putting children under extreme amounts of societal pressure plus stressing them with standardized tests all the time isn't HEALTHY for them? SHOCKING. -_- 
The news is that the nation takes teen anxiety and depression seriously.
I agree. In this country I feel too many parents give excuses for being shitty parents. Don't go creeping on your kid's social media, be a gotdamn parent and talk to your kids.
Anyone else? 
I have depression and an eating disorder. It makes the weight gain unbearable. 
Ask to go on different anti depressants? 

Ive been taking them for years and my appetite is the same as ever

Edit- I suppose there are many diff types of medication but ask your doctor. They should factor in that concern
Oh my God, yes. All the yeses. :(
Me too. I once went off my pills  (effexor) because I feared losing my mobility as I age, but had to go back on them when my life fell painfully to pieces. 
It doesn't necessarily cause weight gain, it just makes it do you can put on weight more easily. With the medication I took, I actually found the motivation to stick to my diet and exercise more. It's probably just me though.
Antidepressant that increase the level of serotonin in your brain produce those results.

Ask your doctor to prescribe an antidepressant that act on dopamine. Not only you will not gain weight, you might lose some, and they are also good with sexuality which usually is part of happiness as well.
Not sure if you can ask for Pristiq? but that's what I'm on, weight gain isn't a side effect. I was prescribed b/c I have a history with eating disorders & this one has the lowest side effect. 
Downside? You have to take it on time daily, or else you start going through withdrawl
Absolutely. What are you on? 
If you're in England your GP should be able to refer you to a dietitian or a weight loss group. 
Same here. The scale seriously won't budge.
talk to the doc about another med or increase your efforts toward dieting/exercising
I've struggled with bulimia for over 10 years and the weight gain caused by my meds honestly is enough to offset whatever benefits I gain. It's all very bleak.
Sometimes weight gain has nothing to do with appetite. Not op, but I'm prescribed adderall for adhd, and while it decreases my appetite, I've gained weight steadily since I started taking it last year, 20 lbs in fact. 

But I was underweight a little when I first started taking it, do over just fleshed out a little lol. Doctor is still baffled by it. 


First the back story: my aunt has had severe depression with anxiety, lethargy, paranoia, and even psychosis for almost a year. She has been basically unable to function, and has had to have near 24/7 supervision by family members.  We were starting to lose hope because she had tried nearly everything available, including in-patient stays at well-regarded psychiatric hospitals. She was continually insistent that nothing was working, and meanwhile was sabotaging relationships and acting really destructively. It was very hard to watch, and I think the whole family has been a little traumatized over this, especially because it seemed to come out of nowhere.

So, just recently a new doctor was able to do some tests, and diagnosed her with the [MTHFR mutation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-integrationist/201409/genetic-mutation-can-affect-mental-physical-health). Basically, her body cannot properly process folate (a B vitamin) into the necessary neurotransmitters of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. The doctor has put her on a mega-dose of L-Tryptophan (a precursor to serotonin) as well as a few other pharmaceuticals (sorry I don't have more details) and she has made massive, sudden improvements in the last few weeks.

This is really interesting for our family, because my father also had severe manic/depression (Bipolar 1) which was completely uncontrolled until his late 20s, when he started L-Tryptophan and improved within a week. So, he probably has the same genetic mutation as my aunt, though he hasn't been tested. I used L-Tryptophan for a while as an adolescent, and it was pretty effective, but I haven't felt that I needed it in a while.

Apparently another form of treatment for this problem is to take L-methofolate, which is the pre-processed form of folate that people with the MTHFR need. 

If you or a loved one is suffering from severe mental illness that hasn't responded to medication, PLEASE ask your doctor (or inquire with local labs yourself) about getting an MTHFR test. It's relatively inexpensive and the results could seriously change your life. There's also /r/MTHFR which apparently isn't super active, but might have more information.

**TL;DR**: Otherwise undiagnosable and untreatable mental illnesses could be caused by a genetic mutation which makes it hard to process folate.

This is legit advice, is provided by leading suicide prevention sites, as well as other places.

The important point is they may not be happier, but they will be calmer because they have made a decision. They will also often stop seeking help or continuing therapy at this point if they have been. Generally people react to this as positive news and they get a lot of support and encouragement, which can fuel it.

Behind the scenes they are likely making arrangements.

Why the fuck is this serious message on a duck meme?
But it's true, feels like the heavy burden you are carrying isn't there anymore. I think that's what it feels to be truly relaxed. 
Source?
isn't that a symptom of Bipolar Disorder?
It probably has something to do with the username of OP. Not really supporting the whole adviceanimals thing they got going on, just pointing it out.
If you were approached on the street by someone with a serious message, would you be more likely to listen if a human said it or a duck?
I found this image while browsing the internet. The meme is known as 'advice mallard' it intended for serious advice in meme format. And at this moment my username is unfortunate (has nothing to do with the meme).
I think it was 9gag.com 
I'd like to know as well! 
Depends on how you define "mania". According to [this website](http://www.helpguide.org/articles/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-signs-and-symptoms.htm) it can include:
>feelings of heightened energy, creativity, and euphoria are common...
Mental illness isn't as cut and dry as people would like it to be. There are different levels of Bipolar and going from being really depressed to really happy to really depressed and over and over again is a possible symptom of bipolar disorder. If you're not sure a person is bipolar it might mean they are planning suicide. Probably the best thing to do is show concern for their well being with such a dramatic change in emotional state.
If you are referring to mania, then that is way beyond simply being "happy" or relaxed. It is a very frantic and disorganized state of hyperactivity. 
I only take serious advice from ducks.
So... Absolutely no source at all. And it's currently at the top of /r/mentalhealth . Awesome.
reddit, lol. this sub is that big anyway
I have heard this before multiple times though, I'm sure that we could find a source for the information somewhere legit if we looked?
It's true, tho. 

I'll take a look at your blog, but my first thought, when I saw the little yellow and pink logo, in the bottom left corner, was, "*What's the deal with the rubber chicken?*"

-
**edit:** After reading your first post, here's some constructive criticism:

* First animation is not good. The text is too fast, and the text placement is not smooth for reading. The "to you" should not be on top of the previous words, as the human reading pattern, in English, is from the top left to the bottom right.
* "Support Us!" on the right side bar - "Us" should not be capitalized.
* Consistency is key.

"That one of every four people will experience mental illness in their lives?

That 10% of children have a mental illness?"

Should be:

That one out of every four people will experience mental illness in their lives?

That one out of every ten children have a mental illness?

-OR-

That 25% of people will experience mental illness in their lives?

That 10% of children have a mental illness?

* You have some punctuation errors (such as: "*They might, because mental illness and the issues associated with it are often ignored in our society.*" should be "*They might, because mental illness, and the issues associated with it, are often ignored in our society.*" There are many other missing commas.
* The bottom image has poor font selection, as there is not enough space between the words "let's put our" (it looks like one word), and the two flashing (***please*** don't do that**!**) bubbles need an "and" or ampersand between them.
I don't want to be horrible, but I'm just going to give a little constructive criticism too. I hate to be really picking, but this is what's stood out to me, some people may notice it subconsciously or not.

Your wording in that picture at the bottom left "visit our blog" just didn't seem right to me, if you put "Visit our website at..." or even just "Visit us". 

The type face, to me, just didn't scream serious, it's a very soft and fluid type face being all bubbly, mental illness is serious, you want to get this message to people, a harder more rigid typeface to me would do that, that it's not beating around the bush. Really, to me it would be to leave the top 2 lines in that typeface, then the "...will never receive treatment?" In a harsher typography to get the seriousness across. 

The little rubber chicken in the corner confused me a bit, have a look at some of the other mental health awareness projects like mind, rethink, time to talk, all those sites and their logo's.

And finally, I'd just recommending spending the £15-£20 on getting a web address that doesn't end in the .wordpress. 

Other than that, it's fantastic that you're doing this, you could completely disregard all that I've said, I'm probably being a miserable shit because I've just spent 5 days analysing a product to the death to be doing another 5 days next week and the ways we're being targeted and the different focuses and controls of the clientele and the way they engage.

Don't be disheartened by me just being a dick, you're doing a great job I'd just REALLY love for this to succeed! 
Thank you so much for the criticism! 
Thank you so much for the feedback!

Hmm, in hindsight you're probably right about the typeface, I think it does come off as too bubbly.

And yeah, I think the colouring does make it look a bit strange.  We've been worried about that a bit after the other guy pointed it out.

But again thank you so much for your feedback!
I just want you to look your best. =)

edit: Just in case, my post was constructive criticism, not criticism. They are different.
Once again, thanks. We're very new to this and can use all the help we can get. 
I'm happy to help. It's kind of what I do (I'm a part time proofreader).

I dunno if that describes my psychosis well. For me it's more like my mind stays the same, healthy and normal, but everything else becomes weird and strange. Seeing patterns that I didn't before etc. obviously once I'm better I see the truth but I never really feel different when psychotic. It's why it's hard to tell when you're having an episode. Once I start looking for hidden cameras in my apartment that's usually when I remember I'm being silly 
 
> I never really feel different when psychotic

I think this is a really important thing that I hardly ever hear (see?) anyone say. I always thought psychosis was a) always something really bizarre and b) always traumatic and fear-inducing. It took me yeeeeaaarrrrsss to realize that my 'overactive imagination' was really auditory hallucinations, and 'being massively wrong about things' was really delusions. I think all most people ever see is the over-dramatized version in movies/tv shows, or at least, that was *my* only frame of reference. I wasn't breaking everything in sight or paralyzed with fear, so the words 'psychotic symptoms' never even entered my mind (until other stuff started happening that *did* get my attention). 


It describes mine pretty well. I did have symptoms like yours a few years ago but since i've been on olanzapine it seems to have calmed down. 
Good luck, buddy.
Yeah Hollywood has skewed things a bit too much. Wish there was better education about mental health. Maybe more cases would be caught earlier. But yeah "psychotic" seems to be a synonym for "completely crazy serial killing monster". Doesn't really help the stigma. 
I was on olanzapine for years. Hated it. Made me put on 150 pounds which I since lost after being taken off it, and slept 12 hours every night. When I have an episode now I'm far better at recognising it though so I just call my emergency team numbers and it gets sorted quick. Hope it works out well for you mate 
I gained weight but not to that degree. 
I still sleep 12 hours a night.

What do the emergency responders treat you with?
It's more that they'll book an emergency appointment to see me the next day or whatever. And they'll drive up to my apartment. I've never really been overly suicidal. Normally I just need to talk to the psychiatrist for a bit
That doesn't work for me. Medication seems to be the only thing that treats it.

At the risk of getting downvoted, I really feel compelled to say that I despise comics like this. 

They don't really teach people anything, they perpetuate stigma like depressed people are miserable to be around and nobody can help them, and they foster a real sense of entitlement in the community, where everyone is supposed to walk on eggshells around depressed people because they're oh so ill. 

I have fit the label of depressed for most of my life, and I'm really really put off by this loud and obnoxious subculture of people who wish to overly dramatize and romanticize mental illness like it is so dark and horrific and everybody who suffers from it is a helpless invalid. 

Depression, like most mental illnesses, is a major challenge that many of us face, but pretty much everybody faces challenges in life.  Some people have challenges I would never trade for depression and vice versa.  I really *really* dislike this culture of making everyone see how hard done we are for [insert life challenge here].  

In particular I dislike how people always talk about the fact that depression is hard because people "don't see it".  It's true that I often feel isolated and alone because the people in my life don't know I have bipolar or PTSD.  **BUT**, the advantage is that I don't wear it on my sleeve and I don't have to worry about people treating me differently because I am bipolar because *nobody knows*.  If you live your life with a physical deformity or a stutter or in a wheelchair or blind or deaf, you will never get to experience what life is like when people don't know you are different.  People with mental health problems have a massive advantage of being able, at times, to masquerade as "a-okay". 

I do not think that ending stigma about mental illness will happen by making everyone think of us as these mysterious and dark enigmas.  It will happen by making everyone accept that, like being physically handicapped or having a chronic illness, it's a challenge we live with that requires special help and attention, but doesn't make us any different. 

In general as a person who has had mental health problems her whole life, I really *really* dislike it when people try to "speak for me" by circulating melodramatic, depressing comics about how dark and dreary I am inside.  This only serves to make people uncomfortable around us and see us differently.
That's totally fair enough man. I'm sorry something like this offends you but for many it's actually extremely difficult to even believe that other people could possibly be going through what they are, or anything remotely similar. Twee little comics like this aren't going to make a huge amount of difference of course but just seeing things like this and relating to any of the characters portrayed can really enforce a feeling that you are not isolated, you are not alone - this may be a solution in itself but it's a good enough reason for people to carry on making them in my opinion. 

I totally disagree that this makes people uncomfortable around us and see us differently - many people, still, nowadays are completely scared of confronting mental illness in any form, they think schizophrenics are psychos, depressed people are just sad, anxious people just need to get over it etc. You'd be surprised at how much of a difference seeing little things like this can make to someone who is ignorant towards mental disorders. 
Just to be clear, I'm not offended. Whoever made these comics is perfectly entitled to make and circulate them and that doesn't bother me.  I just really do not feel, as a person with several mental illnesses, that comics which portray depression in this way are spreading the kind of messages that I would like people who are ignorant about it to receive.  

>You'd be surprised at how much of a difference seeing little things like this can make to someone who is ignorant towards mental disorders.

Well my husband is one of these people.  He thinks depressed people are just sad attention seekers, and when he sees comics like this he interprets it as yet another pathetic attempt from the community to create media to guilt him into feeling bad for them.  Obviously he is just one guy, but I think it's extremely naive to think that a four panel comic will change the mind of a person who has already made a decision about what mental illness is "really like".  Look how many people live with and love people who don't understand mental illness and refuse to try.  If seeing people they love suffer with depression won't inspire them to change their attitude, then how the heck is a comic supposed to help?

Anyway, I'm not trying to argue with you.  I'm just expressing my opinion.  These types of projects irritate me.  I'm sure many people find them cathartic. 

I think the left half of my portrait would be me in bed with my dog, browsing reddit on my phone. 

Wonderful project. Thanks for sharing! 

This girl is spot on and the NHS and the work capability assessment are a shambles. In my opinion they aren't needed, if your doctor says you are unfit for work that should be enough and nothing further should be needed. Then that money given to the work capability assessment companies such as atos can be given to hire more doctors. 
To cut a long story short I feel like a different person. When I was 19 I was confident, happy, no problems with relationships. Now I feel like a timid insecure fat broke loser. This was such a long time ago that im beyond repair. Is it possible to lose your personality when you develop mental health problems? I have bipolar and I don't think im depressed. Just really really beat myself up a lot. Is it possible to never fully recover your lost personality? Im not really depressed but my self esteem is so bad. I am failing at life and its all my fault
i am in the same boat. In my teens and early 20s, i use to hang out with a bunch friends and wasn't scare to approach people with confidence. I use to date all the time, now im just scare to talk to girls at bars.....it sucks but i still believe i can change my life. 
Personalities tend to change as you go through life. It's a part of natural change. Experiences and circumstances change us. We learn new ways to adapt, to survive. Some bits will always stay the same though. If it's self esteem that you've lost, you can most certainly work on getting that back. It's just a case of lifting yourself back up again. I don't think all hope is lost at feeling yourself again. Anything you've learned, you can unlearn. Admittedly it's harder to consciously learn things, but it's totally possible. 
I feel like depression and anxiety have really sucked the soul out of my personality. I rely heavily on people remembering what I used to be like and what I used to want to do, now I'm just struggling with daily life, there's no room to be 'me'. But I do believe that bits and pieces will come together for me again. I may never take up dancing again, I might never draw again, but I might take up new hobbies, or find another valuable way to spend my time. Personalities are fluid, and that is a good thing. Yes you might not be the same as you were when you were 19 but five years from now, ten years from now, you'll be different again. Of course there will be low times and periods you don't necessarily have to be proud of, but coming out of those is possible, and that's something you can hope for, for sure. 
Thanks for writing this. I know it's hard to talk about. Episodes and mental health issues in general really do bring down a person's self esteem. There's a stigma against mental illness meaning that experiences of people with mental illness are devalued. 

It's not your fault you developed a mental illness. It's not your fault you beat yourself up. I understand it's been a long time since you felt confident and happy. I don't think you're broken. You're resilient. It takes time to recover. Stick to your meds and therapy. I hope this helps.
 Don't worry. I'm not saying it gets better. I'm just saying u become more blunt to the problems. Your mind gets extremely efficient at censoring conundrums around the golden years of age 30 onwards.
Dear flozza89, have you looked at the relationship between diet and mental health.  I have had spectacularly good results with being hard core about a ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting, and in particular eating about 5 grams of fish oil or cod liver oil every day.  Exercise of course also helps, but with a serious improvement in one's diet, nothing will help.
I know how you feel. I had a serious episode last year, and though I'm through it now, my personality never bounced back.

It's like I'm a completely different person, and I don't know how to get back to the old me. The old me was better, personality-wise. It's frustrating, but I keep hoping I can make some progress.
How old are you now?
31

It took me 2 YEARS to get a free counselor through the gov't of Canada, even though I was struggling with suicidal thoughts. Fucking pathetic.
Yeah I feel the same way. All anecdotal of course but it wasn't until my early 20s that I figured out how to navigate the system a bit to get help and by then I had my own coping strategies developed the hard way.

 Government websites are horribly outdated and hard to get around, application processes are inefficient, and around here (maritmes) resources aren't common knowledge. You know what to do if you have a broken bone but not so much if you are developing poor mental health. 

I remember hearing about the people in northern Ontario the summer before last. Hope they get help that they need soon.

I deactivated my Facebook over 2 weeks ago and I do not miss it at all. I definitely feel better for it! 
Came and went twice. If Facebook is the new opiate of the [conventional](https://www.google.com/search?q=ultracrepidarianism&oq=ultracrepidarianism&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2094j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=conventionalism) masses in the [consensus trance](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-10-steps-for-recovery-from.html), *WHY* would I want to be there other than to see on occasion what my trance-bound [attachment](https://www.google.com/search?q=ultracrepidarianism&oq=ultracrepidarianism&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2094j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=bowlby+attachment+theory) objects are doing now? (Dumping also also neatly prevents me from commenting on most utterly meaningless, but nevertheless emotion-triggering, conventional news media manipulations, saving considerable time and energy.) 
Over 2 years with no social media (aside from reddit) and it feels so much better. 
I'm literally just drifting in my apartment day in and day out. I feel like i'm in a hole. I'm very anxious and I don't talk to people besides my mom on the phone a week ago who doesn't bother talking to me because I always mention I'm feeling bad and don't know what to do and she brushes it aside every time becuase I guess she thinks I can do something about it myself... but I can't.

I've proven I'm incapable of taking initiative to anything besides my routine of waking up, eating something, like bread with butter or something lame the entire day, play video games, browse web, open the window for air, repeat. I don't feel comfortable leaving the dorm at all. I have no business in the city, i have no job, just an exam I'm underprepared for in january but no friends here.

I need help but I never seek it, and I can feel myself sink into myself every day as my thoughts ruminate so I can't enjoy anything I might've used to cope. I feel like there's a million things I want to do and should be doing but I'm afraid to and I can't because I don't function socially at all and I can never make conversations work.

Like, what do I even do. Every now and then I think about calling up my psychiatry but it's as if I don't want to. I talked to my doctor several times last year and the year before, even had CBT 1.5 years ago which helped a little but I'm way worse now for having lost so much of my life.

Fuck everything, I'm rambling. Please read and make sense of my nonsense. I need help.
I can understand what you're going through and I am really sorry that you have to go through this. Mental health issues are no joke and I am glad that you reached out in the past.

Writing this message does indicate that you do want to get better but simply don't feel like talking to your psychiatrist. This is a feeling shared by a lot of people who are suffering just like you. Your psychiatrist would want nothing more than you getting better and you really should talk to him, especially now that you have exams coming up. May I ask if there is any financial or some other issue preventing you from talking to him?

You took a positive step by taking things off of your mind a bit by writing here and I hope that you do reach out.
From what you have written here I feel like I can totally relate to you OP, that this was me a few years ago. Would you say that you don't want to speak to a psychiatrist for any particular reason? Or is it more like general apathy towards anything, really? Some more insight into this would help us giving you better advice :)

If it's more general, maybe asking someone to go with you just to a GP would be a good first step? Apathy and exhaustion, or the feeling that doing anything at all is just too overwhelming to handle / too much effort, is familiar to us with mental illness, and let's face it, it's not the ideal state to be in for too long. For me at least, finally getting the ball rolling from just talking about it to a specialist for the first time was a big big step on a journey towards finding a spark, a flavour and even excitement towards different things in life again.

For me, if I stay in a state of apathy for long, it's all quick steep downhill from there.. so I'd urge you to do something about it before it gets worse, you know? Just because then it's even harder to get out of..

A lot of introspection and multiple sources of information and support is the best thing you can do right now. It's something you can do right now to take care of your own mental and physical wellbeing. It's probably the best thing you can do for yourself right now. I mean, if the first doc is rubbish, just book with a different one. Repeat until you find one that works for you, and it will all go from there. It's just that you need to gather some strength up to do that first move. Sending you a virtual hug :))
You are suffering and can improve the quality of your life and health. You need help to do that. I highly recommend making an appointment with your psychiatrist and therapist. If you don't have either or both, see your general doctor for referrals. 

I know it's hard to reach out...but you need to get the ball rolling and you will be on your way to a better life. I wish you well. You can do this!
Get into an exercise routine. I can't stress this enough. Let this be the catalyst for the change. I would suggest, go for running. It's a mood changer. And challenge yourself in your running routine. Always try to do extra and don't allow yourself to settle. Please take this suggestion to heart and it will take you out of the ditch.
 
If one was invalidated, insulted, rejected, disclaimed, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, victimized, demonized, persecuted, [scapegoated]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=scapegoating+in+families), and/or otherwise abused by others in early life, they may have been [in-struct-ed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=social%20constructionism), [programmed]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mind+programming), [conditioned](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=operant+classical+conditioning), [socialized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=socialization+psychology) and/or [normalized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=normalization+social+psychology) to a mental state of [learned helplessness](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=learned+helplessness). Having worked with a lot of depressed people, I'd say that what I just described is what happened about 95% of the time. 

If one can use something like the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) or some other "instant clarifier" to be able to [see themselves as they are and *why*](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/04/critical-thinking-and-logical-fallacies.html) (such conditioning as described above?), they are usually able to move up from the first or second of the [five stages of therapeutic recovery](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-five-stages-of-recovery.html) into the third and even the fourth. And once they get there, it's just a matter of...

1) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do the next six things on this list: Find a board certified psychopharmacologist in your area by using the clinician locator on the *Psychology Today* website. Getting psych meds from a GP or primary care doc can be useless or even risky. Psych diagnoses, meds and med interactions are just too complex now for most GPs and primary care docs.

2) Support Groups: [AA](http://www.aa.org/), [MA](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/) and/or [NA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=narcotics+anonymous) if one is using intoxicants to try to cope with emotional pain; [ACA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=adult+children+of+alcoholics), [EA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=emotions+anonymous) and [CoDA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=coda.org)... where you will find others in similar boats who have found explanations, answers and solutions.

3) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). *Accurate* information is power. 

4) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden's [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) as the [interoceptive](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=interoception+meditation) 9th of the [10 StEPs](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing), but had good results over the years with several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [CPT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy), and [schema therapy]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), as well as [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [HBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html).

DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the trauma.

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look [here]( https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/), and [here]( http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry), and [here]( https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), and (for DBT specialists in particular) [here]( http://behavioraltech.org/resources/crd.cfm). If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Most MD / psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often -- though not always -- excellent sources of referral. 

5) Mindfulness Meditation: Try the [Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81)-style? (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, this stuff handles anxiety chop chop. Not sure about depression. Many of the modern psychotherapies for anxiety are actually based on it now.)

6) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=DBT+therapy+workbooks).

7) Moderate exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to "massage" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.
I struggle with getting up early enough to actually call within opening times. It's ridiculous it's only between 9-12am for the most part, but I will do it... again, lol. It feels like I get through the conversation and then when I get my referral to a psychiatrist I call up once and then drop it if it doesn't immediately go through.

I received a letter from a psychiatric clinic two weeks ago saying I had to respond back if I wanted a time IN MAY 2017 within two weeks, which is absolute bullshit when I'm struggling right now, so I messaged my GP again if I could get referred to someplace else and she never responded so I just sorta dropped it, but I guess I have to retry.
I'm curious, where did you find your spark?
Thanks for the very, quite overwhelming post! I've already opened some of the links. I can feel myself resisting to seek my psychiatrist because I don't just want meds and I know that's where I'll end. If there is a way for me to motivate myself and get up and moving again, I'd rather do that. I think i'll save your post just in case.

EDIT: Hmm. I read some of the links, the StEP one, and... eh. It's a bunch of all or nothing. It's poorly phrased and not very helpful, sorry.
In all honesty, what got me out of the deepest rut of apathy comes in pill form. Specifically, the combo of venlafaxine with mirtazapine, also affectionately knows as "California rocket fuel" - named so for a very good reason. It took me years of trying different meds (SSRIs, SNRIs, venlafaxine alone etc.) and therapy to finally arrive at a combination of treatments that really works. But the response to treatment and the ideal meds and type of therapy are highly individual, and should be considered on case by case basis. Turns out my depression and anxiety are of treatment-resistant type - which just means it took me a bit longer than most people to arrive at the point of feeling better. It does *not* mean it is untreatable.

Getting my medication sorted did not erase my problems, but it gave me a base-level of energy to start doing things again, and to start enjoying things again. From there it's pretty easy - things like listening to or mixing my favourite tunes, going for a hike with my dog, socialising a bit, cooking, playing volleyball at a club, learning a new language, watching movies or being creative - I can enjoy and be passionate about such hobbies again.

I literally just sat down and wrote down a list of things that I enjoyed and want to do more of, and things that I want to learn to do / become better at. Then came the realization that making time for these things is good for me and super important for my mental health, life satisfaction, self-development and balance in my life.

 I'm a PhD student, so that obviously takes up most of my time. I used to just sacrifice everything for academic achievement and be a perfectionist, not taking care of my mental or physical well-being. That did not end well. I almost failed my course and it all culminated in an ambivalent suicide attempt. Then I took 1 year of medical leave from uni, a time-out, as I had had enough and I couldn't go on living like that. So for that year I made time for therapy, my hobbies, friends I had neglected. I lived back at home with family, worked at Starbucks for a few months and saved some money and went back-packing Asia and Australia for 2 months (lived in hostels, took buses down the Oz East Coast, lived off oatmeal and PBJs).

Just that change of scenery, seeing so many amazing places and meeting different and interesting people was a massive spark in and of itself. I just needed something like that the shake me and get me out of my miserable bubble. It was just so good to see that there's just so much more to life and to the world, and to me. I grew so much self-confidence. I look at my life, my goals and aspirations differently. Now my main goal is not some qualification or unrealistically high standard I've set for myself. My main goal is to try my best to do the things that will enhance my physical and mental well-being.

Sorry about the long block of text, but perhaps some of it is helpful for someone. :))
No need to be sorry, that was a great answer. 

I'm finishing my undergraduate next year, and I can totally relate to your story. Starting it three years ago, frankly speaking, I envied my classmates going to good university. At first I was charged with it to pursue good grades in my uni, but then it all sort of collapsed. Last studying year was so hard, I just can't start learning. I enjoy the subjects, but I can't simply start doing stuff. With such attitude I inevitably got bad performance. Now I'm in search for some invigorating force to pump me up.

I didn't take any medicine and I'm can't use my parent's money to do it. Although I went to psychiatrist. Can't go to him anymore, its to costly.

I guess I should convince myself to go to work and earn dome trips abroad to breathe foreign air.


Thank you for your story.
So you're in your last year of undergrad now? Yeah the final year is really tough, and I guess the motivating force is the sheer stress of final exams getting closer. Not wanting to fail any of my subjects was certainly a kick in the ass lol.

What helps to keep the spirits up is to have something nice to look forward to once you're done. Make sure you take the time to relax and take care of yourself, too. When the sheer amount of material to learn seems overwhelming, it's all about breaking it down into small, achievable goals. Instead of thinking "omg I've got 50 lectures in x subject I've got to learn", think "ok, this week I focus on learning these 3 lectures - if I can do that, I'll be fine". Also be smart about focusing on studying the most important stuff. If you can get some past final exam questions that's great for seeing what questions seem to come up every year. Your lecturers might drop some hints as well. I literally didn't even study a bunch of lectures from each subject that were not likely to come up on the exam and I could afford to drop. Less workload. Got away with it hehe.

Back to having something nice to look forward to. I find it helps me persevere through intensely stressful times. Perhaps you could get a summer job and then hit the road? Maybe you'll be so exhausted by the end you'll just want to chill and enjoy your summer instead, and think about all that stuff after. Do you want to do a post-grad degree? You could apply for a scholarship abroad in Europe or Asia. There are great Masters or PhDs, or indeed both offered in English, in countries like Germany with virtually no course fees. You can get fully sponsored to study in Seoul, South Korea. There's so many options out there - it's worth looking into at any rate..!

Done with studying after undergrad? How about doing teaching English as a foreign language job in Japan, China or Vietnam for a year or two? As a native English speaker you don't even need qualifications, and your undergrad degree will give you an advantage. You get a nice salary, your accommodation and visas are all sorted by the school. How about a 2-year work and travel visa in Australia or New Zealand? You can earn $25 AUD per hour in a hospitality job. You can afford to work part-time. You can also work for accommodation and some meals in almost any hostel, 10h per week, and it's a great way to meet new people and make friends.

Assuming you're in the US, that's really shit that you can't get the help you'd like. I study in Europe, so I appreciate it's a bit different. How about your university - do you have a university health centre? Is it any different in one of those? How about your local mental health charities? Perhaps they run some free CBT or group therapy courses you could join. Does your uni have a student mental health society? Mine does, and we do positivi-tea meetings every Sunday for peer support in a relaxed atmosphere.

Do you have a trusted friend who knows about your mental health struggles? It's super useful to have a contact like that even if you're not like bffs. I have an arrangement with my ex (we separated on good terms and are friends). We have a code, that if I send a text message consisting of just a dot . it means I'm feeling low or struggling - they know what the code means, and will call me whenever they get the chance for a chat. Then, of course you should know your local mental health crisis team's number for more serious lows. These are free of charge.

With medication, you could search your uni's research webpages to see if they've got any clinical trials going. They could be testing new antidepressant medications or doing efficacy comparison tests or whatever. My mum got venlafaxine treatment for her depression like that when it was new, free of charge. Not to mention they usually pay you nice money just for taking part. (I did an abstinence from smoking trial for two days, did some surveys and got 200$ for a little bit of discomfort.)

Finally, you could give a shot at crowd-funding if worst comes to worst.

Edit: If you want to do postgrad, then; think that if you gather your strength and do well in this last stretch, then you have every chance of doing a postgrad in a better university if you wanted to. Yet another motivating factor, no? :)

Edit2: omg can't believe I forgot about this one: get a self-help therapy book! There's tonnes, and granted some are better than others, but there's great ones for things like CBT, mindfulness etc. etc. Your local bookstore or library will have a selection of these. Plenty of resources online as well, try the UK charity MIND web page for useful, free resources. Many of these will teach you exactly the same stuff you'd get in some therapies.
Dear BogusProfiterole, I'm so thankfull for all your replies! Thank you for all the suggestions!

I'm from western Russia, but basicly, I assume, most points still valid for me. Although regarding the teaching part, it might be Russian instead English. I heard people in China are looking forward to learn our language.

I've been dreaming about studying in Europe, but there are different factors which fear me. First one is rejection. Although practicaly getting decline does not really matter to me, I'm subconciously in fear of getting it. Next is migration, although I know stories of Russians coming to France and Germany, and they say locals are kind to them, I'm sort of afraid to be a persona non grata.

Anyway, from this year, I'll start from upgrading myself. My university does not provide any of such kind of support, unfortunately.

For me, the only stopping power is a fear of failure and fear of rejection. They make me feel strenghless in face of challenges. I had a though this month, that sport can sort of help me with this? One medical condition complemented my depression a lot, and I think maybe boosting my imune system can give some relief.

Enough about myself. I'm sorry for not replying for too long. I could not put it all together. I would like to say you seem like  a very good person. I have never met someone online, who could provide all of these suggestions to a complete stranger, replying to a short sentence =)

Although a little bit late, I wish you and your family the best to come this year, strong health and miriads of joyfull moments to happen with you! Thank you, dear BogusProfiterole!


I've been dealing with a lot lately. I know a lot of people have it a lot worse than I do, but that's no excuse to not seek help. For a really long time I had the thought process that if I sought out help, that I was weak, or validating that I had serious mental issues, which isn't the case at all! 

Last month, I kind of hit a low. I've started coming to terms with my sexuality, coming out to people, and handling a lot more personal issues, many of which were not good. I realized that I needed someones help, but I felt like I couldn't confide in the people I knew in my life, or that it wasn't fair to dump all my problems on them. Whatever the reasoning, I found a therapist online, and very, very hesitantly set up an appointment for earlier today. I was scared, really scared actually. I was shaking before I even headed into the building, but I told myself that I needed to go in.

I headed in, filled out some paperwork, and waited. My therapist came, asked for me, and introduced himself. We made our way back to his office, having a little small-talk and sat down.

I opened up like a book. Here I am, sitting in front of a complete stranger, and feeling no hesitance towards telling him some deeply, personal things. I couldn't stop talking honestly, and 2 1/2 hours absolutely flew by. In this one session, I had already felt a million times better than the day before!

I definitely have a lot more to say, so I set up another appointment. But I think it's safe to say this was a really good decision.

This is fantastic news! Well done. It sounds like this has been a really positive thing for you and I'm really pleased it has helped. Talking can be so therapeutic and therapists often have a way of making you feel at ease and helping you to open up. Keep going, keep talking. If it helps then keep doing it! Congratulations on your little success.
Good for you! I just called a therapist for the first time today, too, and I hope I have the same experience as you. My problems always find a way to burden others whether I'm silent about them or not, it seems, and it's definitely time to sit down with a professional.

All the best with your continued progress!
Thank you all. I've been feeling much better lately.

If anyone's curious, the main reason I went is because I've recently started coming out as gay. I've had a mindset that being gay is wrong my whole life, so this was a pretty big deal, and something I was having a lot of trouble coping with.

After going, I've accepted who I am, and have even started putting myself out there. Doing that after 23 years of not even trying and being afraid is different, but I've already got a date and I'm really excited!

I haven't told my family about it as I don't want them to worry that something is really wrong with me, but they aren't exactly the best people to talk to about this kind of stuff anyways. Coming out to them was hard enough, and not to mention that my family has a history of problems with mental issues.
For you (and u/quicklittlethrow , as well): I have been working with the anxious, depressed and manic for almost 30 years. I have yet to meet one who hadn't been [in-struct-ed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=social%20constructionism), [programmed]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mind+programming), [conditioned](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=operant+classical+conditioning), [socialized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=socialization+psychology) and/or [normalized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=normalization+social+psychology) to believe *in* shame and that he or she was *a*shamed for some *reason* (or collection of them). Shame is nothing more than the emotional result of what I just listed above. It's *really common* in this culture because it is so widely used to by parents (who were themselves conditioned, etc.) to control their children, having no idea whatsoever that the results in their children will be pretty much the same as in *them*. 

People *can* get out of the [consensus trance](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=consensus+trance+charles+tart) of shame, guilt, worry, regret, remorse, morbid reflection, self-loathing and resulting secret-keeping. Here's how:

1) Support Groups: [ACA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=adult+children+of+alcoholics), [EA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=emotions+anonymous) and [CoDA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=coda.org)... where you will find others in similar boats who have found explanations, answers and solutions.

2) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). *Accurate* information is power. 

3) Medications *only if needed*: Find a board certified psychopharmacologist in your area by using the *Psychology Today* locator on their website. Do NOT get psych meds from a GP or PC doc. Psych diagnoses, meds and med interactions are too complex now for GPs and PC docs.

4) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden's [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) as the [interoceptive](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=interoception+meditation) 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing), but had good results over the years with several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), and [schema therapy]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), as well as [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [BCP/MCSP]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html).

5) Mindfulness Meditation: Try the [Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81)-style. (For a *lot* of people, this stuff handles anxiety, grief, shame, depression and all that chop chop. Many of the modern psychotherapies -- including several of the ones listed above -- are based on it now.)

6) Therapy Workbooks: I made terrific headway using inexpensive workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=DBT+therapy+workbooks).

7) Moderate exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of all those beliefs for a while.

Im sorry for your loss. This is a beautiful way to remember your friend tho' and bring some good from his passing. 
This is be
This was heartwarming. Thank you for sharing. 
This is beautiful. I am sorry for your loss. It looks like great things can come from the foundation too. 

No fucking way! 


YOU DON'T SAY
Thank you for posting this! Great article
Well yeah. They're cops not therapists. They try though. Most have good intentions. 
It's becoming more frequent and has become cuss words. I am getting worried. What is this and what should I do about it?
I do the same thing. It is not Tourette Syndrome, but I have never found an accurate label. Luckily, for me I do not usually do it around other people - only in private. However, when I'm around others (like my wife), my brain substitutes the random loud words with a fart noise. I promise I'm not saying this to be funny. This is completely true.
someone i am close to does this and describes them as "wince words". It seems to be fairly common. therapy/counselling might be the way to go.
I don't really have any insight to offer. Only wanted to mention that this has been happening for me over the past couple of years or so, I'd say. Seems like it mostly happens at home but it is happening with more frequency outside the house as well, albeit usually in more mundane ways.

My layman's interpretation of this is that it's a reaction to intrusive thoughts. I have pretty bad social anxiety, so when memories pop up in my head of times when I was awkward or said the "wrong" thing, I get a pretty strong anxious reaction. If that's true, then I'd bet that a therapist could do a great deal with cognitive behavioral therapy. But so far this hasn't caused me enough worry to get it checked out.
I have the exact same problem, and I'm looking for a label.   
I've noticed that the random words were usually specific to the situation.  
I am able to suppress it most of the time and display only a grimace with no actually said word.  
But when I'm alone or deep in though it slips by and I vocalize.
I do this, but make a noise instead of saying words. 

I have randomly read of other people who experience this also. Here's an old thread, for example:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/8p8pz/when_i_remember_something_embarrassing_from_my/
I do the same, except that I always say, "Suicide is my favourite thing. I've committed it hundreds of times" under my breath without even noticing it. For me, it started out as something conscious. I'd always whisper horrible things to myself if I ever thought of something embarrassing or if I thought of one of my many flaws. Then it became a habit. I think one thing that can help (and has helped) is to counteract it every time it happens. After you shout something out, say, "It's in the past. It doesn't matter anymore," or something like that. Over time, you'll begin to send a message to yourself. It's helped me - it might help you. Peace brother x
Try replacing the words with a sound in your head like the commonly used "om" in meditation and visualize something tranquil at the same time (waves crashing, a forest, etc). If your intrusive thoughts are specifically linked to being inadequate, come up with a corresponding mantra you say in your head such as "we're all imperfect" or "I am very good at XYZ." 

Using the "om" sound coupled with a tranquil image is a way to sit with and work through your discomfort in peace. Applying a mantra (perhaps even google a general positive affirmations list) is an example of thought stopping, an intervention that may be suggested by a CBT therapist.

Last, although there is a possibility these "wince words" (or whatever the thing is) are a symptom of a mental illness, it's much more likely they are simply a behavioral response to an emotional trigger - any coping mechanism that doesn't hurt any body else is super healthy in my book. 


I do this as well. I only say one phrase or variations of it: "Do things to die." If I'm alone, I let it out. If I'm around others I can hold it in, but sometimes I'll make a little grunt or humming noise against my will.

Honestly, from what I've read here, it's more common than you might think. Definitely could be something to discuss with a therapist though.
I can only empathise as I do this too. Though I find myself talking to my cats even when they're not around. Some kind of crazy coping mechanism where I vocalise about something nice to suppress the horrible stuff and not deal with it. 
I have to stop myself after embarassing social situations because I WILL make a little squirt noise with my mouth. It's always accompanied by a feeling of "oh shit that was awful". 

I feel like it's related to Tourettes, like it's a result of the same brain system. Or rather, a less pathological expression of the same problem, a milder form?

PAGING SCIENTISTS WEEOOWEEOO 
I have the same thing here, and I've done a lot of embarrassing things. I also get some sort of a shiver in my bones when I remember the embarrassing scenario, and how dumb I was in it. 
It progressed over the years, now I find myself cussing in the morning, and or screaming out large numbers. I have sort of my own analysis, but no way near professional enough to share it. But I'm wondering about our age? I'm 33 it started a couple of years ago, and I've been going through real tough times. Feeling helpless, what about you? 
Honestly, it's sort of a relief to see so many people who do this, too. Mine are usually pretty basic like "Oh God" or "No, no, no" or a groan or a curseword, but sometimes it'll be something random or nonsensical or a few notes of a melody. Anything to abruptly shut down the thought or prevent it from escaping my lips. Judging from the comments here (and linked threads about it), OP and myself are not alone by a long shot, so I guess it's fairly common/normal? Phew!
Hey. I have approximately same problem. I think of something embarrassing that happened to me even years ago and, instead of saying something, I make a  weird grimace and cover my eues with my hands. It seems to be OCD-related. I have other symptoms too (intrusive thoughts and checking). I have had these for years and I don't need to be medicated.
I clap my hands to cope with the awkward memories.
I'm in no way an expert, but this sounds like one of the symptoms of Tourette syndrome. But label or no label: it's probably a good idea to see a doctor about this. 
It could be an indication of mild PTSD symptoms. You may be holding on to past experiences that were not properly dealt with. I don't have professional experience on the topic, but it may be worth it to seek professional assistance/guidance.
Don't worry I'm not laughing. In public my substitutes have been coughs, "I'm tired", or curse words. When I visited my parents, they thought I needed to see a doctor because I was "tired" so often. 
I have social anxiety to the point of agoraphobia. Before I got on meds if I was out in public (only to certain places and only with my wife) I would become terrified I was going to shout something inappropriate and then involuntarily I would suddenly say "anyway!" for no reason when I hadn't even been speaking. My guess is your trouble is related and as others have noted, stems from social anxiety.  
Not op, but I'm going to try this. Thanks for the recommendation!
I considered Tourettes too. I don't make inaudible clicks/noises however, only random articulated words. I'm thinking of seeing a doctor too though. Thank you for the reply.
To clarify: I don't mind if you laugh :) I just don't want you to think I'm lying to try to be a comedian!
It *might* be Tourette Syndrome. Have you ever been tested for it? Do you have any motor tics? 
You can show symptoms of a certain illness without actually having said illness. That doesn't make your problems any less valid. I hope you can get the help you need :)

LOL I call those squishys!! You can find them in the toy lanes in dollar stores, walmart, 5 below etc..
I have some of these for my clients and they are called [Puffer Balls](http://www.trainerswarehouse.com/Puffer-Ball/productinfo/FIPUF/). I find that they are great for anxious clients--and I also highly recommend [Thinking Putty](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games&field-keywords=thinking+putty). 
it's a stress ball, many to choose from here: http://www.officeplayground.com/stress-balls-c9.html
[This](http://www.childrenstherapystore.com/relaxus_thera_ball_hand_therapy_massage_balls.html) is the closest I could find. Does that seem similar to you?
I believe it's called a plumbus.
I've had those, they were fun
It looks like on of those dryer softener balls.
My therapist doesn't have them but it would be so great! Because I'm very anxious and maybe playing with it and talking will calm me down 
Looks like a dog toy.
[deleted]
Haha they ARE squishy for sure! The only thing I'm having trouble is the finding the squishies with putty inside. Do you happen to know if the ones you've encountered are just air, or do they have that awesome putty stuff in the interior? 
Do you know if the puffer balls have the putty inside? The ones you've linked advertise just air. This one seems to have thinking putty inside the puffer ball, which is a pretty awesome combination. :) Thank you for the links!
I think OP means one specifically filled with putty.

I've used a lot of stress balls and this is the first time I've seen putty inside. It's normally air or goo - maybe micro beads, but never putty.
Thanks, I've looked through that website though and none of them have the putty inside. But they are very close!
It is similar, but I don't think this one has air and putty; I think it's just small beads. Which is probably amazing, but I was hoping to find that specific toy. Thank you very much for the link though!
So helpful.


Still upvoted.
*"Gnawsome Squeaker Balls feature a loud internal squeaker"* 

how relaxing
The one OP is referring to is really squishy and would not last with a dog. The one in your link would be a harder and thicker plastic
Unfortunately I don't think it's that; they look similar though. This one does not have a squeaker, and the rubber is so soft that I think a dog would chew right through it. Thank you though!
Now thats a tough one. I never felt them up enough to check LOL. No harm in going exploring to find your one and only squishy :)
This may be common knowledge but if it ends up helping just one person then it will have been worth it. I first became depressed in my early teens and had a very difficult time getting through school. My school had quite a strong focus on academic success and I had major issues with motivation and concentration. I was introduced to medications at around 15 years old via Prozac which I found to be ineffective and numbing. I tried several other meds and none of them were particularly helpful. Things got worse and worse until last summer when I tried to kill myself.

My parents found out and they immediately committed me to a mental hospital where my will to live was certainly not restored. It was only after a lengthy spell there that the resident psychiatrist decided to send me for an MRI. He had described my affliction as an atypical depression and was unsure of what else to do. At the time, I felt like a mentally healthy person trapped in the body of a mentally unhealthy person. It was strange.

Anyway, the MRI showed that I had an arachnoid cyst in the back of my head that was displacing my cerebellum and pushing the rest of my brain forward so that it was sort of squished up against the front of my skull. The cyst itself was about the size of a cigarette packet. My parents immediately took me to see a neurosurgeon. He was initially reluctant to commit to anything as he felt that the link between the cyst and my psychological issues was tenuous. Eventually I convinced him to operate and he put in a shunt which drains down into my abdominal cavity. A post CT scan showed a significant reduction in the size of the cyst. It's still early days but I feel a marked improvement in my overall mood and would be confident that there will be further improvement.

I understand that this is not an option available to everyone that may read this but if you have been suffering for months or years with depression and medications have not had much of an effect I would urge you to at least consider getting a scan. What I gather from the psychiatrist who I have been visiting recently, is that this scenario is more common than I had originally believed. Lots of people may be walking around with small, benign cysts in their heads and not notice a thing. She said she has had two patients with almost identical symptoms who had the same problem and have fully recovered. Sometimes they don't present any physical symptoms at all. I tried posting this to the depression subreddit but it was against their rules :/ Just food for thought anyway. Thanks for reading! 

Edit: removed some potentially harmful description of my suicide attempt
Or tumors. After major head aches and never ending vertigo, I was prescribed migraine meds, daily allergy meds, and offered antidepressants. 
Nothing g helped and I was walking g around with sunglasses on indoors. 
I was finally sent for an MRI after I had double vision and we found a benign tumor. As soon as it gets big enough we will be radiating it to death :)

getting one in a week exactly 
[deleted]
My hypochondriac senses are tingling, maybe I'll tell my doc about this. My meds finally kicked in last week, so I should be fine, shouldn't I? Anyway, thanks for posting this. 


That's really helpful information but I'm afraid that since reading about suicide methods is a trigger to suicidal thoughts for so many people (like me a few months ago) that they won't keep reading. I'm not sure if there's a way to spoiler text on this sub but it would be better that way.
I will ask for a ct scan
Nice one! Hope it turns out ok
Yeah, I do too actually. It's become so easy to get scans nowadays if you have insurance/enough money. I was disappointed that it took so long until someone finally considered it as an option
There doesn't seem to be any upper spinal development issues and my neurosurgeon seems to be satisfied that the cyst didn't form that way. I'm not very familiar with that type of malformation though so who knows
Yeah I was worried I might cause some people to worry about this. It really is rather unlikely that anything will show up. Great to hear the meds are working though!
I made a request to the author, taking into consideration this concern. The author disagrees with the premise but very graciously accommodated the request by removing the specific method. 
You never know :)

Interesting video. Thanks for the link! It is strange how much separation many psychiatrists seem to have from the physical properties of the brain. It's almost like they're unaware that there is a link between the psychological and the physiological
Posts such as "Do I have *mental health disorder*?" And similar should not be allowed on this subreddit.

It is impossible and, in my view, unethical for users to speculate as to whether or not a poster has a particular mental health disorder. Doing so can cause misinformation, and may prevent posters from getting the help and correct diagnosis they need. 

Many redditors recognize this and say such in their comments to the posts, but sometimes the posts spawn unverified, non-reputable speculation that is better stated by a doctor. 

What do y'all think?
[deleted]
I agree, it blocks up the main page as well which can be annoying. Of course it will require stricter modding than we've been seeing. 
Ban is a bit strong. I'd say it might be appropriate to have some sort of canned, non-commital response. But the whole point of this sub is "sharing information about mental health, illness, wellness, etc".

Seems to me that it's really only a problem if people responding try to play doctor. They're the ones who you should target, IMO.

I'm torn. I don't post often, but I have posted in this sub. I've also probably told someone that I agreed they needed assistance. I tend to not look at the "am I" posts because it's hard to tell if someone has a true mental health issue or if it's situational. I've typically replied to folks who already have a diagnosis, again not all. 

This sub is a tricky one for banning certain posts. You never know if this one 'reach out' is the one that helps them get the help they need. Even if a mod gives info on what to do, with links to help sites, they may walk away feeling more alone at a time when they need someone talking to them. There are any number of reason's a person may not seek profession help at this moment, to turn them away seems wrong some how. 

I was bound to have mental health issues, my mom was nuts, my sister bi-polar and my father had major depressive disorder. It was a friend who took note and talked me into seeing a doctor. I was in my 30's. I wouldn't have considered it if it weren't for him diagnosing my issues. If you have mental health issues, you do know more than the average joe, but, I agree, we shouldn't diagnose anyone, but sometimes agreeing with their own assessment is enough to get them to a doctor or therapist. 

tl;dr  No, I don't think "am I' posts should be banned. This may be their one reach out that will spur them to getting seen by a professional. 

Please, folks, don't down vote people because they disagree with OP. This is a valid question and people who disagree have valid viewpoints. (I've noticed folks getting down-voted). Use the up-vote instead for the view you agree with. 


I think we should ban them but encourage users to post about their behaviors and recieve feedback in the form of referals. Instead of "what's my diagnosis " they say "who can I go to"
Yes.  But refer them to another source of assistance.
No, we should ban *answers* to those posts that are purely speculative.

The description of the sub is "a safe place to discuss, vent, support, and share information about mental health" – if people can't ask the questions they have, we're not fitting that description.

I don't want all answers to be banned either. Normally people are better off talking to professionals, but getting access to those professionals can be difficult and/or prohibitively expensive for many. Giving advice on navigating a difficult medical landscape is not unethical.
I'm the moderator of /r/BPD.  I banned diagnosis posts about a year ago when we started to see them almost every day.  Now, after I delete these submissions, I have a few pre-written messages that I customize and send to the submitter.  These messages explain to the submitter why (unfortunately) their question is not answerable over the internet, give them advice regarding how to schedule an appointment with a mental health professional, and encourage them to utilize the subreddit for support nonetheless.  I've never had any problems with this and I think it's the best solution for this problem.

There are a few issues with allowing these submissions to stay up: 1. despite how vigilant the mods are, there will always responses that offer diagnoses; and 2. the well-meaning people who do explain that diagnosis is not possible often don't leave as comprehensive of an explanation as the one that a mod could send.  It seems best to respond to these people in a uniform fashion and make sure that their needs are being met.  I'm not sure how active this sub's moderator is, so that would really be the only issue.
[deleted]
I offered to help mod since I'm pretty active on this sub and have modding experience on this and other accounts. No reply. Of course, the mod hasn't posted in over 20 days so who knows if they even saw it.

I wish I knew how I could help. 
The comments made me so angry. People telling him to just exercise because that will make him feel better, or that his problems are nothing and he needs to snap out of it - one guy even said that he wouldn't be surprised if Tom killed himself!

I cried watching this video. I just wanted to give him a hug, agree with him that everything sucks and ask him what he wants to do today.
this video will probably get taken down pretty quickly by Tom himself
This man should be an ambassador for the depressed. Exactly how I feel right now.

I think most of Reddit is actually quite like this.
Is there any way to send him a PM?
Same here. My heart is breaking for him.
I can't stand it. He made himself vulnerable to people and they're acting so heartless. 

Yeah I wanna help him get back on his feet too...

One thing he didn't mention in the vid is that his friend Ed passed away from cancer a few years ago...he has lost a lot of relationships and I'm afraid for him. I just want him to be okay. I remember watching his vids when none of this had happened...he was a totally different person.
You're right :( 
I didn't watch it because I'm not too familiar with the guy, but he has a video from 2013 titled "I am depressed" and it started off the same way as this one. It will probably stay up but I could be wrong. 
It's so hard for people to understand depression if they've never experienced it. Plus I think it varies from person to person...some people have that number feeling a lot, and others feel sad constantly, or both. Once you've been in either place you can understand why someone would eat a lot or hurt themself or isolate themself from friends or kill themself.
> I think most of Reddit is actually quite like this.

Depressed?
Maybe, but I'm not sure if he'll even see it...
Oh god, the poor guy. I wish there was some way us fans could help out. He doesn't need money, he needs support but when you're that low it's hard to be gotten through to.
It's a terrible disease of the mind. Something to do with how our lifestyles have changes over the last few thousand years.

Time enough to reflect perhaps.
Yeah :( I have absolutely no idea what to do...

Very poor article. It actually encourages the "oh poor my I've been born with depression and gotta take a pill everyday to be happy" attitude. She states that it's a chemical imbalance, which the majority of the time is false. Only 16% or less of depression is an inherent chemical imbalance of the brain, and it's actually been proven that your thought patterns can alter your brain chemistry. Depression is from cognitive distortions, don't forget! Knowing this will help you cure yourself.

I recommend reading "Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy" it has helped me tons.

This was very good to read, and actually answered a lot of the questions I had about schizophrenia. Thanks! 
Great article, really brought me back to my time in psych care. Really straight talk about mental illness.
Great article. More people should read this. The best part was his learned lesson to not fear a relapse because recovery is possible.
WHY ARE WE SHOUTING? 

Just kidding, great article!
That was a good article, thanks for sharing.
"That night in bed, though, I started trembling like it was freezing cold—only my skin was boiling."  sounds like the dopamine rush.  get that when i don't take my meds.  it's not a pleasant sensation.  I've never heard of acute scizophrenia before, I thought it was always a chronic disease?  good article though, that site has some great stuff.  thanks for submitting this.
I believe it's a specifier in the DSM. That may be different in the medical diagnostic handbooks, perhaps its separate. But I believe the DSM uses something similar as a specifier to the main diagnosis of schizophrenia, and it has more to do with the onset than meaning it's a short-term illness. 
Thats what ive been feeling as long as I can remember.

I cant be productive, cant hold a steady job, cant make friends, no wife, no childern, no girlfriend and everything I seem to do for myself just ends up in shambles.

Ive failed so much... learned a lot, still failed at the next thing to come around the corner.

Its getting hard man, really hard and ive been doing this for 23 years
yeah, im in a basically constant brain fog / dissociative state and have been for a decade.  somehow i manage to keep a really cool engineering job, but it's not even like i notice.  its a little dissimilar from "going through the motions" since my work varies, but its all constant flow in one ear out the other type things.

i think ive accomplished all i cared to and now im just sitting around waiting to die in some freak accident.
Yes, yes I do. But, I recently started going back to therapy. Plus, I finally caved in and admitted that I need to keep my anxiety meds at a high dose.
Have you thought about seeing a professional? It's really not as big a deal as people make it out to be. They've talked with 100s of people who have dealt with those very same feelings, and can provide good insight.

Some simple lifestyle changes can have a huge impact on mood. Sometimes talking therapy can be really enlightening. There could even be a biological (and easily fixable) issue.

Also, if you don't "click" with a therapist after a few sessions. Don't be afraid to shop around! You wouldn't take your car to a shitty mechanic right? Your brain and this life are your most valuable possessions -treat them well.
I think so, we all are terminal from the day we are born, Yet we often wish not to be aware many of us are.
Yeah. I find no joy in life. I do have kids and they make me happy to a degree. But I feel totally removed from life, I'm just exsisting. 
I get what you mean. Every day just blends into the next but at the same drags on forever. It's really soul crushing and exhausting.
Keep trying.  I know it sucks.  Eventually things will start to improve.  You're still very young.
yes

I've found myself in that exact situation a number of times, and it's minor things that I would miss that end up getting me to delay checking out a little bit longer.  Keeping a list handy sounds like a good idea.  Kind of like a bucket list, but instead of "things I'd like to do before I kick the bucket", it would be "instead of kicking the bucket".
I read The Hobbit coincidentally when I was going through a lonely period although I'm not saying it helped in any way. It was the first big book I read and I did it within a day because it was so good.

I was suicidal once and put it off for one day to see if things were really as bad as I imagined. They weren't, and I've been able to take it easy and find fun stuff to do since.
My mom has a phrase she always says when I tell her I'm depressed. "This too shall pass". I fucking hate that phrase. I know it'll pass, but it always comes back. Always.

I am what my doctor calls a "rapid cycler". Although I'm not technically bipolar (I have schizoaffective disorder, a mix of schizophrenia and bipolar). I had somewhat control over my illness when I was a teenager, even though I still ended up in the hospital once or twice a year. When I turned 18, everything changed, and I don't know why. I started having depressive episodes at random, where there used to be a pattern. Since I turned 18, I've been in the hospital upwards of 20 times. I'm 22. For a while, around when I turned 20, a new pattern formed. A depressive episode every three months, followed by a month long manic episode, then normal for a month, and then I'd start sliding again. Every time I ended up in the hospital. When I was 21 I was admitted to my provincial psychiatric hospital for 4 months. I thought it helped. It did not. Along with suicidal thoughts and self harm, I started having homicidal thoughts. Everyone I saw, from total strangers to people I loved, I wanted to cause endless pain to. To torture them until they screamed for mercy, and died sobbing for help. Obviously, I ended up back in my local psych ward. Now there's no pattern anymore. I can't track my lows and highs, and it seems I'm never "normal". I'm either depressed, manic, or so anxious I can't even face my roommates. All I want to do is cut myself until I bleed the pain away. My mom says I'm doing better, that I've found better coping mechanisms. That's not true. I've just found other bad coping mechanisms. I hide in my room, sleep all day, stay up all night, and scream into my pillow until I'm hoarse. I desperately want to die, because I know I'll never be able to lead a normal, functional life like this. I am a leech off society. I live in a group home for the mentally ill, and survive off of social assistance because I can't hold down a job because I end up having a breakdown and quitting after three months when I inevitably end up back in the hospital. How am I supposed to live like that? It's not even living, all I'm doing right now is surviving, and I'm tired of it. I'd rather die than survive another day. My life is hopeless. I'll never achieve the things I dreamed and hoped for, because mental illness has ruined my life, and I don't want to live anymore. 
I appreciated hearing your story. 

Normalcy is a myth, beware of its tyranny. 

"It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society" 
The only reason I am alive right now is because of my animal companion. I'd kill the shit out of myself if she wasn't here with me. So I have accepted that, while I want to not exist, I also am going to live my life with my cat to its fullest. My life might be shit but fuck it if she can't have a great lil cat life. 

Remembering the fact that nothing actually fucking matters or has inherent purpose comforts me in a way. It helps when I'm feeling really insane to remember it and just think to myself, "Hey bitch fucking chill. YOLO".

I am in the same boat as I am just not sure where/what to do now. It's terrible that things have to have the financial capability to continue/be allowed to live.  
What is your definition of normal?  Your current normal seems pretty rough.  Doing anything to alleviate your current normal seems better than worrying about getting to some dreamy normalacy.

I think we sometimes worry soooooo much about doing what everyone else is doing.  I would say to live each day at a time.   If you need to break it down further then figure out what you want to do for the next hour.  Don't worry about the rest of your life if your having such a tough time getting through today.

Forget about being normal for today.  I've been more or less living totally off of hot cocoa today (I think I've had probably 10 cups) but I've been messing around making it different each time.  I guess my goal is trying to make the perfect cup of hot chocolate for today.  Whether it continues for tomorrow who knows?

Skip rocks for a day, Walk around a nature park for a day, listen to all the classical music artists (Handel, Beethoven, Mozart, etc.)

The world is full of possibilities and many "normal" people barely scratch the surface of doing anything because they just do everything all the other normal people do.

If you want to feel normal depression, anxiety, etc has become lot more normal than you might think it is.

The numbers for depression worldwide:

"Kristina Hannon, vice president of behavioral health for Family Guidance Center, said that math comes out to roughly 1 out of 4 people worldwide."

"It's actually increased 18 percent in a 10-year period, so from 2000 to 2010 the World Health Organization has determined that there's actually an 18.4 percent increase in depression worldwide,” she said."

I've dealt with depression for...probably 15 - 20 years.  I didn't really recognize it till I was pretty much knee deep in it and even after that I didn't necessarily do too much to work to fix it.  It's still a problem for me but each day the world changes.  Who knows what tomorrow might bring?

What in the past took years to bring to fruition happens much more rapidly in todays world.  What you thought not possibly this week could be probable next week.

All I can do is tell you to keeping trying.  Don't give up!  Keep a journal of how your feeling.  Write down your problems!  I have learned that mental problems like math problems are much more easily recognizable when written down than bottle up in your brain.  I personally send an email to myself but pen and paper work great as well.

Thanks for sharing that. I must stress that you have to find one thing you love. Create a blog, sub, etc. 
> My life might be shit but fuck it if she can't have a great lil cat life.

I like you. Your cat's lucky to have you.
I screwed up. I screwed up so immensely that I won't be able to keep it a secret from my parents for long. I'm in such a mess that it will take several years at least, if nothing else goes wrong, just to get my life back on track. 

I failed several university classes (I'm in my third year), to the point that I need to (at least temporarily) withdraw from my program, and am essentially suspended from university for a year (it's a mandatory policy so that students that are failing have time to fix whatever is their problem before trying again and still failing). 

My parents love me, but they scold me for even minor things to the point that I feel like I am living in hell even when nothing is wrong. I once literally cut open my wrist with a knife in the middle of an argument with them over a C in one of my grade 9 classes (I was pretty much at least a B+ student, usually much better than that in every subject), because in that moment, I'd sooner be dead, or in an ambluence, or anywhere else, so long as it was not there, having that discussion with them.

They already know that I failed these classes, and I even more or less held it together, while telling them. It was worse than awful, but here I am, still alive and typing it out, several weeks later. But they do not yet know that I'll not be going back to uni this September.

Once they find out, I know exactly how it will go. My dad, who was himself once a uni prof will rapid fire a long list of suggestions on how to fix it. I'll have to tell him that I looked at every option, already talked to faculty advisers, and I know for certain that there is nothing I can do. He will ignore me, and probably try to do  some research of his own and still obviously turn up with nothing. My mom will just be sitting quietly and crying in the background. Every couple of minutes, they will shout at me about how could I do this to them when they did everything they could to get me to where I am today, ask me if do I even realize how awful things are, and what do we do now? How can I answer these questions? There is nothing that I can say or do that will make it better.

I've endured an enormous amount of pain in my rather short life, but I do not know if I can survive this. Every fiber of my being wants me to kill myself rather than have that talk. And it's not the loud and desperate kind of thoughts, merely hurt and panicking, that I used to have, but rather completely calm and almost rational ones. It no longer feels like it is someone else that is telling me to do it, it feels like I am the one. I don't have anything to live for, I do not have anyone in my life that I'd rather see and talk to instead of being alone, I don't have any activity or hobby that I'd rather be doing than being asleep. The happiest memory I have is when I was getting my wisdom teeth pulled out, they gave me a general anesthetic. I could hear my pulse monitor slowing down, feel myself losing feeling in my limbs, the surgeon counting down from 10, with each second seeming to take longer and longer, and for the first and only time in my life, I felt completely content, completely at peace. This is what I have been imagining every waking moment since I got the news. I have sense enough to realize that it is an illusion, that it is stupid, that I'm only thinking this way because something must be wrong with my head. But I can't control what I want, and I want this more than I have ever wanted anything. I'm an atheist, and yet I find myself saying or thinking "God, just please, let me die." over and over. 

This isn't even really a plea for help or advice. I'm not in a position where you, my dear reader, can help me. I just really wanted to get this off of my chest.
Hey man, I know you think we're not in a position to help, but I've been there. I've even failed out three separate times. It will be ok. I know that it might not feel like that right now, but really it will be ok. 

Does your school have an appeals process? I've never heard of a school not having one of those. If so it would probably be located in the office of the registrars office. You basically meet with someone, talk about what happened, and fill out a one page written statement. If this is your first time, they are *very* likely to let you back in. They were with me. Universities aren't heartless, they know that sometimes things come up with students. 

If you don't have an appeals process, petition to retroactively withdraw from the term. Your school has this process in place. They don't frequently tell students about it and you will probably have to ask the registrars office, but I guarantee 100% it exists. You'll also have to meet with someone and fill out a oneish page statement. Essentially, you're asking to withdraw form any classes you didn't do well in after the term because you had circumstances outside of your control that made withdrawing before the deadline impossible (your circumstances being mental health related). It won't affect your forced year long deferral, but it will massively help your GPA for when you re-enroll and you won't have to pay from the classes you withdraw from.

Even if your school doesn't have an appeals process, take a year of classes at community college! I ended up doing most of my degree there because it turns out that I liked that environment A LOT more and I was doing better academically there.

However, it kinda seems like you might benefit from taking some time off. Have you thought about seeing a therapist? It really seems like that would help. Do you parents know what your going through?

That talk is the worst feeling. I'd usually try to spend weeks trying to avoid it. I'd be dreading it and feel miserable the entire time I was shying away from their questions. I was so sure they would be furious, that they'd disown me, or cut me off, or some other terrible thing. 

But that never happened. It didn't happen the first time. It didn't happen the second time. It didn't even happen the third time when I thought that they must really think I was a fuck up since this kept happening. 

It's not going to happen to you either. They weren't super happy about the school stuff, but their very first concern was making sure I was ok. The school stuff was on the back-burner of their minds.

Be honest with them. Let them know whats really going on. It's going to be ok. I know it doesn't seem like it right now, but trust me, I've been where you are. It's going to be ok.

You're three years in. You are so close to finishing. This little hick-up (and this is only just a little hick-up, you'll get through this) won't matter in the long run. 

If you ever want to talk, feel free to message me. I'm always on this site killing time and I'd be more than willing to talk about stuff or just chit-chat.

Once again, everything is going to be fine.
I've gone through pretty much exactly this - several times in fact. I'm bipolar and after years of struggling in college (literally 7 years of trying to make it work including changing my major and time off and medical leaves) I finally was honest with myself (and then my parents) that I could no longer put forth so much energy into something that was hurting me so much mentally. I dreaded having that conversation with my parents because they paid for my education and watched me struggle over and over to just get my degree (and be "normal" and successful). But I had to take a deep breath (and probably a fair amount of Xanax - don't necessarily follow my example here!) and tell them my fight was over and I had to just accept that I was going to disappoint them. And I did it. And it hurt us all. And I cried a lot. And things were awkward between us for awhile. And we fought a lot. And I felt like a useless piece of shit for awhile.

But they never stopped loving me. 

It's six years later and I found a job I like that has advancement opportunities without a degree! The struggles I faced with school and my parents are a thing of the past and all is forgiven. They're proud of me for being happy and stable. They're proud of who I'm turning out to be instead of the college grad they expected. I'm so freakin happy with my life now :)

You are going to face some hard times ahead, but I promise you, being honest with your parents and looking to them for help is the best thing you can do for yourself, and while you'll have to deal with a lot of crappy feelings for awhile, I promise your future self will be so thankful you powered through it. I swear it gets better. You can do this. 


Wow. Has no one replied to this yet? I am sorry. This sounds just awful. I am probably not going to say anything useful here I just wanted to at least acknowledge your post...and pain. 

All I can offer is an outside perspective in that it seems like your parents and their goals are destroying you. It's like you don't exist as your own self, for yourself or them, just as a character in a story they wrote.  

AS an outsider it seems like you should just run...do anything stay with a friend, check into the hospital, drive someplace warm and sleep out. Just get some barriers and distance between you and your parents. 

Now I suppose you are held to your parents by guilt or loyalty or fear of being on your own...or who knows a million  things I don't know about.

I just hope you will consider that most things that hold people in bad situations are illusions of a sort...powerful I guess, but the type of things that if you are at a point of wanting death over keeping on like you have been, that can be tested and overcome. You can for example not ever talk to your parents again...just walk out the door and do anything but go back. Probably when you think of anything you might do...you at the same moment think of a hundred reasons you couldn't do that. Anyhow sorry you are hurting. I hope you hang in there....i am sure others will post here with more sensible things to say and hopefully help. I the mean time just focus on getting through the next few minutes, then the next few after that. Thongs do get better. I am glad you are reaching out.
Rip the bandage off and tell them. It may help if you tell your mom, separately, first. Just bite the bullet and do it. You have youth on your side to correct all of this. *And don't kill yourself over this, for crying out loud*. 
I can never know how you're feeling, but I just wanted to let you know that I have been in a similar place before. I failed all of my classes after always being an A student, my anxiety and depression flared up in a way I didn't even know it could, my brother was struggling with opioid abuse, I thought I was going to lose my family, and I didn't have any place to live. It took some hard work and some time, but I'm happy now- I'm so, so happy now. Things can get better.
I am sure you'll be bombarded with 'advises'. Why can't you just hold out on those thoughts for some time now? Just to see if things will get better, for it will as you have gone through a lot and you will surely be 'paid' for your troubles in the past. Take care my boy, you're the only person who can save you. 
^ OP, this is really great advice and exactly what I did.

Universities are surprisingly forgiving and they really want a low dropout rate and your money so your student standing will be okay. 
 Absolutely petition to retroactively withdraw from the term if they don't have an appeals process and remember it's gonna be okay.

/r/raisedbynarcississts has been a very supportive subreddit for me and based on what you said you might want to check it out.  I could be totally off base about the narcissism though.  Anyways, I don't have great parents, my mum's a teacher and I was sure that she'd disown me, or cut me off, or some other terrible thing. Just like the other commenter, it never happened. Even the third time I fucked up.  You are in good company. 

The depths of depression and despair are ruthless but in time you will heal. Therapists are really helpful with that stuff too btw. Also, writing or journalling is a really great way of venting and processing feelings.  

Pickup your pencil paintbrush or whatever and mess around. Artistic stuff is really restorative and a healthy way to vent and cope. Times of crisis can yield really powerful art too!
>If you don't have an appeals process, petition to retroactively withdraw from the term. 

This. I've done this twice. Once after a suicide attempt, and again after I spent time in jail. I thought my mom had withdrawn me while I was incarcerated, but then I got a bill a few months later for several thousand dollars from my university. They're much more forgiving than you might expect, and they wrote off that whole semester. With medical issues, they're even more lenient.

And this does sound like a medical issue. You sound like you're in a ton of pain, and I've been there. 

>(it's a mandatory policy so that students that are failing have time to fix whatever is their problem before trying again and still failing).  

After going to the hospital and withdrawing from classes, I finally got the help that I needed. Therapy and medication now has me back in school doing well. I'm set to graduate next year (after 7 years, about fucking time :p). The semesters off really helped me.

Also, your family likely cares more than you think. I felt so alone, and I felt like a huge disappointment and a failure. But after they saw how serious my illness was, they were so supportive. I think they would've been supportive all along if I hadn't hid it.

I wish you all the best OP. You can make it through this.

I like this, but it is still so upsetting that in 2017 we have a horrible stigma surrounding MH.
:)
Every single one of you is worthy of existence. You are allowed to take up space, to have a voice, an opinion. You are worthy of feeling, of pride, and to be a part of something larger than yourself. You are more than your job, you education, your friends and family. You are you- a complex being with thoughts, opinions, feelings, and life experience. Be proud of that. <3
I am and I know this. But sometimes my brain is like yo we're gonna have a shitty day. I do appreciate the sentiment and thankyou so much for saying all of this. :) I will remember this on a bad day. 
Thank you <3
You made my day x
Now I'm just sobbing in my bed. 
Thank you  <3
I've checked myself into a hospital twice, and both times I felt like I was in prison. The surroundings made me even more depressed and I just lied my way out because being there was hell. Not to mention the people there have no interest in helping themselves, so it's not exactly a healthy atmosphere. What do you do when you want to focus on truly helping yourself but need more than just some therapy once or a week? 

I'm also in college, so I don't know what to do even if I wanted to do something like a partial program. I can't afford to do it in the summer or on breaks because I need to work to pay for school. 

Any ideas? My therapist doesn't accept insurance so I can't afford to go to him more than once a month and it just isn't enough. At the same time, I don't want to start over with a new therapist because I really like the one I have now. 
Hospitals suck.  I had a very similar experience.  When I was admitted over 10 years ago.  Now that I work in the field I find that not much has changed.  To be fair, these places have to be as safe as possible which feels super restrictive.

I'm sorry you are having a hard time finding treatment.  It's really hard to find adequate treatment that is affordable and works around an inflexible schedule.  If you're looking for a solution I would ask your preferred treatment professional for a referal to someone who may accept your insurance.  Maybe try self help workbooks or something like that.  There are loads of worksheets and such available on the web.  Also look to your university for mental health resources.  When I was in uni I saw masters students all 4 years for therapy and counseling.

Things may suck now, but it's temporary. 
In dense cities and their surrounding areas, hospitals are often quite nice. I've been in a few here in the NYC area where patients are frequently reprimanded for acting like they're at summer camp, having fun and being comfortable without focusing on treatment -- and these are places where real, concrete treatment takes place, not just babysitting and medicating. But I've also been in and seen hospitals in more rural areas which are indistinguishable from prisons in a lot of ways.

Bear in mind that wherever you are, if it's not a state hospital, it could be worse. Keeping your chin up in order to advocate for yourself and avoid state hospitals will always be worth the work you put into it.
Guess it really depends on the hospital and probably also your location. I have stayed at three different mental hospitals. One of them turned out to be a rather bad experience, however one turned out to be okay. I really hated staying there though, as it made me feel isolated and it just did not feel like a healthy environment for me to recover in.

However, when I sometimes hear about experiences other people had staying at mental hospitals, I think I got rather lucky. It was not all roses, at all, and I disliked quite a lot about them. But if I evaluate my stay, I have to conclude that I was never maltreated and overall I really felt like I was being treated as a human being instead of simply a lunatic.

The infrastructure was not great, as the building of our department was really old. But I stayed in a big room with an okay bed (actually had two, as this was a room for two people back in the days) and two large windows, a little table, chair, sink, and a curtain for privacy in case I would get dressed or something and staff would enter my room. Privacy was pretty good. Was allowed to shower and go to the bathroom on my own. Only had 30 minute check-ups while on suicide watch, but in that case they would just knock on the door while I showered to see whether I would reply. Food was not great, but what can you expect from hospital food? If you were on a diet or a vegetarian or you really dislikes potatoes for example the staff would notice the kitchen and that was taken into account.

Therapy sessions were okay. Kind of a mixed bag. Physical activities, creative therapy, psychological education, group therapy, role playing, cooking, self-care, job coaching, et cetera. Every other week we would be able to talk to the psychiatrist for about an hour and your meds would get evaluated. We also were able to talk to a psychologist once a week and your mentor twice a week, if I recall correctly.

While at other hospitals I did get regular drug tests, I never got them at this particular place. I was allowed to leave the domain at certain hours if I would write down where I was going and how long (insurance and safety issue). Basically we were able to spend a lot of free time during the evening after therapy ended, and I usually bought some groceries or went for a walk during these hours. During the weekends I was allowed to go home.

No possessions of mine ever got taken away from me. Not even sharp objects or anything. I never got searched. My parents or visitors were allowed to bring me basically anything beside drugs or alcohol, obviously. I was allowed to keep my phone, my laptop and even a PlayStation at my room with a monitor. Phone had to be handed in during the night though, to make sure we had a good night’s rest.

Staff was alright. Liked some more than others, of course. But most of them were nice. I was able to get along with one of them really well. We had long discussions about music and TV shows. Staff never got mad at me or anything, not even when I exhibited problematic behaviour. They usually tried to talk to me instead of immediately dragging me to an isolation room or something. But then again, when I am upset or angry I am passively aggressive instead of actively. When I look back at it now, I realise how patient the staff there had been with me at certain points. Most of them were also pretty empathetic and skipping a therapy session for example was allowed if you explained why it was difficult for you to join that time. I remember skipping sports sessions because it was a session with many people and I am scared of bigger groups of people, so then the staff arranged for me to have a gym session on my own instead.

There were two TV sets which we could use if there were no therapy sessions, and we were allowed to smoke until almost midnight. Staff would even occasionally join us and talk to us and kind of chill with us, haha.

Weekly a certain activity would be organised for the patients. These things would vary but I remember going on a biking trip, watching a movie together, going horseback riding, playing board games, baking a cake for the whole group, and stuff like that.

So overall, this was not really a bad experience. While being there I kept thinking: I just want to go home… But I have to admit that I never really got treated badly. It did not feel like a prison at all. Yes, there were many rules which we had to follow, but this is needed to keep things running smoothly and staff was rather flexible and humane. The three mental hospitals I have been to have all been extremely different experiences to me. Different infrastructure, rules, approach, staff, patients, therapy programme, and so on. So it might be worth it to do some research on a couple of mental hospitals in your area or contact them and ask around about these things. Maybe it would be a good solution for you for a certain period.
Inpatient psychiatric care is not designed to be comfortable or a long-term solution. It is designed for people who are in an emergency situation, in order simply to get them out of an emergency situation and on to the next, lower level of care.

It is not designed to get you well, per se. It is designed to keep you safe while a plan takes shape to get you well outside of the hospital. As an extremely restrictive care setting, time spent there can and should be limited to the minimum necessary.

And yes, you should expect your belongings and activities to be heavily restricted. This is necessary for your safety and staff's safety. Because, again, the primary purpose of this setting is maintaining safety.

But honestly, it sucks that you're having a hard time finding the right level of care. Insurance and payment can be a huge, stupid obstacle to finding a good middleground between very occasional therapy and full-blown hospitalization, and this is a huge hole that needs to be addressed :(
I spent most of my adolescence years in and out of mental hospitals for my depression and anxiety. Hospitals are never 5 star stays and some are far worse than others. It sucks because one hospital may have a safe clean environment but horrible therapy and vice versa. Mental hospitals tend to always be depressing because well, the majority there are depressed. Once I was sent to long term and later a group home, it truly helped. I know you don't want that because of money and school. People tend to say adult mental wards are far worse than adolescence, I can't comment on that because I'm not experienced in the adult unit. 

I've been debating whether or not I need to be hospitalized again or if I need to get into a trauma recovery program since therapy once a week hasn't been helping. Something you could do to help at least a little is meditation, maybe even some yoga. Those both, especially meditating have helped me a lot with when I need to focus on myself and listening to what my body is telling me. Does your college campus have any yoga or meditation classes? You can always just do it in your room/dorm with YouTube videos and such. Or just meditate without any instructor (I prefer that because I lose focus with an instructor). 

I know you really like your therapist but you should be seeing one more frequently since you're expressing discomfort. Your mental health is more important than an education. My guidance counselor told me that during my high school years when I was at my worst and it's so true. If you need to take a break from college and go home to fix your mental health, I think it would be best. Once you are back on your feet, go back to college or if you feel like it's not benefiting you then don't. You gotta do what's right for you and your health. So if that means getting a new therapist that accepts insurance then so be it. Or if that means taking a break from college that's fine too. Try doing the meditating if it sounds interesting and whatever everyone else has recommended before switching therapists and taking a break. I wish you the best of luck on your journey, take care. 
Some criminals are actually disuaded from pleading insanity because the mental hospitals may keep them inside indefinitely while they know they can get a set maximum of time behind an actual prison.

Being violent in a mental hospital will keep you there for as long as the doctors want. 
At least in Germany, the hospital itself is okay. If they suspect you're taking drugs or are an alcoholic, then you can be locked in a secure ward, but everyone else can go do what they want most of the time. Going back makes you feel worse than when you were there, I think. 
The lower end ones, yeah.

The higher end ones are more like spas or rural retreats. Which is honestly what I wish they still did, back in the 1800's they would just bring people to the countryside. I want to pick up camping or hiking to somewhat replicate that rural calmness.
I wish I could go back to the hospital I went to. It was the most relaxing time I had had in a long time. I was able to fix myself mentally much quicker as well. I sometimes miss it. But I know I am not like everyone else.
I've only been to one for suicidal tendencies, but yes, it very much felt like what I assume a prison would closely resemble. 
Find a therapist who accepts insurance, first of all. There are tons of them. I also just discovered the app Sibly. Way more helpful and affordable than I ever could have imagined. It's cheaper weekly than my copays for my therapist and I can chat with trained counselors any time 24/7, up to 2 hours a day, and it's anonymous. 
Hospitals are for emergency situations, whats much more helpful to many people are Intensive Outpatient Programs/Partial Hospital. They're a 5hr/day, 5 day a week group therapy and coping skills class.
Semantics/words being what they are: yes and no.

[Per the definitions](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/prison), #3 fits well but when most people say prison, they associate it with #1 which is has an extremely negative connotation hence you'll get people who will become apologists/sensitive if you call psychiatric/mental hospitals prisons. 



&nbsp;

Depending on how the experience was, the patient may use definition #1 exclusively.

I had both a good and bad experience in these hospitals. Initially it was bad because I [perhaps people in general] tend to remember the negatives more than the positives (and/or the positives where meek compared to the negatives). 

Speaking as impartially as I can, most of the staff there (nurses, social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, etc) are generally well enough. I’m speaking from a first world country (US) that has a history of an established mental health system. I know a first world country like China is still new at this so my evaluation may not be valid there.  


&nbsp;

You should only go to these hospitals if you feel you are in danger. These places are meant to keep you safe, not sane (seems counterproductive; doing both is definitely possible but like most things it comes down to money: short/undertrained staff and few resources. They focus on a utilitarian approach of helping instead of something comprehensive).  These places are an absolute last resort hence the other patients you meet there more likely than not will color the experience there black. 

If you need more than just some therapy once or so a week then your only other choice is to find a peer support group that you find suitable. I say only because your current support system of friends I’m guessing is either inadequate or near nonexistent. 

Most people who find one they like (one that is both competent in structure/help and that has people you are absolutely comfortable with) get a tremendous help out of participating in them. 

These are provided by some non-profit organization (like NAMI) or a hospital. Like it was mentioned, a university may have it too. This requires effort/research on your part to find what is available. 

Good luck.

> hospitals are often quite nice

That a matter of perspective, to many people no matter how "nice" the prison/"hospital" is, it's still violent torture.
> No possessions of mine ever got taken away from me. Not even sharp objects or anything. I never got searched.

What hospital was this??  Were you housed with patients who were suicidal or prone to self harm?  Mine they wanded us down and made us take our earrings out.
To be clear, I'm referring to amenities, specifically. I'm aware that most people would rather be out than in. (I'm not among them.) But I'm talking about places with objectively nicer settings than many people's homes.

Obviously it's a matter of insurance, but when I was in places like I'm describing, my insurance wasn't that great, and many patients came from poverty. It seemed like anything above no insurance and state insurance/medicaid would cover these hospitalizations. But they did also all have separate sections with further amenities, for celebrities and more wealthy patients.
I stayed at a mental hospital in Belgium, specifically at a department for people with autism. I did have a history of suicidal behaviour, including one suicide attempt and self-harm. I was housed with patients who all had autism, but most of them also a lot of other issues (depression, suicidal behaviour or tendencies, self-harm, personality disorders, anxiety and so on). I was allowed to keep all my clothes, piercings, belt, laces, jewellery, basically anything. I think it even was illegal for staff to just search people or their rooms and possessions as it needed an official approval from a certified psychiatrist to perform these actions. Self-harm was common in some patients I stayed with, but patients never got punished if they did. I remember cutting myself one night and the nurse from the night shift even drove me to the nearby hospital in her own car because there was no doctor available at the mental hospital itself during that night. I think it is pretty pointless to take objects and such away from people. If people truly want to harm themselves that badly, they will find a way no matter what. If the staff ends up controlling your life and stops respecting your privacy then there is no use to stay in such a place, it would probably make the patient feel even more horrible, isolated, alone, and it might even cause the patient to do the exact opposite. The only thing the staff did ask me was to wear long sleeves in case I cut up my wrists really badly or anything like that, because that could be a trigger for other patients, which I understand.
> I'm referring to amenities, 

I'm saying that's 100% irrelevant to people who consider the rape-like violence/kidnapping to be torture.  And they probably consider the assumptions of guilt to be torture, and the lack of due process too.

To look at one of the cruelest systems ever made, where people are pleading they're innocent and begging for mercy (and being ignored and assumed to be subhuman) and then say "but the beds are so soft" is about as irrelevant as anything can be.
So Belgium gets it right.
Ahh, my hospital was for people in the throes of suicidal ideation or immediately after a suicide attempt...  15 minute patrols to make sure you were breathing, 24/7, etc.

And it was good they had all those safety procedures in place.  Straight up, I was working on how to hang myself in the hospital, and I could have done it too.  Even though they made it *really* hard to do.

Maybe there are different types of mental health hospitals.
I'm sorry but I'm not that familiar with hospitals that take involuntary submissions, and so that structure you'd name "kidnapping" is definitely not overlapping with these institutions I'm describing.

People don't enjoy not having access to things like alcohol, cigarettes, the internet, and their mother's cooking, in the places I'm describing. They're hallucinating -- sometimes around the clock -- and they're hurting and they need help... just as much as in any institution. But restraints barely ever get used, and no one is being punished.

And, at this point, I'd like to point out that what I'm saying is that there are different types of hospitals, in response to OP's question. State hospitals exist, and negligent hospitals exist. I recommend that anyone with adequate foresight do research into what's available in their area, in order to advocate for themselves when the time comes. If anyone anticipates being non-lucid or non-verbal, get help now: ask an adult you trust to keep track of what your insurance covers and what you prefer.
I am sure there probably will also be horrible mental hospitals over here, guess I just got lucky with this one. I had a rather bad experience staying at the psychiatric department of a local "regular" hospital, but I only stayed there for a short amount of time. Currently I still visit a mental hospital, but I am not staying residentially anymore. I just go there for therapy during the day (and counselling, psychiatrist visits et cetera). Sometimes I really get annoyed by how chaotic they seem and all the subpar communication happening, but then again I have little to complain as I am getting proper treatment including medication and one hot meal for less than one euro per day. And most of the staff is really nice, they joke around a lot (to make the situation seem less depressive, I guess, haha), are willing to talk if they find the time and play board games with the patients. I have seen much more dramatic and shocking events at this hospital though, but that has pretty much nothing to do with the hospital or its staff itself. Just depends on the patients. I do not know whether a day therapy programme is an option where you live though and whether it would suit your needs. And I have no clue about the health care systems of different countries and such, so maybe this would also turn out too expensive as well. I really cannot believe it every time I hear someone on here saying they cannot afford to pay for therapy or counselling or other things concerning mental health. As if having mental problems is not a serious thing. Pretty disgusting, in my opinion. I hope you can find a suitable solution. Be sure to get  well-informed before you make any decision. If I remember correctly I was always offered a little tour around the hospital before I got admitted, which also helped me a little.
Yeah, there are usually different segments within a mental hospital. Most of them have a crisis unit which will be much more strict and they will check up on you every 15 or 30 minutes or so, or put you in a room with a camera to keep tabs on you. But if you then enter an actual treatment therapy programme after you stabilized this normally should not have to be the case.
> that take involuntary submissions, and so that structure you'd name "kidnapping"

It's common for the profiteers to pretend their "patients" are there voluntarily, but it's not true.  If they were there voluntarily then there would be no need for violence.  Those people are often tricked and misled.

ie *all* "mental hospital" prisons take involuntary prisoners, after all they're violent prisons. 

eg, people are told they should "talk with a psychiatrist."  Sometimes (eg) a homeless person might be told they should just talk with someone about government services (without any mention of any "hospital" or "psychiatrist.")  Next the psychiatrists order them (via police/gunman kidnapping) into the "hospital."

And what do they call that?  "Voluntary."  Because the victim, while not agreeing to any violence/torture, signed some vague consent form about "talking with" a psychiatrist.  That is not actually voluntary, it's just a way these torturers make money.
I'm in the U.S. I don't plan on going to a hospital. I just started attending a peer-run group that's twice a week. We'll see how this pans out.

My issues are awful, and time consuming, but are in no way a threat to my safety nor to my life. 
lol

thats stupid

I know it sounds dumb but I often wish I could just get wheeled into a hospital and dealt with 24/7 until I'm "fixed". I'm undergoing other treatments for depression right now but they all seem so slow or inconsistent. It'd be nice to just lie there and let professionals fix my brain once and for all. Unfortunately depression isn't something that can just be operated on to fix (as far as we know) like other health problems can so I guess it wouldn't be that easy. Just a thought, though
If it wouldn't wreck my professional life, and thus my ability to support my family, (sole provider), I'd be all for it.
You want it until you're there. Just trust me!
I think hospitalizations are pretty calming. You can give up on the one thing that you're *always* responsible for, which is yourself
My experience was hell but I dream of going back just to escape the worse hell I live in now. 
I've been deteriorating for years, now.  
Spending most of my time at home thanks to agoraphobia, etc.  
Longing to be institutionalized.
Yes! I was so disappointed they didn't. 
Very much so. My two experiences sucked but I still made the choice to be there is guess. Don't know if you've been, but if you're ever there it's a lot better to go of your own free will.
Hell yes. Recently I've gotten so bad, I think I might need to be thrown in one in the near future.
I'm in this same boat! The only problem is, my mental health is ruining my marriage. Rapidly at that. But I fear that being admitted to a hospital for an extended period of time will jeopardize my job which would most likely put the nail in the coffin for my marriage. Damned if I do damned if I don't 
I think you're overly generalizing.   Doesn't mean the experience would be fun, hospitals are never fun.   The point is to get somewhat better, with a defined treatment plan, and leave more or less physically intact.

You have to be ok with giving up your freedom and autonomy for a while, and you have to want to get better though.
True, thats probably why they seem so appealing right now
Care to elaborate? 
I'm thinking of going stationary, so I can get help. 
Do they beat you with a stick simply because you have the word "involuntary" on your intake?    Or are you referring to folks that go in,  involuntarily, and RESIST TREATMENT.     I think you're mistaking the intake type, with the fairly typical noncooperative patient that is involuntary.  

Granted, I have an atypical situation, but "voluntary" would be an absolute disaster for me after release.  The people around me would eat me alive, wouldn't be enough left for worm chow.    Involuntary though?   Not my fault, yell at the docs if you want, but I'm on their side!  lol.

I never could understand... "go to hospital, spend tons of money, and NOT do what the docs tell you to do."    boggles my mind.
I've never stayed overnight but I've definitely spent a lot of time in hospitals. Never my own choice though
Any way to focus on just the bits that are creating marital disaster? 
I see what you are saying but if you have enough sentanence to post on Reddit you will feel babied in a hospital. Maybe a short stay of a week or two can work out but once you hit 2 months you will be tired of it.
The hospital I was in was just boring. The showers didn't work and everything was bolted down. But I had no cares anymore
At least in my state(PA), it seems like you lose a lot of agency in terms of getting out. You can sign yourself out more easily, 72 hours anytime you want vs 120 max, with possibly for extension.

Also if you ever want to buy a gun you're screwed. 
> 302 involuntarily committed info
The Law states if you need inpatient treatment at a behavioral health Hospital.
You have the right to sign your self in as a Voluntary Commitment (aka “a 201”)The crisis professional must ask you if your willing to sign your self in on a 201 before a 302 is done. A 302 will be Issued  if a person does not sign the 201 papers and is dangerous to themselves or others due to a mental illness.
 
>Mental Health Procedures Act 77 of 1976 and requires all counties to submit to the Pennsylvania State Police the names of all individuals who have been involuntarily committed to inpatient treatment. This Act prohibits anyone committed under Sections 302, 303 or 304 to possess, use, manufacture, control, sell or transfer firearms.You could go to jail if you are have a gun in your  possession. The 302 will also stay on that persons record for the rest of their life unless the person has grounds to have the 302 removed.

I was in the category of being asked both times I believe and signed a 201 so I hope not but probably will have trouble purchasing guns in the future.
We have a couples therapist who knows a lot about my problems but it hasn't seemed to help. At our last meeting with him I asked for a recommendation to a psychiatrist for evaluation and I neglected to follow up (I'd say out of pride and fear mostly. I'm kinda scared to know what's actually wrong with me) but at this point I have done some terrible things to my marriage that seem irreversible and I feel my only option is to get help. 
I certainly get that; and I'd expect that.   I'd be "tired" of it after about a week, unless they let me sleep/stay in bed alot, and then we can talk months.   But I tolerate being tired of things all the time.  As long as the psychiatrist looks like he's interested in playing with my meds, and as long as I'm fed and not rained on while he's doing it; I'm game for whatever crayon drawing contests and paper folding exercises they want me to play to kill the time.    Something useful like a DBT series would be cooler of course, but that might be expecting too much.

The problem for me isn't the hospitalization experience, its the follow on effect it would have on my ability to support my family afterwards; as I'm the only one in my family able to do so; it would be a big problem.

So I basically play this game of seeing how long I can continue as is before I have to call 911 in order to not die.  so far, so good.  lol.

That sounds awful. 
Thanks for the reply though. 
I have thought about that since I do have a couple rifles; but honestly, I haven't even gone to the range or hunting in years; I had been interested in ballistics, hand-loading, accuracy as a physics problem, but it takes a LOT of effort to do well, and physical tremor in my hand screws it up anyway. I barely got to 1 MOA accuracy.   So it basically turned into a hobby that was beyond my ability to succeed at.     My wife has a handgun she likes, but you can imagine how poorly I shoot it; its just plane ole embarrassing.

I guess I'd need to get a safe for her to keep her firearms in that I wouldn't have access to; in order to go that route?
Everything is awful

Hey there! It's incredibly brave of you to tell your story and share it with the world, especially on video, which can be quite scary. I'm glad you have supportive people around you, and that you seem to be doing well!

I can feel your passion for mental health awareness and its de-stigmatization even through my screen, and I wish you and your initiative all the best :)
This is great! You should xpost this to r/bipolar and r/BipolarReddit
Hello! Thank you for your kind words and support. It means a lot to me. It is true, I was very scared, anxious while doing this. So thanks a lot. 
And thank you so much for the best wishes. :)
Thank you so much! I will take your advice and post it to r/bipolar and r/BipolarReddit :)

Wonderful 
[deleted]
This is really good :D
Amazing job, seriously, I love it :)
**Subscribed**
Excellent video! I could relate to a lot of it.
Thank you so much for taking the time to watch it and leave a comment. 
Yes, that is exactly what we meant to convey with the use of color in the film. 

I also feel what you say. I have been in the same situation the same time, and even though I know what I "should" do, I dont do it. If you ever want to talk, hit me up. 

Thank you for watching and for your kind, kind words. 
Wow! Thank you! I did not expect such a positive reaction. If you dont mind, please do tell me what did you like about it?
Thank you for watching and your kind words, Milchel. If you dont mind me asking: what was the part that most talked to you?
I love the cinematography and the whole style of it, I like how the main character is mostly silent because that's how depression can feel, I really like how the triumphant music near the end makes the person watching think she's about to leave the house, but then she just slumps back and shuts the door, the body language and expressions are perfect, I just love it.
The part when she finally gets out of bed. You can see how hard it is for her and I feel the same every morning. My bed feels like the only warm place on earth. Another part I could relate to very well was the last part when she wants to leave the house. Sometimes I want to take a walk and go outside and I'm fighting for hours with myself. I usually lose that battle, though.
Thank you! This makes me genuinely happy. I have received a lot of criticism over it, so it is nice to read that someone actually liked some aspects of it. Thank you again for your kind words. 
You're totally welcome, I hope to see more someday, it looked pretty professional :D

Yes. And not just the children and young people. Teachers and classroom assistants as well.
I think it is really important to teach mental health in schools. It doesn't have to be in detail about every condition, but should definitely include ways to keep "healthy", how to deal with emotional distress, and how to get help if you're unwell. Probably also some advice on what to do if a friend confides in you about something (particularly if it's about them hurting themselves or others). 

I was taught very little of that by my mum growing up - not her fault, she was a single mum to 4 kids, including 1 who had serious medical conditions, learning disabilities and autism, and she worked 30 hours a week, so she really didn't have the time. However, it kind of set me up to fail and now I have several mental health problems. I think if my school had taught us about coping with emotions and stuff, things might be different now.

My high school had a semester-long class for at-risk kids that used a curriculum that taught personal responsibility, social skills, and goal setting.  Because of that class, I decided I was done giving away my power by blaming others.  It has made a huge difference in my life.  I would hope that most parents teach their children those skills but my parents couldn't because they didn't have those skills either.  I'm glad that my school offered the class.
Yep. And logic, morality, ethics, epistemology, critical thinking, basic sociology, problem solving, interpersonal skills and child raising whilst they're at it. #fuckvenndiagrams
Philosophy
Yes The nation we live in might not be the most heathy mentally. And whhy not it would lead to less problems down the road. And if the home life wasn't steady the kid could learn more. It should be a general class for everybody not just at risk kids.

There is actually a very fine film based on her book that has failed to land a distributor.

I'm not sure why, but it's a shame.
I went to a twloha sponsored concert a few years ago it was amazing! 
I only heard of them because I'm a 1-800-SUICIDE / www.Hopeline.com / WWW.IMALIVE.ORG supporter.

I found them from www.postsecret.com. 

Nice seeing a reply and picture I sent by email to Frank hit their Sunday page a couple years ago.

https://youtu.be/yWbf1gpzqqo

Is it this one?
Yes, and I will note that trailer doesn't really do it justice. 
I actually just realized it went straight to DVD, and is now available as a streaming title. Amazon has it, and some other outlets may as well.
Looks very interesting.

Thanks. This is helpful. 

I do plan to take a shower today so I'll give myself a bonus point if I actually get it done. 
Thanks for sharing. Needed a little validation/encouragement today!
hi i love ths
"You're still alive."

As someone who has attempted twice, this really got to me. Maybe I am beating my bipolar depression.
This is a great reminder for me, I've been further into depression than I am right now, but it's funny how blind you get to the little victories. Would you mind if I shared this  on Mental Health Matters?

http://mental-health-matters.com

I'd provide a canonical link back and your bio with links back to your blog of course.
Glad you found it to be helpful. And hey, if it doesn't happen, remember to have compassion for yourself. You are not your depression and it can be a real bitch sometimes.
Thank you for reading! I'm happy you felt encouraged!
:) I'm glad!
You are! Living with a mental illness is incredibly difficult. Every day you survive is a day you beat it. You should be damn proud of that.
I would love that! Thank you!

To be fair, a few of these *are* sound advice for some mental health problems. For example lying in bed generally doesn't help people, and it is beneficial to instead try something else. 
In case anyone is interested here is the site http://www.robot-hugs.com/. Creator of this really has a pretty good grip on the feeling of depression. 
I can't tell you how many times I've heard all of these said to me. Spot-on cartoon.
I've seen this posted a lot lately, but only just now noticed the smile on the bedridden guy's face. Something kind of funny about it.
I wholeheartedly agree. Physical activity has helped me a lot in recovering from depression. but I know how hard it can be to just get out of bed some days.
Unfortunately it turns out false metaphors tend to be false.  Personally, on the topic of mental health I prefer [this picture.](http://blog.fountainofwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Doctor_Comic_Strip_HGV_Future_Fantasy.png)

I wonder who this is about...I bet she feels like shit.

Never seen it before, but the level of intellect is as deep as that well.  (What is the name of the strip, and what is "IWSMT"?)
This made me tear up. I wish helping people were so sweet and simple. Could you share the source?
IWSMT= iwastesomuchtime.com
Showed up on iwastesomuchtime.com one day.  Don't know the original source, but I wish I did.

Ten things that normies tell me that just make me more miserable and suicidal. 
Thank you for reading, I just feel I need someone to listen to me besides her. I can't talk to my friends about stuff like this. I will give a little context first. Anyway here we go-

I'm 23 years old, and I live with just my mom. It used to be me, my sister, my mom, and my dad living together. My dad left when I was 14, and me and my mom got closer. We leaned on each other emotionally very much. My sister was still there, but she was very rebellious, and often times emotionally abusive, so obviously my mom turned to me (and I to her). My sister died from a drug overdose about 4 years ago. She was 18 years old, and it was devastating to both of us (even though I described my sister as abusive, she had a loving side and we always tried to help her turn her life around). And we got even closer, and from then on it's just been me and her. We are about as close as two people could possibly be, and we love each other about as much as two people could possibly love each other. We both feel, at this point, that we are the only ones that have ever understood each other, and the only ones we have ever really connected with.

My concern:

I'm afraid I might be eroticizing maternal love. It's the only love from a woman I've ever really known, and I think my mind is taking the next logical step in love (sex) without me realizing it. I watch pornography on occasion like most other people in the world, but for the past year or so I've noticed that I find myself watching videos of mother and son role-play more and more often. I've always shrugged it off as just a silly fantasy with no basis in reality, but given my home situation, I'm starting to think it's not a coincidence. And I'm having a hard time coming to terms with what this means.

Also, the reason I've decided to post this now is because of a completely unrelated issue and it has kind of scared me into writing this. I'll keep it quick- Since I was little I occasionally had violent thoughts (like anyone else), but they are becoming harder and harder to keep out of my head. I'm basically home alone all day (I'm a self-funding independent filmmaker) and left to my own devices while my mom is at work. And whenever I see a girl walking down the street from my window, I feel like her life is so precious. But another thought always creeps in, and I genuinely want to take her in the house and drain the life out of her eyes (if that sounds oddly specific, it's because that's ALWAYS exactly what the thought and urge is). I am afraid of all of these things that I've written about in this post, and I feel like it's coming to a head all at once. 

I know if I go to therapy they will tell me to put some space between me and my mom, but I really don't want to do that because we need each other so much. It's hard to explain, but if I was away from her I would feel incomplete, like the rest of me was still with her waiting for me to come back and be whole again.

Thanks for listening.

I do urge you to seek help. I understand your concern but a good therapist shouldn't "tell" you to do anything. A good therapist will work with you to help you with the concerns. Homicidal ideations are no joke. I'm not saying hey will get worse or that you will act on it, but it isn't worth your agony or the risk that something happens. 

Your situation is definitely unique but it isn't unheard of and isn't impossible to deal with in a healthy way without leaving your mother alone.
To me, it sounds like you have a codependent relationship with your mom. You mentioned turning to her a lot when things were hard, which is understandable because of all of the trauma you've experienced. A therapist wouldn't tell you to completely abandon her, but would work with you to have a healthier relationship with her.

Homicidal thoughts, even if you don't want to act on them, need to be addressed. It's a really serious thing, and is distressing for you and understandably so. My guess (and it might be a stretch so please tell me if I'm wrong) is that this is linked to the loss of your sister. It's hard losing a sibling. I'm assuming that you are still grieving and that your brain just doesn't know how to process it. You might also have unintentionally replaced the relationship you had with your sister for a closer relationship with your mom if that makes sense. 

Here is a website to find a therapist in your area that would take your insurance: www.psychologytoday.com .You can find therapists that specialize in grief and loss, and codependency. If you feel like that's the sort of counselor you need. I wish you the best. 
Codependency is a classic consequence of having an addict in the family. I don't know if your sister ever was part of a qw step programme - not that it would've stopped her tragic death, but because there are options for you in the fellowship. There's [Al-Anon](http://al-anon.org/?gclid=CjwKEAjw_6XIBRCisIGIrJeQ93oSJAA2cNtMm705YRRdBSUpSpJOZWHv1Jhs7yNBPuTKXrCyLOmxHRoCDYTw_wcB) (technically for relatives/friends of alcoholics, but an addiction is an addiction) and [CoDA](http://coda.org/). I'm sure you'll find many people there who can relate to your story and help you find a healthier way forwards, letting you keep your mother in your life but without being intertwined as you are. And remember, you don't have to be religious to do 12 step programmes.

Beyond those support groups, I would suggest you seek some kind of counsellor, just to talk. I don't know if you have a good family doctor who could refer you to someone best equipped to help you, but otherwise try a few different counsellors/psychologists etc to find someone you can trust and you think listens to you and wants to help.

Best of luck.

This is exactly why you need to go to therapy 

> *drain the life out of her eyes*

Also because of this
Don't work at home. Work in a company. I used to stay home for a year. The result was overthinking, which can be the cause of many mental problems
Has anyone ever suggested that you might have OCD? The thoughts you're talking about sound an awful lot like obsessions- and those do not by any stretch a serial killer make. I wonder if you're processing the loss of your sister by becoming obsessed with the innocence of these girls- the fear is that they will lose it, the compulsion is to take that innocence away so that you have some control over the fear. I'm no psychologist, but I have a lot of experience with OCD since I've had it nearly all my life. Try to remember that your thoughts do not harm anyone unless you act on them, and that you can control your actions.
As for your relationship with your mother, I agree that it sounds very codependent. I would urge you to make more intimate connections with people your own age- nothing romantic necessarily, just close friends at least. It would help you to be less isolated from the world, and give you a wider support system, which it sounds like you need. And I also urge you to get help from a therapist- but from reading this, I think you already know it's needed and are just seeking confirmation.
You're sounding pretty Norman Bates. Which definitely means you need therapy and are in some serious denial.
I do suggest seeking out therapy, it is up to you whether or not to take their advice really. A good therapist won't be forceful or upset with you if you don't make the "right" choices.

The thing about violent thoughts kind of sounds trauma related. Your sister died at a young age and these thoughts are targeted towards young women. This could be an attempt in your own mind to take control back from a situation that was completely out of your control. That is just my thoughts though, I highly recommend seeing a professional since I do not have those credentials.

I saw /u/davedy4 post a thing he wrote while in a mental place, so I thought maybe i should put mine here as well.

(21/3/16)First day They took everything on my person except for my clothes. [i wasnt aloud any shoelaces or hoodie strings. THEY CUT THEM OUT MAKING MY PANTS LOOSE AS FUCK] and ran a budget metal detector over me. i didnt drink or eat anything and they wouldnt let me do aything until i ate "something". and i seriously wasnt eating anything on the first day because i just got moved to a totally new location and i was uncomfortable. anyway they made me drink a thing called a strawberry nutrients suppliment. [tasted like strawberries [which i hate unless its an actual berry, not in milk or anything] and tasted like the smell of rotten eggs and chicken] every little sip i took [like about as much as a fingernail amount of liquid] made me almost throw up.

that night i was introduced to my bed. a mattress about as thick as a pizza box and it had no springs in it. it was a long night needless to say.

(22/3/16)Second day i started talking and getting to know the people. most of them were 14-17 years old. there was an 18 year old girl that got the attention of 3 security guards because she went spastic because she said "im 18 im an adult you cant keep me here!" when actually they could because she was involuntarily put in there by a judge or psychiatrist who thought she was a danger to society. i was a voluntary person [because my parents ticked the wrong box on the form by mistake, which got me a bunch of extra privileges. for some reason the staff didnt give me these privileges all the time [like going on walks around the hospital in the morning, going to the cafe, and requesting to be let out of various classes and activities for a while] 

(23/3/16)Day 3, i was introduced to the school/education system in the ward, i can sum it up for you in 2 words. "Card Games". I am also told i can call my family/friends while im in there, all phone calls [to and from] the ward are recorded, i decide its best i make new friends in hear who i can talk to without being recorded.

(24/3/16)Day 4, i hear rumors and talk around the ward about a secret menu for lunch breakfast and dinner, including chicken nuggets and noodles. [other than that is was vegetables and mash [and a bit of [i think it was meatloaf, it was meat of some sort] if you're lucky] every night.

(25/3/16)Day 5, i am taking a piss, when a nurse walks in on me and calls me out thinking im wanking and alerts the other staff. no one believes me when i tell the truth.

(26/3/16)Day 6, a new staff member appears that ive never seen before, he is african, with a strong accent, when i go for a shower he says he has to watch me to make sure i actually wash myself and not waste water. i make a complaint to the other staff before i go for a shower and they dont see a problem with it, even though no other staff has ever mentioned this "rule" to me, nor enforced it. I have no shower that day.

(27/3/16)Day 7, First week is over, i wonder how long i'll be in here. One of the boys goes out for visitation with his father [who looked like a wife beater]. he comes back 5 hours later limping on 1 foot, he says that he pulled a muscle going down stairs, the staff believe him. 5 minutes later him and his friends go into the courtyard [about a 5x5 meter  area outdoors with walls maybe 6 or 7 meters high, you can see it on google maps.] and he takes off his shoe and stops limping, i stay at the door and watch through the window because i know somethings up. Lo and behold he's got some of the good bush, him and his friends toke it up and i get so fucking jealous. everyone but me was this guys friend so i was the only one indoors. and all the other were outdoors [4 including the guy that smuggled the weed in] and one of the staff notices me looking out into the courtyard and asks why i dont join them. i got really worried and didnt want the nurse to notice the smoking so i just said said "idk, the tv is messing up can you take a look at it?" to distract her, she takes the bait and turns the tv on with the remote, finding out nothing is wrong. i said i was just tired and wasnt thinking straight. then another nurse comes out of the "watchtower" [as we called it, basically an office where the staff had computers and filing cabinets and a staircase to a lower level all behind a thick layer of plastic or glass] and walks outside for some fresh air. RED LIGHTS BLARING IN MY HEAD because i was thinking that if a nurse went out there, caught them, i was the only one inside, i was the snitch, i would be the whistleblower, i didnt want them to think of me as something im not. i went to my room quickly and pulled out a crossword book i bought at the newsagents next to the cafe the day before, to look occupied, too occupied to snitch. i hear the courtyard doors open and i brace for impact from the other people. suddenly a nurse says "why do you have a lighter, and smell like smoke?" suddenly one of the girls break down and runs into her room with the lighter, starts burning her wrists and crying. the other teens and there rooms get a shakedown and the nurses find nothing. they are treated like children and dont get dinner. BOY THAT WAS A LONG DAY

(28/3/16)Day 8, Today we watched the first harry potter movie, the bourne identity and divergent, or insurgent, whatever the first one is called, not much happened today.

(29/3/16)Day 9, i am offered some sort of electroshock therapy, it was something supposedly relaxing that included electricity, but you had to strip down in front of 3 nurses and stay naked on a mattress looking thing for like an hour. i never decided to try it.

(30/3/16)Day 10, It's easter weekend, the nurses have hidden paper baskets of chocolate eggs around the ward, HOW SAD IS IT IN THAT WARD? EVERYBODY SAW THE BASKETS AND NO ONE ATE/TOOK ANY OF THE CHOCOLATE [not even me but still, when do you find a teen/kid who doesnt take free chocolate?]....
 later I find a shiv behind a loose wall panel, i decide i best leave it there and not get into more trouble than i need to. but i do tell the most "Troubled, shall we say?" kid, so i can hopefully see something exciting happen. the shiv had a metal blade, and a plastic i think it was, for a handle held together with the classic all purpose duct tape. real "prison style". At lunch i hear other people [who have been going in and out of this place for the past few years] talking about sarah coming back. they talk of staying in their rooms and treating her like royalty, i am slightly unnerved by the sound of her, and how the other are congregating to treat her as the queen.

(31/3/16)Day 11, it's her, Sarah.... She is very erratic and random with her behavior, rapid mood swings. At lunch she says she likes my hair and wants to pet it sometime, i give her my thanks and tell her she is free to do anytime.

Day 11 NIGHT, i am woken to yelling, banging and screaming, i immediately think someone got the shiv and went skitzo, i sneak out of my room down the hall below the windows of the watchtower, Sarah broke a wooden door off of its hinges, and broke the deadbolt off of it. the door was like an inch and a half wide. it's best not to anger sarah, she runs into the hall and one of the guards charges her and tranquilizes her [shit they can do that!? i dont want to be tranquilized fuck that, i make a b-line back to my room and try to sleep]

(1/4/16)Day 12, i walk past the blue room [a room, nothing but a door and a small window. cement floor, nothing more, nothing less] and see sarah in there, she whispers to me through the door asking me to push button to open the door [for a mental ward i was surprised it wasnt guarded] i told a lie and said that a security guard was down the door and i would come back later to release her. she trusts me. a security guard releases her about 40 minutes later and he has 4 other guards escorting her outside the building. she doesnt return for the rest of the day.

(2/4/16)Day 13, i am made aware she has been transported to The Martyr, from what ive been told its a full on asylum, padded rooms, straight jackets and the sort, apparently for the past year she has never been home, shes been continuously changing between the 2 mental hospitals.

(3/4/16)Day 13, I am in the courtyard and notice a loose wooden board over the window and inquire the nurses about it, apparently a kid a long time ago through a basketball at the window [which led into the hall and into the rest of the hospital which made it an easy escape route], i wouldve loved to try and escape just to feel the rush, the adrenaline of trying to taste freedom, but i already had the privilege of going to the cafe during the day, and walks in the car park in the morning.

(4/4/16)Day 14, i walk to the cafe with a nurse as an escort [that was the catch of being able to go on these walks through the building] SHE WONT LET ME BUY AN ENERGY DRINK NOT EVEN A COFFEE. I settle for an apple juice. when i get back i am surprised to see my parents in the ward talking to a psychiatrist, they have arranged for me to go home so i can go to court for the avo they put on me.

its a 5 and a half hour drive home. i am happy to get my phone back. i see my old preschool teacher at a mcdonalds on the way home, they just came back from the easter show in sydney, they entered a chicken contest thing.
i get home and my dog is ecstatic to see me. i am home. i am free. but i do not forgive my parents for what they've done. I feel like this is only the beginning.


(28/1/17) So that's it. The avo got erased from my record on a good behavior bond back in november, life is still difficult and confusing, but i'm pulling through somehow.

EDIT: While i was there I saw about 20 different people, and like 90% of them were lgbt, which made me really sad.

EDIT 2: After thinking about my stay there and what happened for a few hours last night I do remember, when the seasons change i get bloody noses like every 2 hours, in Autumn and Spring, I was in there mid autumn-ish. The cleaners found blood in the sink and on the floor in my bathroom area that was connected to the room itself via a door. They alerted the staff and i was put under surveillance until i could prove it was a bleeding nose [which wasn't that hard, as i said, very often in autumn, but still annoying nonetheless]. 
This was a fascinating read. I'm sorry you went through this. 
Nice read, last year I stayed in ER  and a mental ward six times... fun. But i mainly cried, slept, read. Not as bad as ypu x 
I haven't been hospitalized but I use the Evernote app daily to vent/rant my frustrations, especially during the current time period of my boyfriend and I taking a break.

I've often thought of putting all my rants together in a post. 
[deleted]
Sheesh, at my facility we at least have the common decency to check with patients *before* cutting strings out of pants or hoodies. Just in case they don't want them permanently damaged and they'd rather we just hang onto them until they're discharged...

In all seriousness, though, this was a good read. Thank you for sharing!
Really good read. Im in the states but I had some similar experiences with my stay in a ward. My roommate was like a regular there so she was queen bee and was really mean.  She wouldn't let me watch anything on the TV so I mainly just slept all day and night. 

They also wouldn't let my parents bring me clothes (not even clean undies!) so I had to stay in My backless hospital gown for three days. They also took my bra because of the underwire (I guess) so I was constantly trying to cover my backside and hide my chest. It was a cold nightmare. 

The mattress was thin and lumpy with stains on it. No blankets. Only a sheet that was attached to the bed (I guess to prevent people from hanging themselves?) 

But I wasn't allowed outside at all. I don't know if it's because I was in there involuntarily or if there wasn't an outside to go to but I missed the sunshine. 

Everyone in there had already given up. It was depressing to see. And the nurses/doctors didn't build them up at all. It was like these people were content to stay there forever. 

0/10 would not return. I still have nightmares about that place. My therapist even says that I probably have some PTSD from my stay there. 
Wow. This is NOT a good experience. I live in the states and while it has admittedly been a long time since I was on an adolescent ward, it wasn't like that at all when I was. Perhaps some of the personalities you described, but certainly not the safety or the staff.

As an adult, that hasn't been my experience either. I have had a couple of tough stays, no question, in terms of facilities and patient populations, but what you are describing is some kind of very sad environment. 

I'm so sorry this happened to you. 

Unfortunately, the celebrity "regular" can be a thing here too, but that goes one of two ways. Either the person is truly tragic and lovely and just doesn't have any coping skills and the staff loves them, or they are a hostile mess and the staff groans when they see their name on the admissions board. It's not very common here for other patients to see other "regulars" because they try to avoid that by admitting people to other area hospitals. It happens though.

The safety things you describe have not been my experience here. Perhaps in longer term facilities people may get to go outside of a fenced in area, but my only experience with going outside while being inpatient is a fenced in courtyard directly attached to the unit I was on accessible via a locked door that staff opened at specific times for us to go outside as a group with staff. The fence was easily 20ft. No one was going on a home visit and no one came on the unit who was a patient without having shoes, clothes, and their person searched (like bend over/squat and cough). 

I've never had them cut things out of my clothes without specifically asking first if I wanted them to. They just inform me that I cannot have it if they do not. Same with shoe laces.

Here, there are always groups on the units that are designed for the functioning level of population the unit is designed for. Most of the time, that means the groups are divided between psychoeducational groups like groups about coping skills and learning about medications and maybe about what a diagnosis means, and art therapy, and then maybe recreation like playing games or playing a wii or something. I was placed on a unit once due to a hospital discharge error (they had to readmit me) and so the only bed left in the hospital was on a unit that was not appropriate. It was a lower functioning unit that was majority people in active psychosis. All of the groups on that unit were art therapy. It was also, frankly, not a good experience for the 3 days I had to be there while they sorted things out. I have a journal from that time that I don't really like to read. It honestly is the closest thing I have to relate to your story.

Anyway, I'm truly horrified that you had this experience. I, like others, for some reason expected Australia to have their crap together when it came to mental illness. At least more so than here. Particularly the Midwest in America. Take care of yourself. 
Maybe it is just me, but that sounds like a horrible experience you went through. I have been in three mental hospitals so far, and I really disliked being there. But hearing this it almost makes me grateful to have stayed there. The place you stayed at comes across as one big mess. How are these measures supposed to help the patients? Is the staff even allowed to do all of this? Do patients have no right where you live? Just sounds crazy, in my opinion. I assume you stayed at a department for children only, so I have no experience regarding that. But even then. Just sounds like one big punishment or an attempt to drive patients completely nuts or something.
Avo?
It was shit I won't disagree, but in a way, i'm kind of glad i got to see what went on inside these places.
I got given an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic [for some reason, back then I was only diagnosed with MDD and GAD.] every morning and night, blood pressure was taken every morning for whatever reason, it was shit care over all, I said "budget metal detector" in my diary because yeah, the security was light, drugs and cigs got in on a regular basis, it was just crazy. It wasn't a very professional place. And yes, i am in NSW, I said [in not much detail] it was a 5 and a half hour drive to the ward [which was in Newcastle, about 1 or 2 hours from sydney]
Yeah, for maybe 2 or 3 months after i got out it wasn't unusual for me to have nightmares about it. Even though I still hate the place and everything, I don't have fears of it anymore I guess you'd say?
I mean there was one 18y/o girl but idk if that would count as also adult, or if maybe she was in there when she turned 18, no idea.
Apprehended Violence Order.

Did they adjust the dosages/type during your time there?
How I'm doing is at the bottom of the post above the edit, but short version, better.

none of that, the best "therapy" you got was a "doctor" asking how your day was or whatever, just making general bloody chit chat.
No
[deleted]
Man, that's awful then.   Hardly any point in going, especially not for that long and that far of a drive.   huge sympathy!    Someone's getting paid for not doing their jobs.
Yeah, there was this girl who wore the same pants every day (but did wash them over nights) but the staff eventually confiscated those pants and told her to wear something else.

She was wearing those pants to hide the heap cuts on her thighs.

This isn't peer-reviewed. The majority of psychopaths included in this are unsuccessful ones that are in prison.

Still, imprisoned psychopaths tend to have lower iq than imprisoned non-psychopaths, according to this article.
Imagine what I could do with with moderate intelligence and without any of that pesky humanity crap to hold me back.
This actually isn't surprising at all.
Work in state hospital for the criminally "insane" for a while. The work in a state penitentiary for a while. Then work in a *federal* pen for awhile. At the end of all that, you will know what's *really* up. 
You sound like Krang.
Actually, what's surprising is that (without any evidence) people believe in "psychopaths."

A "psychopath" accusation isn't just alleging a person is "empathyless"- it's *assuming* that some people are *born* that way.

(Which can not be measured.)

Really, if someone you talk to appears to "lack empathy" (*for you*) that doesn't:

- prove they lack empathy for everyone

- prove they lacked empathy their whole life

- or even prove they lack empathy!

  *Them choosing to dislike you is not their brain failing to be able to feel empathy.*

To make this simple, there is no measurement that shows anyone else was born without empathy, therefore "psychopathy" is a myth.  It's blatantly absurd, like believing in demons or "soul illness."  Or witches.

It's just a weapon.  It's a way the state can hurt and imprison people without any evidence/conviction that they did anything.

Even if an alleged "bad evil person" looks *different* in a brain scan:

- that does not prove they were born that way.

- that does not prove they are that way all the time.  eg if not being abused and oppressed.

And to be very frank, "psychopathy" (accusations that someone is empathyless) is a matter of perspective.

*If you accuse someone of such, they'll likely believe it about you.*

If you accuse someone of being a "psychopath", ironically, you're failing to show empathy by accusing them of such.

Krang wanted to conquer the world with his moderate intelligence?
I think the majority of professionals would disagree with your assessment.  
Or a psychopath is somebody falling on the Antisocial Personality Disorder spectrum. 
According to my sources , he wasn't as smart as ppl said he was. He was like a semi good looking chick hanging out with two horrid looking pigdogs. Average grades in school apparently.
When psychiatrists declared gays were mentally ill, and rationally people disagreed, you could say "I think the majority of professionals would disagree with your assessment."

ie, your logical fallacy isn't evidence that "psychopathy" exists.

> falling on the Antisocial Personality Disorder spectrum. 

Saying there's some behaviors/feelings which you morally dislike, and calling them a "spectrum", is not scientific evidence that "psychopathy" exists.

The idea of "psychopathy" (that society has been tricked into believing) is not just a label for behaviors/feelings.  Society really believe there's some subhuman and evil type of human being. 

They can't accept that all humans have the capacity for doing evil things and atrocities just based on philosophy, so they pretend there's an evil subhuman type of person being born.

[deleted]
Appeal to authority isn't a logical fallacy, it's a valid inductive argument. You're conflating it, as many do, with appeal to false authority, which is in fact a fallacy. See Hurley's *A Concise Introduction to Logic* for a background on this distinction.

Second, an argument of the form: professionals have been wrong in the past, therefore my crackpot theory is not wrong, is most definitely fallacious.  It's true that professionals make false calls, but it's very rarely a random untrained layman who comes to the right conclusion. 

At any rate, I've got no desire to discuss this further so don't waste your breath. Suffice it to say that I'll take the opinions of trained professionals over your fantasy deductions.
Especially for aliens whose sole mission in life is to destroy turtles. 
> Appeal to authority isn't a logical fallacy

You're confused.  Your "argument" was used before- "gays are mentally ill *not* because of evidence/reasoning, but because the quack fake doctors claimed to be authority figures."

/sigh.  

The "appeal to authority" fallacy:

 - "Assertions *aren't* valid based on evidence/reasoning, but are based on who said them."

In reality, the opposite is true:

 - "assertions *are* valid based on evidence/reasoning, not based on who said them."

Here's reality, for example: if a chemist is correct they can back up their assertion with evidence/reasoning & they don't have to rely on the assertion that they're an "authority figure."

And here's a hint: a "trained professional" in government tyranny & pseudo science is not an actual scientific thinker.  

My ex gf was bounced between psychiatrists a lot, some of whom were adamant she had bipolar, some of whom were adamant she had BPD. The result of this was that she's taken this uncertainty as an opportunity to denounce the possibility that she may have either illness and I'm afraid this will be detrimental to her long term happiness.

Dating her was very difficult and I'm the worse off for it. I am however proud of how she's taken ownership of her problems, diagnosis or not, and sometimes can be very frank about her poor behaviour, even as it's happening. I hope she and anyone who's suffering with BPD do find treatment because I've seen first hand how hard of an illness it is to handle on your own.
I'm an RN and I have worked on a child & Adolescent psych inpatient unit, now working with adults with addiction and substance abuse/ mental health issues. All I can say is this video is so helpful! Very informational and very down to earth in a short, but sweet way! True to what the video said, sadly, people don't know what this disorder is. I would see MD's diagnose patients with this disease and parents would become so upset and overwhelmed, but with DBT and other types of therapy, people learn how to manage and regulate their emotions to live a very happy and fulfilling life! It's great to have videos like this one to try to rid the stigma of mental health issues and replace it with education.
Got to the part where they started asking people on the street and cringed out. I suspect my father has BPD and I have fought symptoms of it. I'm just tired of people shoving their causes down others' throats.
The woman that said she's a certified counselor but had no idea about it is frightening, saying it's like multiple personality disorder. That's scary, and as a mental health counselor myself, that really frustrates me. This is one of the reasons I wish we could get insurance companies to shift from the medical model of focusing on diagnosis (for instance my agency has issues with getting paid for certain diagnoses, for example things label unspecified). If we simply responded to what a person described, with someone who struggles with BPD symptoms, it would be obvious to work on emotion regulation. Instead, they are often misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder or some mood issue like anxiety and depression, and fed medications that don't address the psychological aspect of their emotional shifts. The focus on labeling what is going on puts therapists in a box, instead focusing on the actual behavioral and cognitive concerns would be much more pertinent. But, we all need to make a living. 
I have bpd. My last therapist hardly knew what it was or how to treat it. DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) is what's commonly used to treat bpd. She said she knew just enough about DBT to be dangerous. Even though she was joking, it is scary how true that is.
Unfortunately this is the story for many people. Even though it is a very common and severe mental illness, many mental health professionals are reluctant to diagnose it or do not have enough knowledge to diagnose it.  Treatment does work and people do go into recovery.  I hope your ex finds bpd specific treatment and gets better.
Thank you so much for your feedback! It is so great to hear from and see mental health professionals like yourself who know what bpd is, openly talk about it and support its diagnosis.  People are unnecessarily afraid of this diagnosis! Treatment works!  I'm glad you found this video helpful. Please share amongst your colleagues.  We need all the help we can get to spread awareness! 
It is the unfortunate reality we live in right now.  As a sister of someone with bpd this was insanely frustrating. It took 10yrs to get a diagnosis and all the while she suffered so much and made destructive decisions in her life.  Our organization is working on changing this.  The medical community and insurance companies need to wake up.  Slowly but surely together we'll accomplish this.  I'm happy to hear you are a mental health professional that is on our side. Thank you for doing what you do :)
It's unbelievable how this continues to happen.  On top of neglect, some therapists make comments like that which is baffling. Cornell in NY has a great resource center with a database of bpd specific therapists across the country: http://www.nyp.org/bpdresourcecenter.  They'll be helpful in finding another therapist if you are interested.

i live near Chico Ca and there is one specialist here that is so busy trying to get an appointment with him is like getting a lunch date with the president. The next closest is 300 miles away in San Francisco. California is a damn desert. I can only hope you find someone who can help. I never tried to look for that in Redding.
Thank you for sharing. This is such an important topic. People in rural areas do find it hard to access mental health care for many reasons. I didn't realize the extent of this in California, but it makes sense, with it being such a large state. 
Luckily some counties seem to be making steps toward reaching rural people. For anyone in Fresno county, check out this place, Turning Point: http://www.tpocc.org/?page_id=3554 
Take mushrooms 
health care is hard for a 15 year old white girl in California? really?  thats surprising to me.
Do you have Skype?  A reliable Internet connection?  Do you like listening to Australian accents?
Yes. The worst nature of what is happening to me is repetitive mistakes, even dangerous mistakes like not just forgetting my meds for days on end but remembering taking them but I haven't . I can double check til hell freezes over and I see the days pills are gone and now I'm being forced to lose the pill minders or leave the gas on for days after thinking Iv'e turned it off. I was sick for weeks after inhaling propane I thought I turned off for four days.

I am not the op. I am a senior citizen and she is a young life with more value than me. I would like to see her get effective help before me.
I feel like if the world was just a better place, many of my issues would be gone. I don't exactly mean people, more society and the invisible prison that it is. I'm an American, but I don't quite feel free. How can anyone be free if their always struggling?



EDIT: Wow, honestly I thought I'd get a bunch of responses saying why I'm wrong and that I'm just lazy and don't wanna do the work but now I feel like that's only what someone brainwashed by American society would say. Glad to know I'm not the only one that feels like this.


EDIT 2: So if we are not free, how do we become free?
Upvoted.  When you have real life problems the state (which often creates them & enforces oppressive class systems) doesn't want to actually solve those problems.  They want to drug you and indoctrinate you until you shut up.

And they want to blame you, labeling you endlessly.

The whole "freedom" is an illusion in America. 
>How can anyone be free if their always struggling?

Rhetorical, or a genuine question?  

Of course, you are right. One is not really free if always struggling, though arguably it depends on what the emphasis is placed on, as to struggle? (psychological, 'external', relational, social, financial, existential, variations on all of these?). 

You recognise a 'symptom' or problem in your question, but is the solution within or without, or maybe somewhere on a continuum ever-in-movement between sites in both terrain and domains?

I'm not an American, though have spent time visiting and staying there (study) at periods of time. It doesn't look like America is free, from outside of it, nor from the periods of time I have spent there, 'inside' of that society. Perhaps your feeling is a common one among your fellow citizens? 

The Americans I know where I live, ex-pats, convey a perception similar to yours, which in part motivated their leaving. Some have identified retrospectively a strong aspect of their personal discomfort and neuroticism (or worse) was socially located and influenced by those kinds of forces, and they've found more integration and a different kind of calmer, gathered identity moving and living elsewhere. Is that an option feasible to explore?

Perhaps what you are describing can be related to a sense of social disconnect and alienation that was theorised sociologically as [anomie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie) by Emile Durkheim?

Part of this may be down to projection but it is difficult to say. I used to think similarly to you, but once I found some ways into healing and mending deeper discomfort and early trauma, the notion that my own struggles were externally located gave way to a different understanding, the [locus of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) shifted. I still struggle but it is processed and understood differently, and thus the effects are mitigated even though the struggle continues (to exist, to be an adult, to be alive as a human being, is arguably a struggle in and of itself. Perhaps, in this sense, it is inescapable?).
>I'm an American, but I don't quite feel free. How can anyone be free if their always struggling?

We're not free. Most of us are wage slaves or beholden to the capitalist system another way.
Social factors are definitely a relevant component to some (if not many) mental health problems. Mental health problems have a [higher prevalence in less equal countries](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/mental-health) for example.
Yes, absolutely. I can't got a day without hearing about a dozen rapes, child murderers, bombed civilians, people who lost their entire lives to the greed of a company and a legal loophole, terrorism in our own country that the media and government are just sweeping under the rug. The world is an absolutely horrendous place and is a solid 90% of why I'm struggling. As abusive as my family is, most of what I'm angry about is the fact that there are hundreds of millions like me. 

Quite frankly, you *shouldn't* be free. Absolute power doesn't corrupt; humans are *always* corrupt and freedom is simply the opportunity to act on that corruption. No one should have the right to make the wrong decisions. The only freedoms that should be permitted are those that do not affect the lives and safety of others. Which shouldn't be controversial AND YET IT IS. 
Sounds a bit like [Weltschmerz.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltschmerz) You are not alone.
For you op <3

[Hang On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epx2J_UZVf4)
One man's opinion:

Everybody, ill or well, feels like the world makes them unhappy.  The question is, what do you do about it?

Changing how you respond to the world is hard, but changing the world to suit you is impossible.  There will always be external realities that trouble you.  Learning to be less upset about it is a life long journey.
Very genuine. And I definitely understand what you're saying about it being inescapable. It reminded me of something I thought of a long time ago, where it takes work to literally do anything. Like everything's a fight. From fighting gravity in the morning to sit up in bed and stand all day, to fighting that bitch at work who just will not let up. Lol and it's sad to know that you (with an outside perspective) also see this country as a prison. Where are you from if you don't mind me asking?
Exactly. I was too tired at the time to put this into words but I know one of you would. Is there any way out of this? I've been considering trying to get my own land and become completely self-sustaining somehow but guess what? Still gotta work to make the money to do so even if I don't want to.
I heard this described in a similar way in an episode of Rick and Morty the other day.
Looks like I'm moving to Japan.
It ain't too bad. I noticed my perceptions changed when I stopped watching and listening to news.
Yes, but only to a degree.
I'm from New Zealand. So, Western in form, but distinctly different in many ways from the US socially.

I tend to think of modernity in general as a kind of mental-emotional prison, but it has taken a particular expression in the US, unfortunately (there are a great many things about the US I love).
This too for me kind of but the news makes it really obvious how blatantly twisted the world is.

Yeah the reporting system in Facebook is seriously fucked. There were nudes posted on a group and Facebook said they didn't violate community standards. I'm pretty sure no one even looks at the reports.
Yesterday, I reported an extremely graphic and very real image of a murdered person, and they said it didn't violate community standards. 
You can try the Send Feedback function. That eventually gets reviewed by someone.
Before I begin let me just say that I suffer from depression and anxiety. I've had these conditions for about 11 years now, so I'm no stranger to mental illness and suicidal thoughts.

Having said that, I disagree with what this woman is saying. Let's break down the basic message here:

* Comments to "kill yourself" must always be taken at face value (i.e. there's zero chance a dumb sarcastic 13 year old said this - it was clearly a full-grown man with malicious intent)
* A single instance of mean words is the same as harassment (something traditionally meaning habitual)
* Mentally ill people are all delicate flowers who are literally one mean post away from killing themselves (with non-specific anecdotal evidence to back up her case)
* Mentally ill people need people like her because they're unable to hit "report" on their own
* The best thing to do for victims of bullying is to remind them that they're a victim (rather than providing them with the encouragement they need to stand up for themselves)
* Facebook should overstep its bounds and clamp down on free speech to protect the feelings of its users (she even acknowledges that the poster is legally entitled to say this)

This may be an extremely unpopular opinion around here, but I'm of the opinion that the biggest thing we can do to help people suffering from anxiety and depression and other mental illnesses is to EQUIP them to handle situations like this on their own. To stop telling them that they're fragile and incapable and victims and need someone else to protect them. We need to bolster their confidence and stand along side them and show them that they CAN stand up to people like this. Even in spite of FEELING fragile.

Trust me, they get enough "I'm a victim" talk from their own brain. It's not helpful. Ask any psychologist and they'll tell you that perpetually shielding someone from reality isn't a good strategy.

So to this woman I say, stop virtue signalling and actually do the right thing for this "victim". Send him/her a PM, tell them that the "kill yourself" post was hogwash and that whomever sent it has issues of their own and shouldn't be taken seriously. Tell them something you liked about their posts to maybe help their confidence a bit, and then let that be enough. STOP CODDLING. And stop asking faceless corporations to coddle on your behalf.
With 1.65 billion monthly active users, they certainly do not have any human eyes looking at the reports. It's entirely computer based. They'd have to hire a team of thousands of people to go through those manually. 
You have completely missed the point. 
I have no idea how you came to your conclusions in your "breakdown" of my message, but you're totally off base. Actually, I do know- you assumed. As someone once told me, "The most ignorant thing you can do is assume." 

Firstly, like you, I'm no stranger to mental illness either. I've had PTSD for 21 years, severe anxiety for 16 years, depression for 12 years, along with OCD, ADHD, and SPD for as long as I can remember. I've been to every kind of mental health professional, therapy and treatment imaginable. Not only have I struggled with mental illness myself, but I have been in school as a Psychology Major for the last 3 years. With all that being said, I'm very familiar with mental illness, depression, suicide, etc. 

And that is exactly why I made the post. 

I never suggested or implied that mentally ill people are "delicate flowers", that they're incapable of reporting a comment themselves, that we should encourage a victim mentality, or anything that you somehow "got" out of my post. Again, you did a whole lot of assuming. 

Just to clear things up, the man who made the comments WAS a grown man.

My point (that you completely missed) is not that every single time someone says "kill yourself" on Facebook, it should be removed or the user should be banned. My point is that it's disappointing that such a comment was reported, reviewed and did not violate the Facebook guidelines. I full-heartedly believe that telling someone to commit suicide IS bullying and harassment. 

I don't believe people with mental health concerns should be shielded from reality. I certainly haven't been in my journey of mental illness, and I'm glad that I have learned to navigate life because of that. However, it is not our place to determine if a person needs to "learn" to deal with it. Maybe 10 years ago. But cyber bullying and online harassment of this nature is all too common, and sadly, many, many people have taken their own lives because of something just like this. My point is, if Facebook has been made aware of it, and it COULD  push someone to the edge, then why leave it? It's not like some random remark that may or may not be offensive or taken to heart by certain people. Saying "kill yourself" is and obviously meant to cause a person harm- whether self-inflicted physically, or emotionally. If there had never been instances where people actually ended their lives because of comments like this, I would understand. But it happens. And it happens far more than it ever should. Most people won't take it to heart. But some will. If Facebook has the power to remove it, and it could genuinely result in someone taking their own life, then Facebook SHOULD remove it.

Maybe it's the fact that I was bullied- both in person and online- incessantly when I was younger, and had something not changed in my life, I probably would have killed myself as a result. 
Maybe it's the fact that I know people who told a guy to kill himself and he DID. It REALLY HAPPENS. 
If a person commits suicide as a result of a person telling them to- even online- they can get arrested. If they can get arrested if the other person goes through with it, then that sort of comment shouldn't be allowed or tolerated. 

Bottom line: You assumed a TON of stuff that I never said or even remotely implied. 

Who are we- or even Facebook- to decide that such a comment isn't serious, or that the recipient needs to learn to "deal" with it? 

Part of bettering our communities, country, and world is not just looking the other way when someone is being harassed/tormented/bullied, but doing what you can to put an end to it. That's not "coddling"...That's just being a decent human.

 Nothing good comes from a comment like that, so it isn't necessary to let it remain visible. People commit suicide. A lot. Why risk another person doing it when a comment can simply be removed to prevent anyone from seeing it?

And, I'm very happy to report that Facebook actually changed their decision, reviewed the guy's comments again, and did find them inappropriate and considered harassment. So the comments have been removed. :) 
>  I've had PTSD for 21 years, severe anxiety for 16 years, depression for 12 years, along with OCD, ADHD, and SPD for as long as I can remember.

Gotcha. So you're the bigger victim and I must defer to your victimhood. A-ok boss.

> harassed/tormented/bullied

Your vocabulary shows the extent of the problem here. Saying mean things on the internet isn't harassment, tormenting, nor bullying. Especially in a first exchange.

Show me a repeat offender or evidence that this person was specifically targeted for this act (i.e. this was carefully planned and pre-meditated) and I'll change my mind. But I'm not going to give in to the most generous interpretation of those words.

> So the comments have been removed. :)

Well huzzah for justice then. Another person censored, another victim saved.

I hope you're there for the next time they get bullied online. And the next. And the next after that.

> Nothing good comes from a comment like that, so it isn't necessary to let it remain visible.

This is the definition of a thought crime. Whether a comment "does good" has no bearing on whether it's allowed to see the light of day.

> Why risk another person doing it when a comment can simply be removed to prevent anyone from seeing it?

Because we can't live in a bubble and be protected from words we don't like.

> Maybe it's the fact that I was bullied- both in person and online- incessantly when I was younger, and had something not changed in my life, I probably would have killed myself as a result.

The implication here being "because I was bullied I'm irreparably broken and forever a victim" That's a wonderful external locus of control. And if you keep thinking like that, you're going to keep feeling out of control of the circumstances in your life.

Look. I feel for you. At a personal level you have my sympathy. But the mentally ill aren't helped by people who insist that they preserve their maladapted thinking patterns.

The merciful thing to do for people suffering like this is to show compassion and help them to their feet, one day at a time. Not cry with them while they remain on their knees.

> Maybe it's the fact that I know people who told a guy to kill himself and he DID. It REALLY HAPPENS.

Yes bad shit happens in the world. Sometimes people are really that close, and it takes a special kind of asshole to persist like that. I don't deny it.

Do we therefore assume everyone is at that point in their life? Do we therefore surrender our will to the fearful and awesome power of words?

The answer to people like these is to tell people to stop being bystanders. If you see someone relentlessly being a horrid piece of trash to a suicidal person, chase them away! The strong need to protect the weak. Not by censoring their words but by condemning their character.

Fight words with words. Not censorship. Set an example for the person being harassed, show them that they matter and that they have people who will stand beside them and back them up.

**EDIT**

I really think it's crucial to point out that you can't legislate decency. Decency is the sort of thing that emerges from a healthy community, not from a heavy-handed speech filter. So if you want a genuinely good and uplifting experience for the mentally ill, we must have a stronger emphasis on surrounding them with decent and caring people who can **offset** the indecent people in the world, not **silence** them.
1. I wasn't trying to "one up" you on being a victim. You shared your personal experience, I shared mine. I HATE the victim mentality, I do not consider myself a "victim", and it's certainly not something to boast about. So, no. You're completely off base. 
2. You seem like the kind of person that, even when presented with truthful and factual information, you will continue to argue just because you like to be right and you want your opinion to be "correct".  I'm not like that, nor do I feel the need to waste my time trying to argue with someone like that. ESPECIALLY when that person is so condescending. You would get your point across a lot more effectively if you did so without the patronizing tone. 
But thankfully, the beauty of opinions is that you have yours, and I have mine. And we don't have to agree.

People are often surprised when seemingly upbeat actors are actually depressed.   
Here's the thing they don't realize. Alot of people when absolutely depressed, put on a facade and pretend to be upbeat.     
You do that enough times and you get good at it.    
If you're good at something, you might as well get paid for it.   

I had no idea about some of these. That said, I'd change the title to "Actors and Musicians". Churchill for example was an infamous depressive yet I don't see him here. 

Pitt's description stands out to me as not chronic, not that it makes it any less legitimate. 
A number of these don't seem very chronic to me, as /u/Captain_Unremarkable pointed out, but thanks for sharing, nonetheless
Comedians are often the worst sufferers. They get so good at the phenomenon you describe that they become professionals. 

See Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, Jim Jeffries, and so many others. 
I completely understand that. I too tend to use humor to mask my inner turmoil, it just sucks because people get used to you being the funny person and people can't imagine you being depressed. It almost invalidates you're feelings because you get the whole "you can't be depressed you're always so happy and funny." 

I'm no comedian or actress, but in some way I feel like I am. Most days I feel like I'm constantly acting my way through life. Life is a stage sometimes but it's not always fun.

Thanks for posting that, that's fascinating and terrifying! 

Yet, so often, the only time anyone gives a shit is when they perceive someone's life is in jeopardy. People will be all quick to dial 911 if they think someone is suicidal. But when it comes to addressing the problems that are leading to the person having a miserable life and wanting to check-out, then the person is just a whiney brat and needs to buck-up.

So it comes down to society wanting people to continue to live miserable lives so others can feel better about themselves. 
Well, she's absolutely right. Quantity of life is not preferable to quality of life. I would think everyone agrees with her but I know it's not true. I worked in too many nursing homes to think even the majority understand what this woman is saying. Many healthcare workers attempt to extend even the most wretched of lives as if it were a heroic duty to do so. It's really a shame.
I have a hard time with this quote.

I frequently live in a miserable state but often I just soothe myself by saying I could be suicidal again. At least no one else has to be involved if I'm not suicidal. I have social anxiety so maybe that's why.

I understand the quote is trying to say people need to lead happy lives, not just exist for the sake of existing. Sometimes when a person is really depressed/anxious, though, existing is enough for the moment. Intervention may not always help. Sometimes we have to accept anxiety/depression or whatever as just life with mental illness instead of fighting it all the time.
> Quantity of life is not preferable to quality of life.

I really like this turn of phrase; it's definitely going in my repertoire.  Thank you for being wittier than me.
> being wittier

It is very kind of you to say so but if it is at all true, it is only due to having lived a very long time and learning whatever I there was to learn the hard way.

I wonder why society is so afraid of death? People are selfish and want to keep others around for THEMSELVES. "Why suicide when you can still entertain me R.W". Are you serious guys? It does free a person, but it makes other people think that person owed them something. Well guess what, he didn't owe you shit. So you all can go fuck yourself. Death if chosen by one is a salvation. If there was a button to off yourself, half of population would drop dead right this moment. 

Sorry for being rude, but people should stop being selfish.
It's a nice idea, but it also ignores the fact that suicide does INDEED make the problem stop.  If you're willing to give your life to make something go away, suicide will "resolve" almost any problem you could have.  I don't know that refusing to acknowledge that fact helps anybody.  

Giving someone reasonable, manageable alternatives seems much more effective.
You could say it's an escape. My dad doesn't feel anymore suffering, anymore hallucinations, anymore paranoia or "god's wrath" upon him. He is safe from his tortured life. Would I rather he be around? Yes. But I would never resurrect him if I could as that would only be the opposite of setting him free.

Sometimes one can't be selfish. His last phone call to me I had no idea that within hours he would be gone. But I was so aware of his tortured "spirit" that while it hurt a lot to lose him that way, so much so that it impacted me a lot in my life, I also know he was better off. I consider it mercy. He did try a few times to be hospitalized and they denied him. He had no other choice, I'm afraid.
You all do realize they are simply using a quote from a movie is was in, right? That is literally what they were thinking about when they said "Genie, you're free!" 
I would be curious if all this education for psychologists really help them understand depression.  Life sucks and the only way to get out of this life is grab it by the horns and end it.  I see it the same as cancer or any other terminal disease, the person who is depressed shouldn't have to life with it.  Psychologists just sit in a chair and looks down on you, and says I can fix you, look at the letters after my name.  Stupid SPSM CHATS, really what the hell do they do??  It's just a bunch of generally happy people trying to understand why people are generally unhappy....you're not gonna understand.  Someone should be worried about this "8 year old" and her comments about murdering her friends and evil thoughts, etc...

It absolutely does.  You can debate whether it is the *best* option, but it is always *a* solution.  
This is the biggest story centered on depression in some time and I absolutely agree with your statement. 
Ok. So, depression is bad, for most that are actually diagnosed, it's usually even worse. But guys, you lose the fight if you off yourself. You're giving up. I know it's overwhelming, some days I just stay in my bed and think. But the fight isn't over until you hear the bell, not throw in the towel. I saw people saying they wanted to keep people here for their own selfish reasons. But what about the people that want *you* here? Your life is the most precious thing you own, even if it feels like it can't get better, even if your sick, even if you're halfway agoraphobic and can't hang out with your friends. I know it seems like an easy way to end all suffering, but that's your suffering. What about the suffering of your parents, wife/husband, or child. People that live through the storms, people that can whether the overwhelming bad just to see another day, another sunrise, are the strongest people out there. You guys act like you've never seen a good day. Never seen something that mattered. Don't compare yourself to Robin, he was a different person, your struggles are yours and yours alone. Keep the faith guys, live to see something, live to feel something, to know someone, live to fight. Most of all, live for your friends and family if you don't care about yourself. If anyone wants to PM me with their problems, or concerns, or just to chat Please do! Stay strong, not for you, for them.
>If there was a button to off yourself, half of population would drop dead right this moment.

Ha, I've considered this exact scenario many times before.  If that's the case, just imagine what that says about the human condition.  

It's kinda horrifying.
One person's suicide increases the risk of suicide in other family members. And, of people who have had their suicide attempts interrupted, 93% are happy almost immediately that they were stopped.
Yes. People really do deserve realistic, manageable alternatives when they are so depressed they see dying as the only way out.
> I see it the same as cancer or any other terminal disease, the person who is depressed shouldn't have to life with it.

Certainly, it doesn't help the person much to merely be alive and prolong a horrible experience.  

That's why "suicide prevention" is often so short-sighted - no thought seems to be given to what's going to happen to that person after they've been "saved", but let's all feel like we accomplished something.  Go us.
What impact does social media have on suicide prevention?  When I'm depressed getting on fb just makes my depression worse.  I don't want to talk to anyone.  It's nearly impossible to put on a happy face.  Life sucks and the sooner you get out the better off you are.  

Do you sit one on one with your patients?  Are you able to prescribe meds?  So far, over 20 years dr haven't been able to mix up the "right" combo.  
Robin Williams had parkinsons. That wasn't going away. Robin's decision was his ultimate decision and there's nothing left to be said. 

I met with my psychiatrist on Monday and he upped my dose again.  I have an intake with a new therapist next Tuesday.

But I'm so tired of dealing with this.  I feel ground down.
Yeah I'm in the same boat. I've often been pro-medication but after doing everything the way I've supposed to for so long and I'm still not workin out perfectly, I'm in the process of trying to get off my meds. I'm trying to use ketamine every week or two (and then hopefully exercise) to relieve my depression instead of meds. But maybe I'll always do a low Wellbutrin dose. I'm very low energy. Idk.

Edit: I failed 3 out of my 4 classes (at an expensive private college) last term due to being ridiculously apathetic to anything and everything and I blame that on my Lexapro. I fucking loved/still love what I was going to school for, but I couldn't get myself to care. I also blame my doctor who was both a psychiatrist and psychologist to me. I had him for 1.5 years and the first half was helpful, and the second half definitely wasn't. He would simultaneously raise my medication doses while telling me that I was causing my own depression.

Ramble ramble ramble rant rant rant I'm done.
It depends what ails you but cognitive behavioural therapy or some form of therapy along with meds is the best way to overcome illness@!
[deleted]
Just keep trying, as I'm sure you have been already. Medication in an art in itself and can take a little while to get right. Keep holding on :)

Nice gif by the way.
The semester I dropped out of college, I had started a new trial of Lexapro. Never again.
what supplements in particular do you take? I've been on antidepressants for about 14 years, and I'm trying to get off them. 
Literally everything. I'm listening to music right now and I am worried about what the next track will sound like. I have TV shows to watch but I can't bear to watch any of them despite wanting to know what happens next. I have games to play... but that feels more like work than my actual paid job. Dishes to do but the time it takes to load the dishwasher, unload it after... ugh. I would like to do things like read a book, go for a walk, exercise... but it all feels like it's too much.

I spend the majority of my time sitting down and doing absolutely nothing what so ever. Just day dreaming. But I get even more depressed in doing so because I am essentially wasting my time by doing nothing at all.

I have depression and anxiety, and I am yet to find a medication cocktail that actually works. Right now I take Prozac, lyrica and abilify.

Anyone know how it feels to be like this... in this rut, and how to snap out of it?

Thanks
It isn't just you, it's what happens when our lives are constructed around our jobs/careers. every living second outside of work is used to think about/get ready for/ commute to work which leaves no time for actual leisure and culture. eventually our minds become socialized to view everything this way.
You might benefit by first simply forgiving yourself for doing nothing. Maybe that's what you need right now. Look at it as meditation. You seem to be "shoulding" yourself, like trying to guilt and coerce yourself into acting... But you can see that rarely works. Next, you might try writing down a list of things you actually did do on a given day; you may be surprised at how much you actually accomplished. Then, thank yourself for doing these things. I have found that gratitude is more motivating for me than guilt. Let us know how you do. 
Remember finding myself standing in the middle of the grocery store with an empty basket, completely overwhelmed by the thought of having to feed myself and having to plan ahead etc. Was on Effexor at the time. I got myself off and started exercising as routinely as possible. Endorphins are amazing for motivation and general optimism and they last long enough to get you going on what you need to do. Once you've gotten started on what you needed to do you forget about how hard it was to start in the first place. 

If you love and care for your body (and by extension, your mind) then looking after yourself, doing things for yourself feels worth it. 
I think you have energy issues. This translates to poor reasoning about your needs because your mood affects your thoughts. For example, a low energy guy will think it's too much work to fuck his girlfriend. That's generally silly. Generally, there's the neurotypical solution, which is to start finding ways to boost your mood when performing a task. Emotionally focusing on appreciating the completion  while you do the task is good.  The non-neurotypical solution is finding the right meds. 
I'm not on any medication, and I feel the same way. I don't honestly know how people cultivate the motivation (assuming it isn't just chance, which I suspect it is) to work multiple side gigs, hobbies, etc.

When reading about positive psychology, I've read that as much as 50% of our disposition is based on genetics alone ([Source, page 20](https://www.amazon.com/How-Happiness-Approach-Getting-Life-ebook/dp/B0010O927W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1498454822&sr=8-1&keywords=the+how+of+happiness)). It could very well be that the trials and tribulations of modern day society don't jibe well with who we are.

I wish I could offer some decent advice; I can't. I'm just here to say that you're not alone. If there's any silver lining in all of this, it's that I empathize with people much better than I ever have been able to. Perhaps the same is true for you as well.

I hope things get better for you.
I have the same issue. I have MDD (major depressive disorder for those of you who don't know) and OCD along with general anxiety. I used to take ability but not anymore. Trying to find medication sucks and I wish you the best. Sometimes you gotta push yourself though, and yeah I know it's hard. I've been sleeping like 16 hours a day the past few weeks but doing anything that I truly enjoy helps. Little steps are still steps, maybe ask your doctor about new meds if you don't feel that they are effective
hey. i cant even focus on writing this so sorry if this is sloppy or doesnt make much sense. 
i am so suicidal and want to hurt myself. i have been in psych wards a lot and i always come out of there sicker than i was coming in there and i have had TERRIBLE experiences there so going there is NOT an option right now. i have a bit of a complicated situation now with my diagnosises, home, drugs.

I tried to kill myself twice and I can tell you, the pain you feel during agony is much greater than the pain you feel now. 

If that helps..
Thank you for sharing this. 
i have tried to commit suicide multiple times. i havent tried to kill myself now because im afraid of failure. afraid of the pain and consiquences. 
i cant do it unless im 100% sure that it will work. 
but im less in a crisis at the moment. just feeling very very low. 

I get iffy feelings from stuff like this, because it feels like a subtle "don't talk about depression ruining your life". Like if we just changed our mindset, our day wouldn't be so crappy. Like it's a personal fault if we vent about our depression.

I know what it intends to do--be uplifting, remind others with depression that they SHOULD be proud to still be there at the end of the day--but goddamn.

It doesn't help that for a lot of people with depression, they vent when it's the worst thing they've ever felt. For teenagers that tends to be through the worst patch of their first-time depression. I know that if I had seen this when I was 14 in my first depression I would've felt guilty about talking about my feelings.
I'm not sure it does, but there definitely is a huge stigma against people with depression and other psychological issues (Bipolar, in my case), aside from the obvious stigma. I feel like whenever someone affected tries to open up, at least for me, there's always that fear of being labeled an "attention seeker". Of course that is an actual problem, because for some reason people think that having debilitating psychological issues is cool and make it a trend, so you're always gonna have problems with people who are seeking attention for their fake, "trendy" disease. And some people who have real issues are "attention seeking" like that too, just because they don't have anyone to talk to.
It's a slippery slope honestly, talking about it. It's getting better as time goes on, where you may be able to complain about depression ruining your day to a close friend, but I feel like bottling it up is the worst thing you can do (from my experience), but if you just tell someone about your past, you may take on that label (except for when you're with a good therapist).

Does that make sense? I just have so much experience here. I'm 18, and I've been dealing with my bipolar for 7 or 8 years. I realized what it was was when it got really bad, and I've only been medicated for 4 years. I hope it sounds like I know what I'm talking about haha. I try.
I'm diagnosed bipolar. I'm doing better recently. To me, if you feel "some type of way" about this all that implies is that you KNOW there is light at the end of the tunnel, but you can't see it
Lol. With everyone telling me I'm basically a lazy weakling, I can't exactly imagine feeling badass about depression. 
To me it implies that the writer is complacent with surviving it not conquering it.
Bipolar and Borderline Personality Disorder seem to have a shit ton of stigma already within mental health, people with borderline personality disorder are seen as abusive and toxic as hell and you shouldn't be around anyone with it. I've lost quite a few "friends" to it... oh well :3 probably why I've only got three main friends now 
Same. Bipolar I. From my severe ups and downs, I know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but even though I'm heavily medicated, even if I feel great, it crashes a few weeks/months later. I don't find hope in the fact that there's light at the end because I've learned I'll be in the dark again. No escaping long term. That's the thing with bipolar, it typically cycles. Over and over, can't get out.
Sometimes, that's all you can do.
You can conquer situational depression, not clinical depression. 
Damn, hell yeah they do, and yes, even within the mental health community. Sucks. Plus, everyone thinks their friend with mood swings on her period "is bipolar", drives me crazy. Not everyone with mood swings has bipolar disorder, my god. It's not just a mood, it's a total state of mind that changes. I haven't lost friends or anything, because I don't tell anyone shit, but if I did, I know I would get pushed away. Can't deal with that.

It says "deleted" underneath. Sorry, I accidentally posted this twice.
I don't think for me it was mood swings that made people leave me even though it would be a common factor but I think it would have been abandonment issues. 
I have abandonment issues too, I'm sure it annoys my boyfriend. I always have to ask him if we're okay and stuff because it feels like it shouldn't be, because of my issues... ugh
Yeah :$

> As a result of this lack of support, people often turn to their physician, who may have had a class or two and completed one rotation in mental health. Hardly the training that is needed. So, in the end, the individual receives medication, which primarily treats the symptoms, but not the underlying causes.

Or their physicians have read things like this and are aggressively aware of it.  

So someone who's mildly uncomfortable with flying can get a Xanax prescription (with refills?!) no problem, but someone who's honest with their physician and knows what's worked for them in the past to prevent problems in the future will be confronted with the threat of involuntary commitment.

The troll gonnavote isn't necessarily wrong.

I know I need help but I also know I'm not going to get it, and if I try it will threaten my personal agency.

So I've stopped seeking it.
They had to lock my crazy ass up for me to get care
High costs, waitlists years long for free services
Because they aren't seeking it
There are also situations where you know you need that support, but there's too many things it can fuck up for you that you just can't. 
What the heck for? 
Pretty sure that's exactly what I said.
Schizophrenia. Once you know (and can believe) you have it, life gets a lot more bearable.
Ah.. :3 that's good x I hear things like knocking and doors opening and banging but rarely voices.

This is a TED talk about "The Gentle Power of Highly Sensitive People". I know it isn't exactly the same, but I believe you'll like it anyway. https://youtu.be/pi4JOlMSWjo 

Same. I wonder how I'm still alive.
Same here. It's absolutely ridiculous 
I used to have really bad anxiety, especially regarding authority figures. I'd have a panic attack when a police officer turned their lights on even when I knew I wasn't doing anything wrong.

I ended up doing a lot of cognitive behavioral therapy. The basic gist is when you have a very anxious thought, you stop, find the more rational thought, and say or write it. Eventually your brain stops defaulting to anxious thoughts for every situation.

Example: That cop turned his lights on I'm going to jail FOREVER!

"Wait. No. A cop turning his lights doesn't mean he must be after me.  I'm not speeding or committing a crime. So...That cop turned his lights on. I better pay attention so I can move or slow down if needed."

Sounds kinda dumb but it really works! I haven't needed anxiety medicines like Xanax or Ativan in years.
I feel like that sometimes lol. I can assume things aren't going as well as they could be. There are certain days where I'm super anxious...then some days where I rarely experience it (rarely doesn't mean that I don't). Anxiety will probably always be a part of me. It's definitely not the best feeling, but we can get through it. Stay strong. 
At least you have legs. Some people don't even have that.

I feel like greater political focus on the issue is hindered by the very nature of most modern mental health problems as symptoms of some of our most basic socioeconomic structures. To seriously acknowledge the epidemiology of mental health issues would be to acknowledge certain fundamental, intractable problems with the structure of society and modern economies. It's kinda like expecting a government to investigate itself. :(
This shit bothers me so much. I cant even consider meds for my issue due to massive fears over acquiring something like PSSD. I understand its rare but to me the risk is totally not worth it. And there really dont seem to be a good set of medications for anxiety and depression that don't have this stuff.

My doctor is also not able to find a good medicine for me. I am not willing to take anything that has a risk of sexual sides/PSSD. I know theres Wellbutrin but I also have the tinnitus condition and I've heard of tinnitus sufferers also having that aggravated or even triggered by it so thats also a no go unfortunately. 

Then theres Mirtazapine, which I actually tried recently but it knocked me out and made me totally nonfunctional the next day from a powerful sedative antihistamine effect. It was the lowest dose of 15 mg too and I tried for 3 days and those were 3 days where I literally had trouble getting out of bed (which is not one of my usual symptoms). 


Therapy seriously isn't working and I am getting desperate enough to have to consider medication but no way will I swallow a pill that can cause permanent sexual dysfunction, no matter how rare it is. Even if its my anxiety making me blow that up I don't want to take any risks with my body particularly in a domain that is so integral to a healthy life. My problem was drug induced and I am incredibly sensitive to medicines as well also which makes any of the SSRI interventions in particular a far greater risk.

Whats the hold up for the pharma industry in creating meds for mental health which don't come with such nasty side effects?? The SSRIs are old as hell--why hasn't anybody come up with anything and brought it into the market since? It almost seems like SSRIs are the stone age of psychiatry and we are still in it despite all the research? Based on wikipedia it seems most were made in the 90s which is a really really long time ago. 

Does no company understand that a healthy sex life is important to depression/anxiety sufferers? Of all people why give depression/anxiety patients one more thing to be depressed or anxious about aka their sex life
You act like the pharma companies wouldn't jump all over an anti-depressant that also boosted libido for instance.   A patent on such a med would be worth billions; but no one has found one yet.

The side effects are just that, side effects.  They aren't desired by you, and they aren't desired by the producer.
Because it isn't just that kind of side effect. They're really blunt tools and haphazardly prescribed on top of that, and a whole bunch of things are actually thrown out of alignment when taken.
Mirtazapine actually affects sleep more at low doses. It usually also takes 3-7 days to adjust to its effects. (I also recommend taking it 2-3 hours before bed so it has more time to wear off before it is time to get up.)
I am struggling with my sex drive because of all my meds but for me I reallly don't have a choice. My boyfriend doesn't think he turns me on which really hurts. I'm in therapy but don't feel comfortable talking with my psychiatrist about it. Really ducking sucks.
If i had to guess its probably because so many different glands are involved in sex, that with that many its hard for a drug to not have a negative effect on one
Buspar totally reversed my libido and functioning issues. My sex drive was totally back and my boyfriend greatly enjoyed it. It's for anxiety but my doctor recommended it to me for both that and the sexual side effects of other medications.
I'm on other meds but these are the mental health meds I'm on:

\*Lexapro (Escitalopram)

\*Wellbutrin (Bupropion)

\*Tofranil (Imipramine)

\*Seroquel (Quetiapine)

The Lexapro was the one that shut me down.

&nbsp;

I really wish they could do something about these side effects, because my anti-depressants shut off my sex drive completely. I had to try 12 different anti-depressants before I found one that worked, so I won't consider giving it up over sex. I was on the edge of suicide before I got on meds so it is worth it, but it is really hard to have 0 sex drive.

&nbsp;

Like /u/AintGotNoMilk , I hate that my husband feels like this is his fault. It has nothing to do with him, but it's hard to make him understand that when he doesn't feel the way I do. It's a no win situation. I can keep the pills and 0 sex drive or drop the pills and become an emotional disaster/suicidal mess.

&nbsp;

On the pharma side, they see the sex drive side effect as a bonus and not a problem. Boosted sex drive means they can resell it as boner pill. Lack of sex drive means a desperate person is going to buy Viagra or something similar to increase their libido. Others may do therapy or try new meds. All of which big pharma makes money on. There is really no incentive for them to create a better drug. I mean look at cancer treatment - chemo is barbaric. They created the first formula in 1916 and released it to the public in the 50s. They haven't come up with anything better for cancer treatment/prevention/cure since then. There are billions of dollars in treatments that there's no real reason to update, because their main goal is to make sure you don't die to keep spending money.
If you fear meds but are suffering too much consider ECT. I know many people including two doctors who do this because they can't work through the mental fog the meds create.
For several years my libido was basically non-existent because of the medication I was taking at that point. I think back then I initially took a combination of quetiapine and paroxetine. But even while changing meds, the effects did not seem to wear off, or maybe the meds to which I switched just did the exact same. During these years I had different boyfriends and engaged in sexual activity, but I never felt like a pleasure or activity which I enjoyed. I just had sex because I thought that was what the other person wanted, and I did not mind doing it. It is not as if I felt uncomfortable having sex, it was just this kind of a numb feeling, more or less.

Now I have been continuously switching meds, and during the last couple of months or so, I started to notice that these feelings returned, almost completely. Now I do not know which med exactly caused this change, or which switch did, as I have tried up to 20 meds so far and was always put on different meds combined. But I am currently on a combination of valproate + methylphenidate + prothipendyl + mirtazapine (+ ocasionally olanzapine and clotiapine) and I notice little to no sexual side-effects as of now. I have been on this combination of meds for a couple of months now.

I think the biggest problem in the past was the quetiapine, regarding my sex drive, but other meds could have also contributed. I know it is not a fun thing and can cause a lot of trouble regarding relationships and so on. But knowing that I am on a combination of anticonvulsant (mood stabilizer), antipsychotics and an antidepressant and the sexual side-effects went away anyway, might be a good sign, as there will probably also be medication which will not cause these side-effects for you. The road to finding the right one for you might not be an easy one, but for me the risks outweigh all of this trouble once something that properly works for me will be found. For me personally, if the sexual side-effects never went away, I would still be okay with it in some regards. I either had the choice between quitting meds and killing myself, or being able to continue my life be it with these side-effects.
Whoa what is this correlation with Wellbutrin and Tinnitus? I have been on almost every SSRI/SNRI and Wellbutrin. I too won't continue for lack of results and side effects. I have constant fluctuating Tinnitus, part of a condition (Meniere's disease) I'll google it but would like to hear what you know. The timing of my diagnosis correlates when I was going through putting a new drug in my body every few months.  
Actually they didnt jump on it--Look up the story of Gepirone. 

It technically got approved last year in 2016 actually but it was trying to get approval for a while. Some places seem to say that its due to the SSRI market itself actually and it would have been 'threat' to it. Sounds conspiracy theory-ish but I do believe that haha. 

And today I still don't see it available in the market for some reason. Wonder if the company just ran out of $$$ from trying to approve it for so long.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepirone

According to wiki: 

 "In addition to its antidepressant and anxiolytic properties, gepirone has been found to improve symptoms of sexual dysfunction in men and women, similarly to the marketed 5-HT1A receptor agonist flibanserin.[3][4] Moreover, the pro-sexual effects appear to be independent of its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.[3][4]"

Yea seems to be a really big problem. I would talk to your doctor though if you can about it I mean that's what they are there for. 
Nice! Somebody else had mentioned Buspar actually and I didn't even look into it much before but it seems interesting. Are you just on it as a stand alone med now? Did it help with depression as well or just anxiety? 
Totally agreed. The entire system is corrupt as hell. 
I'm basically on the same meds but on anafranil for OCD. I really have to do something about it because it is such a wonderful part of life that I want to share with my boyfriend who I hope to marry one day. 
Definitely not suffering so much as to consider ECT. I think id exhaust all other things before considering that ever like TMS or ketamine therapy at a clinic. I watched a video of someone who did ECT on youtube and while it resolved their depression they did say they had the often reported memory loss side effect. 

That being said, ive been looking into tdCS recently but got scared the first time I tried it seemed like my visual snow got worse. 
http://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/mood-disorders/food-drug-adinistration-depression-antidepressant-gepirone/article/457785/

Key take away... "FDA found that the placebo was marginally more effective than gepirone." 
Because Gepirone failed the placebo test. It was as effective of an antidepressant as water.
Wow congrats and yea who knows. Thats pretty crazy. These things affect a lot more than they are meant to. And its a HUGE problem when you try to get treated for depression/anxiety and cannot bother to risk sexual side effects. I mean the sexual side effects in themselves can cause so much anxiety and stress!!
I use it with Lamotrigine and the occasional Klonopin for my anxiety. My doctor suggested it mostly because of my sexual side effects and said it could have the added benefit of helping my anxiety. I have a friend that's also on Lexapro (which I didn't tolerate very well) and he says it also works for his sexual side effects. 
I believe in Mar '16 FDA reversed its decision though the company doesn't seem to have acted upon that.

But hey its something id gladly try if it were to ever come out.

Fair warning, this wasn't supposed to be presentable.. My handwriting is SO fucked up. I've never been able draw a straight line. It looks like the scrawls of a mentally unstable man, because they are lol. I don't feel comfortable answering questions about my ramblings and I'd really never post something this personal but it has helped me enough that I'd be a real asshole to not share it and potentially help other people. 

Its really simple. You mark the day and the time if you wish and then write down how you are feeling or anything out of the ordinary. Any time you think you're going down, grab your stupid book and write a few things. If nothing bad happens, write a summary at some point before the next day. I've tried electronic journaling and it just doesn't have the same effect. I'm less likely to actually write anything, or read it during a crisis.

Why is this useful? I've found many reasons in such a short time.

It helps you keep track of the effects of your medication. If you are experimenting with dosages or different medications, you cannot keep that well organized in your head. No way. I was on 2.5 antidepressants, Welbutrin, straterra(.5), and viibryd. I dealt with sleep paralysis and hallucinations for 2 months. I'd also wake up for no reason after a very short sleep no matter how tired I was. This lead to massive exhaustion and constant yawning all day every day. Wake up for 3-4 hours, too tired to do more, go back to sleep. Which was a constant PITA because sleep paralysis is very obstructive. And the hallucinations are weird. But I didn't want to fuck up the happy that I managed to get. And I am stupid and won't go back to the doctor to get help with the symptoms. And, its really difficult to track the symptoms if you don't write them down which I hadn't even considered. Because I'm stupid. I'm telling you the day I only took half a viibryd I slept so good with no weird hallucinations. Thats when it clicked that dosages make a big fucking deal. So I thought if half a viibryd is good, no viibryd would be even better! I was right but generally thats a stupid move and it bites me later. I've read such good things about viibryd for some people but for me it was a nightmare. I tried to stop my straterra and welbutrin as well, without any tapering because I got it in my head that they were causing my weird persistent cold. The few days after were pretty bad and because I wrote it down I saw direct cause and effect. Stop medication, feel suicidal. Sounds pretty obvious yeah? But in these very low states, I might have found other reasons to explain it or not bothered explaining it at all.

It helps you look at your freakouts more rationally at a later time. In only 3 days I wrote down 'thoughts gone negative. Ruminating on negative things just to make myself feel bad. Why?' I googled rumination after I wrote that because I wasn't sure why I chose that word and I wasn't entirely positive I knew what it meant. But, I did and it turns out its actually a psychological term that describes exactly what I do to myself. It also comes along with NATS(Negative Automatic Thoughts). Its when something simple happens like.. you're trying to talk to someone and they won't even look up from their phone. Then out of no where you think 'Im a loser' 'I'm gonna die alone'. Rumination is where your brain takes these thoughts, puts them on repeat and walks the fuck off. Just seeings these concepts clearly defined really helped me. The next day, another loop started and I managed to fend it off by remembering that its some stupid automatic process and it can fuck right off. I made a page specifically for my NATs. Its important to right down the specific thoughts that you have over and over. That will trigger you to remember what you've read about them instead of ruminating. I also learned about neuroticism as it was mentioned in the rumination article.

TL;DR Write down your state of wellbeing and anything that stands out each day and you will start to catch the bad stuff as it happens and potentially stop it or learn about it. You'll have a direct record of your state of mind and just writing a paragraph or less will help you remember specific days more easily.
I don't keep journal myself even though i should), but the one  thing i managed to observe is that keeping a journal(or something similar)can find those vicious circles which just makes your life worse. Journal is a good way to break those circles.
I love that you posted this. All the other journal posts I've seen are these beautifully laid out things that I could never do, however mine looks like yours and I find it motivating that not all journals look so neat and orderly.
Ah yes, the bullet journals with a mural on every other page. Cant quite hook it up.
I've tried, but all I get is frustrated and I spend more time thinking about that and getting anxious about being perfect than I do actually writing about me.

Heh. Just took some of that yesterday before a dentist appointment.
Lol, I love it!!

I hate how this is so common in the workplace in Silicon Valley. I just left my job because I did not want to deal with it. Unfortunately, there isn't really anything "the little guy" can do in these situations. Luckily for me, I didn't need the job and will be going back to school full time this coming January, but it seriously makes me sick to think about all the other people who are stuck in a hostile work environment because they have to support themselves. 

I hope this article gets the attention it deserves and creates a much needed conversation on the issue.
Silicon Valley is horrible in some ways. Grown up here most of my life, and there's such a competitive atmosphere even during middle school(And up, of course). Seeing this reminded me of that one suicide trend at that high school in Palo Alto. It's honestly not surprising considering that people are told to be the best at everything, or you're nothing basically. 
Hi there, To start - I'm using a throwaway account through TOR. I don't know if this is against your rules. I'm incredibly sorry if this isn't allowed here, I understand if the mods delete it. I just desperately I want to stop and change. I'm in a really bad place and would appreciate the help, This is literally killing me and I just don't know what to do.

I'm 20 years old and male and I'm not located in the US, when I was about 14, I started watching porn (like any normal teenager I guess) at the same time, I began to question my own sexuality. I went looking for gay porn but was intimidated by the incredibly 'masculine' older guys in the bulk of it.

I just went between watching straight porn and random gay porn for about a year. Then I found a site (a popular 'tube' site) that had a vast amount of 'amateur' material. I began to look for stuff that had people who looked more my age. This is where stuff stayed for like 2 years, fairly normal porn habits for a teenager.

Then, when I was about 17 I continued to look for stuff of 'younger guys' and stumbled across a site that began to have more dubious content on it, nothing illegal - just looked a lot more like what I was into. But, things took a downward spiral when I was about 18 when I went looking for more of that. Not looking for anything in particular I went messing about on TOR. Worst mistake of my life.

I stumbled across a site via some shitty link (thinking it was just a gay porn site) and fuck. Initially it was just teenage stuff, but then I found stuff containing young kids. The first time I watched that I felt so sick afterwards, I hated myself and genuinely considered suicide. I was fucked up. I stopped doing pretty much anything for about 3 weeks, and then for some reason I went back. The orgasm I experienced was like nothing I'd ever had before. For the last two years, I've been watching some of the worst things imaginable. I HATE myself. I know I'll get negative messages etc from here, but honestly I've said worse things than anything on here could say to myself. I look at myself in the mirror and don't recognise the person I've become.

I've always had issues with social anxiety and being comfortable with girls/guys my own age, so I've never even had any relationships or anything. This, my declining health from eating shitty foods and doing no exercise has just made me depressed.

I've always had an interest in fetish porn (voyeur, fake-rape, public etc), and I guess the thrill of it being 'wrong' turned me on more. I definitely do not have an attraction to kids. I fucking don't, I have crushes on guys my own age. It's just normal porn does nothing for me anymore. My entire mind is corrupted with this, I've become desensitized to everything and I guess my outlook on everything is just bleak.

I don't even know if I'm actually gay I thought I was for a long time, but Recently I've found myself getting feelings for girls my age, which makes this whole thing even mroe fucked up.

I've tried stopping so many times. I wish I could just ship off somewhere and cut myself off from the fucking internet so bad. I can't, my current job and situation demand me to have a decent laptop and internet access. I've tried locking my computer with filtering software, but horny me just bypasses that shit.

I can't go to a therapist about this. Where I am they have a strict tell policy, even the vague hint about this would have my name on a list for the police immediately.

Even with the anxiety and depression, I have a kinda normal life. If I didn't have this eating away at my soul everytime I close my eyes, I guess I would probably be happy. I'm not a religious person, but I find myself crying and begging that if a god does exist, why the fuck would I be doing this to myself?

Everytime I hear a knock at the door I'm terrified it'll be the police. I desperately need to stop, and I just needed to tell other humans. Even if it is via an anonymous internet account. I just would appreciate any advise, wisdom or whatever.

I understand that many will hate me and think I'm so far off the reservoir that I'm not worth saving - trust me, I've thought that a lot recently. I guess this is my last shot. I don't know how I can keep doing this really.

I just want to understand why I'm doing this to myself and what's wrong with me. Or at least try to. I know I'm not a pedophile. I dont have an attraction towards kids. I don't see kids when I'm out and think about that. I see a guy or girl my own age and notice them. But when I'm online, it seems like that goes out the window. It's almost like I'm an entirely different person, who's normal sense and rational and moral compass just switches off. 

I cry myself to sleep at night thinking about my future. How can I possibly have a normal life knowing and remembering the things that I've done and seen? It's not right. I'm not right. I just wish I could get a do-over. Have a normal teenage life. It's been so long since I actually had fun and didn't just put on a 'human suit' and pretend to be normal among friends. 

Also, if anyone who ever finds themself in a similar situation (I've read similar reddit threads and blog posts about this before, you'd be surprised by how common it seems to be) please don't. Stop before you seem to have gone too far and things just go dark.

Anyway, thanks guys. Peace. Sorry if this is rambly - I was kinda crying while writing it, a lot of emotions when thinking about stuff.

There is a reason why some things are taboo.   The mere fact of them carries too much psychic charge.   Like a 3rd rail in the mind.   Do not touch.  CP, incest, beastiality, etc. are part of that rail.    That charge is the extra kick of the most intense you've spoken of

Now first do you think that you will seek out and interact sexually with someone <18?    This is where your behaviour while risky now is nothing compared to the harm you can do to others and yourself.  Think long time in prison

Someone under the vaguely arbitrary age of 18 does not have the brain development or maturity to consent.   Any activity acutely HARMS them and makes you a predator.   

What can you do.   Start by admitting to yourself and believing that this is a slippery slope you are on and is bad for those you lust after - even on video. 

Someone may come upon your post and call you all sorts of names and have nothing but derision for yourself and your plea.    This is nothing compared to what would happen. 

Jumping ahead to convicted child predators.    They have a very low rate of being helped by therapy.   Why?   Because they won't accept that they are hurting their victims be they 8 or 16. 

The picture I am drawing here is Stop Doing It.   Suggest /r/pornfree for getting porn out of your life. 

Consider again talking to a therapist about this.   Just leave to whole TOR and the website out of the Convo.   You have feelings of attractions to younger people but no contact with  CP or children!

Stop watching CP now before you end up caught in sting.   And look again at contacting a pro preferably one that deals with sex issues. 

As for ridding of guilt you need to repent AND back it up with action.   Volunteer w/released predators.  Volunteer in any capacity with children - only if you are clear this is a no sex activity.   Give and volunteer keeping in mind you are repenting.   This works w/or w/out any religious connotation.  It just works to ease guilt. 
I have two requests.

1. Please get help. It's great that you recognize this is risky territory and not exactly where you want to be in your life. The help is for you, so you can feel at ease in your own skin and also to help you erase the risk you fear of posing. Also, to get to the underlying reasons for why this is something you're finding alluring. Your other fantasies seem to be in alignment to a degree: victimization, lack of control, submissiveness. Perhaps this is telling in some way. I don't know, but a therapist, or a sex therapist, could help you find out and find a way to explore those fantasies in a less harmful manner.

2. This request is incredibly important...
Please report the site you found the content on. Admittedly, I only glanced over your post, as it is a difficult subject for me. As someone who was sexually assaulted as a child, though, I feel I must say this: REPORT THE SITE. Hopefully the authorities can find the origin of the videos and put a stop to their creation. Because these videos are REAL. There are real children being forced to do these acts. Please help them escape that hell.
You can still go to a therapist and mention everything except the bit about what you're looking at via TOR. It sounds like you were having issues before that. And since. You seem to have some type of general sexuality issue. As you mentioned you started down this road by trying to find pornography that better reflected your preferences/age. Which seems like something that would be normal. You seem like you know this, and that you're into fetishes, and seemingly why (you like the thrill of it being socially 'wrong'). It sounds more like a sexual version of an "adrenaline junkie." Which has to be fairly common. Like you said, you wandered down this path and don't want to be there. Perhaps you can find some other kink that works for you (and is more acceptable).

I don't have any particular experience in sexuality/gender issues. But, it sounds like you'd have plenty to work through with a therapist without mentioning the CP. And, hopefully, whatever you learn during that you can apply to the parts you're not talking about.
I fully understand what goes through your head, as I have been in pretty much the same situation, though I am perhaps ten years down the line.

A lot of what other Redditors write is true. It is important to find an understanding therapist to talk with in order to understand the underlying reasons. Before I did, I considered myself absolutely disgusting and wretched. I am much better now.

It is very likely that your situation is the same as mine, where CP (and/or seeking fringe porn) is a way to fell the thrill. Our bodies tend to confuse arousal sources and CP is a very strong stimulation. It is particularly insidious when one gets exposed to it while in their teens - as the initial steps can be felt as innocuous (after all, you are only looking for nearly-your-peers, right?). You won't notice when you get addicted and your sexuality gets pretty much re-wired. 

In my case, it turns out I have been subconsciously self-medicating underlying mental disorder, which now with therapy and medication is pretty much under control.

If you don't mind me asking - which country are you in? I have lived in quite a few countries myself and can relate to many, perhaps sharing my experiences could be helpful to you.

I do understand that speaking/writing about it comes at a significant emotional price, but if you need it, I am more than willing to answer your questions and help as much as I can. 
What I would do if I were you: 
Go to an inpatient rehab for behavioral addictions- think food, gambling, etc. I'd tell them I was addicted to porn, but not specify the type. The reason why I would do this is to get away from any type of porn for however long the program is, and to genuinely seek help from people who have been where you currently are. 

I've been to rehab a few times for drug addiction, and just having that guaranteed time away from drugs is really beneficial. 
Having read your post and the comments and responses, I can confidently say I agree with most of them. Yes, you should get help, if for no other reason than for your own sanity. I also agree that the actual act of watching CP isn't the addiction; there's something about it--the thrill, the taboo nature, the worrying about getting caught, the associated adrenaline rush--something that's making you become addicted to it. Since you've expressed that you have no real-life attraction to minors and would never hurt them (you sounded sincere and my default is to trust in these situations) it sounds like there is a much bigger issue here. This has been echoed in several other posts as well and I just wanna back up everything everyone has already said. 

But there have been a few things I haven't yet heard: first of all, you need to stop beating yourself up for it. Everyone is fucked up in their own way. You have begun the process by acknowledging that you have a problem. Now I, personally, think that you have to look at the rest of your journey to recovery (and it really will be a journey) as one filled with self-care and acceptance. My brain is filled with self-loathing about my looks, about not being good enough, but I have to constantly repeat a mantra to myself: "I am good enough, right now." Just that simple thing can help tremendously. And as has been said (I wanna say it's a Confucius quote) "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." 

Now, this is going to be a difficult journey. The good news is, you understand the issues and seem to be firm in your desire to never hurt children; it's just the thoughts and the addiction that you want under control. You know what? That's the same thing probably most people who are looking for psychiatric help of some kind need: "please help these unwanted thoughts!" "Please help me stop doing these ritualized behaviors!" "Why am I so anxious all the time" etc.. In other words, you are absolutely not alone. This just sounds like one version of a coping mechanism for, perhaps, depression and anxiety. Possibly even mild OCD. (Again, I'm not a doctor, so talk with one first before you take my word as gospel. And just honestly don't take my word as gospel; it's just advice.) 

While I certainly don't have psychological training and am not equipped to handle this in the way you probably need (seriously; find a compassionate, qualified therapiest who really CAN help you) I will tell you this: depression, anxiety, self-hatred, and anything self-destructive is not helping you. Slowly begin to learn to accept yourself the way you are; if I were you, I would say something like "I will not actually hurt children and I'm doing the best I can to even stop viewing situations where they ARE hurt. Today is better than yesterday and I tried my best." Without self care, you'll be stuck in a downward spiral of loathing. 

It can also be tempting to think that the whole world is against you because of the way you feel. I understand the immediate compulsion to feel that way--but there are those of us out there who understand that you're going through a very difficult time. (There's really nothing worse than when you're battling with your own brain; I know this for a fact.) So know that I have sympathy for you, I'll give you a virtual hug if you need it, and I want you to take care of your issues and feel better about yourself. 

Finally, though, I feel I would be remiss in not addressing the sociological implications that this issue brings up. Porn in and of itself, while it definitely has a purpose in our society--often a very fun one, if you know what I'm talkin' bout ;)--has been blamed for so many men's poor education of actual sex; in many states, including my own, it's pretty much the only education they get other than "YOU WILL GET PREGNANT AND DIE IF YOU HAVE SEX." Consequently, men learn more from porn than from actual, real discussions about it and come away with increasingly different expectations about sex.  This can turn into an addiction to porn, since it's all they know (which it sounds like you may have anyway) which can desensitize men for the "real thing." Or women, for that matter. It's a two-way street. 

Basically TL;DR, don't blame yourself, seek help, move forward positively, and let me give you a hug. 

Side note: if you're dealing with major depression and that's your primary concern, maybe see a psychiatrist about that, first. It's hard to work on multiple issues at once. I'm 31 and I can barely deal with back pain and depression, not to menton occasional panic attacks, anxiety, migraines, weight gain, and every day stress. One thing at a time, is what I'm saying. Self care. Self COMPASSION. 
You could always try just imagining scenarios in your mind, rather than searching for CP. I know this makes the orgasm more difficult to achieve, but after a while you get good at it. Nothing wrong with it if it's in your head, right? You can't blame yourself for your fetishes, you can only blame yourself for how you act upon them.
Chances are your trying to satisfy another emotion by watching CP then the act of watching satisfies, nor would the act either. It's why most people will never truly get their fix because it's like eating food when you are thirsty, it has some moisture but not enough to satisfy your need. Stress is  normally a big trigger for such emotions. I would try to identify some of your stress triggers and  explore some of you past as these emotions often stem from some passed unresolved emotion/experience.

Another approach is simply working to try and control your emotions, Tantra might be a good direction considering your problem with controlling those types of emotions. I think I read "the multi-orgasmic man" and yes you really can. But it teaches you to control those energies and in doing so you can prolong them. After a fashion you honestly can feel these things with out any stimuli what so ever. Because really in the end emotions are tools we use to achieve our desired results and if we don't control them, they often control us. One other thing to consider is the bacteria and other organisms in you can influence your thoughts and, so a change in diet or exercise routine may help give you an edge. 
I didn't feel hatred towards you when I read this. I felt sad for you. I know how porn can ruin your life, believe me. I never went down an "extreme" road like some people do, but I can put myself in your position a little bit. You're getting off to the taboo stimulation. Your brain has been totally fucked up by the excitement of porn, not the content. It's a strange and dangerous place to be.

You aren't a bad person. If you were, you would not have immense and painful guilt eating away at you. That guilt is a good thing because it means you know right from wrong. But you have to stop doing this. You have to. The quicker and further you get away from this and leave it behind FOREVER, the better you will become. You can shed your skin and become a new person, but it will take time.

None of this is giving you a free pass to ever continue this. You should feel immense guilt and suffering for what you have done, because it's wrong. And also because that guilt and suffering will cause you to stop doing it.

But you must also realize that you can leave this behind and become human again. If you think you're doomed or tainted forever, you will never be able to move forward and you will keep regressing into this behavior until you are caught or harm yourself out of guilt.
Ok it's obvious you have serious issues, but at least you're looking for help.
What this sounds like is an addiction. It's a horrific one that hurts some of the most helpless people on the planet, but it's an addiction, nonetheless. I mean, it's a series of behaviors that are negatively affecting your life, right? You are compelled to do it even though you hate it, right? It sounds like an addiction. Go talk to a therapist who specializes in DBT and addiction. He or she might be able to help you quit the behaviors that keep you going back and figure out why on Earth you would seek such things. You might have some kind of mental disorder that you need medication for. You don't have to disclose your problem in full to the therapist. You could just say it's a porn addiction. That way, you can still get help.
The problem, though, is that IF you don't get help, the difference with this addiction is that it has serious consequences for other people. If there aren't consumers, there isn't a market. You are directly responsible for these kids being abused, and that is inexusable and simply can't continue. And if you think that you won't end up touching a child someday, you're delusional. That kind of thing only escalates. 
Start by removing TOR from your computer. It just makes it easier for you to find sick shit.
Remember that every time you watch people being hurt, you are allowing it to happen, and you are creating a reason for it to continue. Do something that makes the world a better place. Stand up for the weak and helpless, don't get off on their suffering. I hope to God you get better, FAST. 
If you can't or won't get help, turn yourself in. At least then you won't be hurting others and by turning yourself in, they might give you a good deal, like being in a part of the jail where you are protected from other prisoners. Get help now. Don't wait.
The chances are your name is already on some kind of list. Somebody out there knows exactly who you are and there is a 100% chance you'll get that knock on the door one day. 


You need to seek therapy now. At least if your therapist HAS to report you they can say you've sought the help, you're doing your bit to rehabilitate yourself even if it's a small step, that will work in your favour even if it's only slightly. If you continue to do what you're doing you're just going to make it worse for yourself. But I can guarantee you there's at least one person out there who knows who you are and where you are. Law enforcement is all over this stuff like a ton of bricks, it's one of the few things they have that when they solve it everyone is like "aw yeah the police are so great they've never made a mistake!" so they stick to paedophiles like flies on shit. 


You will be labelled a paedophile by somebody. Sorry, but you watched CP, nobody who finds out is going to go "oh well you're definitely not attracted to kids even though you actively sought out and pleasured yourself to CP". Anybody who knows will label you a paedophile. You need to get a step ahead and seek therapy at the very least. When you get that knock at the door, if you really wanna save yourself from the absolute worst it can get, tell the police everything you know. Sell out every person/website/link you possibly can (as long as they've been involved) and get these scumbags locked up. 

The good thing is you know what you're doing is really wrong. These are real children forced into doing truly horrendous acts. Your real life is watching CP on your computer, knowing it's wrong, but not being able to disengage. Their real life is being horrifically abused to keep viewers (you) happy and their captors rolling in money. You're self-aware. Suck it up, report it all (I'm sure you can do that anonymously), get some help. Good luck!
Go see a therapist. You won't get in trouble. You could even ask to make sure, but you won't. 
Hi there,

Thanks for replying, I appreciate it. I would absolutely never harm anyone under 18. I have no desire to do so, and I'm confident that I would sooner end my own life than put a child through the horrific shit that occurs in those videos.

I really don't feel an attraction to kids in real life. I'm not good at talking to people my own age, but that stems from my social anxiety I think. I would like to have a relationship with someone my own age, and have your typical crushes on both guys and girls I know. I don't have crushes on kids. I don't have any interest in kids in real life.

I guess I could talk generally about porn addiction to a therapist, without breaching the topic of TOR etc, but I don't have the funds available at the minute to pay for one.

Thanks for replying again, will think over what you said.

LOL

"We" already are.  Facebook, Twitter, Reddit ... social media sites in general have longstanding policies of reporting suicidal people to the police.  /r/depression and /r/suicidewatch had a mod a while back who [actively encouraged and endorsed doxxing suicidal people](https://imgur.com/S7AhxUb?r) (note: in the interest of fairness, that's an old screenshot, and not one I originally took).  If you browse /r/suicidewatch with any frequency, you'll see regular calls to brigade suicidal people's posts, which the mods will happily leave standing for hours and hours on end, if they even delete them at all.
As if Facebook hasn't already collected enough data about their users. 

I would like to have some semblance of privacy, despite how 1984-ish our world is turning into. 
Yeah, internet users have definitely banded together to help each other in many situations. Site policies are a step in the right direction, but don't you think automated systems should be in place as well?

Suicide is only one of the issues though a lot of other mental illness such as mania, schizophrenia, etc. can also probably be detected. 
Does it make a difference to you whether it is a person or an algorithm. Do you feel algorithms, or looking at anonymized data is a violation of your privacy?
No difference. I don't feel comfortable with any of the "data" that's collected on such a personal nature. 

Even moreso that it's Facebook. Fucker just hands all our lives over to entities that can use it as a means of tracking, manipulation, personal gain. 

Just no. 

This is wonderful!

I just wish they'd expand mental health access to everyone again. They've been defunding mental health initiatives for years. 

Not meaning to be salty. 
Wish we had this in west palm beach

She is courageous you go girl 😀
Very inspirational. God bless her.
Wow, that's some powerful stuff right there, especially about the neighbors writing the names of loved ones they've lost to suicide.
Who the hell downvoted you? Your comment is nice and it's relevant.

I've seen plenty of statistics about Depression, but 97.5% of people who won't suffer from it is way way way off. The CDC in 2011 (USA) estimates that 26% of American's suffer from depression. The Mental Health Foundation in the UK estimates that 4 - 10% of adults will suffer from depression. In Australia 16% of adults in any one year will suffer from depression. The Mental Health Foundation in NZ estimates that 14.3% of adults in NZ have been diagnosed at some point in their life.  

It's as if the author sees depression as some exclusive club and if people can't understand the club they should just feel sorry for us. Just my opinion.

I've long struggled with how to express my depression - either visually or verbally to those who don't suffer from it. This article comes as close to anything I've yet found. Thank you for sharing.
Those numbers cannot possibly be accurate. Depressed people don't give a flying fuck about participating in polls and most go without diagnosis or treatment.
The numbers are moreso for policy planning, budget allocation, and public awareness. The numbers I've found are mainly for the latter. The likelihood of seeking treatment and/or a diagnosis is heavily dependent on the country, the political climate of the country, the economic climate of the country, the culture of the country, the culture of the individual, and levels of access to healthcare to name a few.
I've been struggling with a self-harm relapse since November and I had been cutting 2x a week until I reduced it. I struggled for 30 minutes to not cut myself during the shower but in the end I came out ok.
Wonderful! I struggle in the bathroom too. Hard, with the mirrors staring at you and razors in their natural habitat. I listen to loud music, to distract myself. I try to not look at mirrors, and I keep the counters empty- nothing but soap. It makes things seem less dense, if that makes sense. Do what you have to for yourself!<3
Glad to hear. Hopefully this will show you that you can be strong and overcome this. Keep it up :)
That's great, and we're all proud of you :) the urge can be huge, I know that feeling, and you're very strong to have overcome that. Keep it up! 
You did it! This made me smile. It's so hard to quit when you have easy access to tools but YOU DID IT. 

Let this victory lead to many more. I wish you so much luck and happiness.
The peace an solitude of a shower can be really dangerous when you're depressed and only have your thoughts with you. I'm glad you had a victory here.
I live when people share stuff like this because I think it really helps those who might be currently struggling. Congrats and thanks. 
Yesterday instead of hurting myself I found a roll of gift wrap and whacked it one my keyboard stand. It felt good to get rid of all the negative energy I had inside. 
That's a good idea. Congrats on no hurting yourself!

How? How does one get to this point? Seriously, how did the months of their relationship lead up to this? Was he talking about how much pain he was in? How did she even get this much power over him? WHY DID SHE DO THIS.

This is fucking abhorrent.

I am a much sadder person now.
I can't even wrap my head around how evil and terrible this girl is. I hope she has what's coming to her, no one should ever 'encourage' suicide, especially in the way she did it. She got into his head and said all the things she knew he wanted to hear, and feels no remorse!? What in the fuck.
Reading their text message conversations is so sad. And it makes me furious.
So she was found guilty, right? I want to know this girl is going to be locked up for a long time for what she did. 
So I don't get why on Earth she would want this. Just so addicted to drama? Some kind of Munchausen syndrome? Did she just want the attention of being the gf of someone who committed suicide? It's just so nuts.
That is so fucked up.
My thoughts exactly. I was prepared to defend her against such a charge, but this was beyond evil.
Very much so, completely agreed. My posts on the subject from another sub:

>That's what I wondered about [her being an accessory]. I may be completely wrong here, but my understanding is suicide is technically illegal. As a self-inflicted homicide, but would she not be an accessory? Telling a man to rob a bank isn't very smart, but telling him when, where, how, suggesting resources, and to not pussy out seems like it would be a wholly different crime. Not saying I think suicide should be a crime (nor that it's prosecuted), but I'm pretty sure it's listed as homicide. Her lies don't really help the non-criminal option either, she was covering her tracks before he was dead.

>*edit: though according to wikipedia I could be wrong on the suicide-homicide aspect, at least in California.

>>Although suicide is not considered to be homicide, anyone that assists an individual in the moment of suicide may be convicted of homicide, as codified, for instance, in California Penal Code Sec. 401.

>I don't know where to draw the line here, but she made the case for her innocence harder to make with examples such as *did you delete my messages, where is your brother* and *i don't have his mothers number officer*.

>The incessant *did you do it yet* doesn't look very nice but in the prior examples she's covering her tracks, indicating she knew what she was doing was wrong at the time. Giving false information to an officer and obstruction of justice are two other/smaller possible crimes that pop into mind. Also seems like the prosecutor would've had a better case if he'd included these (unless the article just failed to mention them). It's almost shows something akin to conspiracy, as if she put more thought into how to get this done (and what to say after) than he did. She thought she had this covered but didn't realize her messages could be retrieved if I understood it correctly.

>There is no case without those messages, and she instructed him to delete them for the sole purpose of it not leading back to her, then misled the investigation to avoid telling on herself.

I really appreciate your well-thought out reply, but I'm still just "jaw on the floor" about this. I guess I really hate believing in the bad in people, but its something you need to do for self-preservation. 


I whole heartedly agree about how online relationships can be incredibly warped. I have had a fair share of my own weird online relationships that have been...well, weird. As well as a host of them that turned out quite alright though. 
The onus though, of course is on her. And I'm still struggling to understand how she could choose the path that she did. I guess I want to know WHY she did it, what was going on with her brain? This is just a level of evil I never hoped anyone was capable of and my head just doesn't want to accept it. 
A few days ago, I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/376k20/leaving_school_early_to_see_a_doctor_counts_as_an/) post about how I left school early to see my therapist and how my absence was marked as unexcused and "personal." After following the people of /r/mentalhealth's suggestions, I asked my therapist for a note to confirm that I had been at our appointment, hoping to clear my absence/truant. Today, I turned the note in to administration and [this](http://i.imgur.com/1d1Jqsu.jpg) is the result.
Good for you for standing up for yourself!
Nice to see a positive outcome!

So glad to hear it! Your post the other day made me angry. The stigma of mental illness is only slowly fading.
Good

I am glad it failed, glad you are here.
it's really brave of you to admit it.:)
what steps are you gonna take to prevent it?(only if it's not too 
personal to ask)
Big smiles.
[deleted]
thank you. As am I :)
I really wanted to die. It either results in help or death. It's an ultimatum and you don't care if death takes you. 

I'm glad I'm alive, but I DID want to end my life. I was very efficient, but someone found me and caught me in time to save me.
Some people don't have a gun or a place high enough to jump from. A lot of times with pills if you don't have the correct amount of the right type your body will just reject it and puke it up, making you sick not killing you. People that cut might not bleed out in time. 
I have had a failed suicide attempt when I tried to jump in from of a semi truck, but someone got me before I got in front of it. 
A lot of time it is a cry for help but there are a few times when it just doesn't work out ( and I'm glad it didn't work and I'm glad your still alive ) 
Thank you for sharing this.  As someone who has brief moments of clarity and reprieve from depression, I can empathize.  It's validating to know that I'm not alone, and equally sad. 
You're not alone. None of us are. <3
I found this quote and I wonder what other people think of it.

A Rwandan talking to a western writer about his experience with western mental health and depression: 

> "We had a lot of trouble with western mental health workers who came here immediately after the genocide and we had to ask some of them to leave. They came and their practice did not involve being outside in the sun where you begin to feel better. There was no music or drumming to get your blood flowing again when you're depressed and you're low and you need to have your blood flowing again. There was no sense that everyone had taken the day off so that the entire community could come together to try to lift you up and bring you back to joy. There was no acknowledgement of the depression as something invasive and external that could actually be cast out again. Instead they would take people one at a time into these dingy little rooms and have them sit around for an hour or so and talk about bad things that had happened to them. We had to get them to leave the country."


I've read some studies on the mental health benefit of music, being outside, and social support, so it seems to me that mental health work in the west could benefit from incorporating it into mental health practice more. I'm also sceptical of the notion that depression is something external and can be "cast out" again, but I'm not sure how literally that part was supposed to be taken. Thoughts?

Mental health treatment is still in early stages in the west, so yes, that makes sense.
Good quote. I think it helps a lot of people to externalize the depression and to conceptualize it that way. It's a technique I use in treating depression.

I've been doing a lot of research on the ways different cultures differ in the way they view depression/happiness lately, so this quote strikes a chord for me. I can understand that a Rwandan might not feel that the Western approach to treating depression is the right way to go... culture has a strong effect on mental health and happiness levels and how you perceive your own happiness.

Mental health help in the west is a joke, and I'm actually quite glad someone posted this quote. I have seen numerous documentaries that talk about the "happiest" nations, and those nations participate in what you just described: social support, being outside, community feel, helping each other. The west is a miserable fucking place because we have this sense of hyperindividualism where the depression is not only YOUR own problem, but is a dirty secret. We are not that community oriented, and psychotherapy may have helped for a time when someone needed to be heard, but for some cases of major depression, it's because the person has lost a sense of connection. I like this man. 
Neat. I've long been interested in cross cultural research. It really shows how malleable people can be.

I have never heard someone use it in that context. Either way, "labels" like 'schizophrenic', 'psychopath', and 'bipolar' should be left to professionals for the purpose of guiding treatment.
I enjoyed reading this article, thank you for sharing! I think in general that the language should change. Instead of saying "schizophrenic," I think we should take it a step further and try to say "person (with) (diagnosed with) (who struggles with) schizophrenia." I think it can be easy (and less of a mouthful!) to label someone, but it sends across a message to both them and others that they are their diagnosis.

The best example I can think of is folks diagnosed with personality disorders. "My borderline is really wearing me out." "I have a lot of antisocials on my caseload." As a professional, I've been guilty of that before. We personify these diagnoses and I think it can be a barrier to empathizing with clients and loved ones.
I particularly hate it when people interchange "dissociative identity disorder" and "schizophrenia." It annoys the crap out of me. I'm a supervisor of a mental health program that specializes in psychosis.
So people think schizophrenics just change their mind a lot? The fuck?
In most everyday discourse, it is used to denote being of two minds or having a policy that works in opposing directions. It is, perhaps, closer to the root meaning of the word (schizo = split, phrenic = mind or head). 

The question you ought to be asking, IMO, is whether the term, which basically translates as "split head", ought to be used at all as a medical determination.
it shouldn't, it's an inaccurate historical term that should be changed to reflect a modern understanding of the illness


Edit: please give me advice!

Edit2: I'm not attracted to prepubescent girls in real life. I do get attracted to younger teenage girls in real life tho. But in the sense that if I was younger I'd like to go out with them. I'd never try to actually get with them. 


When I was 3 years old my  neighbor molested me and my brothers and sister. I'm the one that told my parents.. everyone calls me a hero... btw. I have never touched or harmed a child and don't plan on it either. I started watching porn at a younge age. At around 15 I had started watching teenage vids and stuff and i soon began watching younger vids but then stoped suddenly. Because I didn't want to become my molester. I kept it to porn. But recently I stopped watching porn. I'm attracted over 18 girls a lot more then kids but I scare myself. I want nothing more then to be a father and raise some kids and like experience life but I am scared of myself. I don't want to ruin there lives. I sometimes want to kill myself so I will never harm anyone. I want to kill myself today. I feel like if I put a confession in my suicide note people would get over my death faster. I don't think it's fair what my molester did to me and I hate him so much. And that makes me hate myself more too. I want this to go away. I want to be normal. But I don't think I can. I think I need to die. The worst part is my girlfriend 19 I am 20 now. Knows about the porn part and I quit because of her. she always says pediphiles should be put to death and there is no way they can come back into the real world... I don't want to do this alone but it feels like I have to. I don't want people to look at me and see my molester in another form...
You're not alone. You're not crazy. You're a person who was taken advantage of and traumatized. Your little kid mind didn't know what to do with it or how to process what happened to you so it started coming out in an attraction to kids. You don't need to kill yourself to save others. That would rob the planet of everything good you have to offer. It's okay to be weak. It's okay to have faults. It's okay to struggle with things like this. Everyone has issues that they have to deal with. This attraction to kids just happens to be yours. The important thing is how you handle it. It sounds like you haven't healed properly from what happened to you; that's not abnormal. I would suggest going to counseling. You're young enough you can get ahead of this and it won't screw up your life. If you don't have insurance, It doesn't have to break the bank. Most states require a counselor to offer a sliding scale of cost in case the client doesn't have insurance. Also, just be communicative with your counselor and let them know price is an issue, most of the time they'll work with you. Try out different counselors. The first one may not be the best one. It's gotta fit for both of you. Go to someone specializing in trauma. And don't let your gf get you down. If she's not willing to support you in this, she doesn't deserve you. You're a fucking gem. Don't rob the rest of us of what you have to offer bc you see one blemish.

I am so sorry that happened to you. What your old neighbor did to you and your siblings is in no way your fault. It sounds like you have a lot internal conflict with trying to cope with trauma and keep to your values. Idk if you are in the US, but here is a website to find counselors where you live: www.psychologytoday.com . Also, here is the crisis textline: 741-741. And the national suicide prevention lifeline: 1-800-273-8255. 
Look mate. We all have monsters inside of us. Every. Single. Person. For some it's sexual stuff. For others raw aggression, or a thousand other unspeakable crimes. Most people don't have the courage to confront that monster though, they prefer to deny it exists at all. That version of "self" is just too difficult to stomach.

Let me tell you something about morality. A lot of people think, "if I make myself totally harmless and *incapable* of doing any damage to others, that makes me moral". No, that's wrong. That makes you a leaf in the wind. It makes you a target for the first person who comes along who *is* capable of doing harm. It's not moral to be harmless.

What's moral is to *know* in your heart that you're capable of hurting others, but still not do it. It'll cause you to respect yourself, out of fear. That's powerful stuff. I promise you others will respect that too, unconsciously.

A person is defined by their actions, not their temptations. If you kill yourself you're removing what I see as a role model. Keep being moral. Keep being honest with yourself about your shadow. And NEVER feel like you need to "remove yourself" from existence merely because it exists -- it exists in all of us in different ways. As far as I'm concerned there are only 2 differences here: (1) you're aware of it while many aren't, and (2) you're controlling it. You being in control of it is all that matters, that makes you an upstanding person. That makes you moral.
Recognize your thoughts for what they are (as you have), accept them for what they are (do not judge, do not condemn, just notice), and it will be easier to let them go. To detach yourself from a thought is a wonderful thing. Bad temptations will come and go, but trying to observe them as a third party may aid you in handling them. Just a thought from my therapist (you should probably see one). Offing yourself in a vindictive fashion, as tempting as it sounds, isn't satisfying to you when you're not around for the reaction. Show the one who violated you that even though life isn't fair, you are capable of overcoming the shit to be around for the.... not shit.

I hope you are seeking therapy.  I hope it can help you.  Being molested is not your fault.  
I am so sorry that you had to go through that. I wish I had better advice for you... but I just want to let you know that it is amazing that you are reaching out for support. I know a lot of people struggle with this internally without ever seeking help for fear of judgment. My best advice is to try to find a counselor to work through your issues with. The fact that you're so self-aware and know where your feelings are stemming from leads me to believe that some real progress can be made with a little help from a professional. You're a good person with good intentions and I believe yu could live the life you want without any worries if you get help soon. This is no reason to hate yourself. It's not your fault.
There is a talk show who had a kid on it who said he felt the same and wanted to get help. He went to several different therapist before finding one that was right for him. I think one who specializes in sexual abuse would suffice. I wish I remembered the name of the show, but I am sure you could google it. May be a helpful listen. I too was molested. I think we all face that demon, that "worst fear" of what we could become. You need therapy. What you are saying makes me believe you are just broken still. I remember someone stating they would just scream, "No! I will NOT be a monster!" In their head every time they had a bad thought and that got them through the worst of it. Get some therapy, you are not the monster who molested you, remember that.

I think there's a misconception that pedophilia automatically makes someone a monster as if they can't control who they sleep with. I don't think you're dangerous or anything besides a normal human being going through a hard time. Lewis Carroll was a pedophile and never hurt anyone. I think he was a cool dude. You're still in charge of whether or not you molest kids, and from the looks of it I don't think you will. So don't worry so much, friend. It's our actions, not our impulses that define us. In a way, I know what you are going through. A while ago I had many symptoms of schizophrenia. I thought I was crazy, that my friends would be afraid of me and leave me if they found out, and sometimes I thought I should kill myself so I don't hurt anyone (that was just the stigma talking). Glad to say that we are both wrong there. People are much more understanding than you think. Just find someone to talk to or else pm me. It's so important to talk about it and not feel alone. We're all here for you and would never judge you. :)
Having thoughts isn't a crime and isn't wrong.  I'm a monogamous male bisexual.  Just because I'm also attracted to men it doesn't mean that I have to go out there and have sex with them.  I did before I met my wife - but now I'm totally dedicated.  I used to hate myself for being bisexual... and thought that when I was raped by a man it was my fault.  I've moved past that now - don't blame myself anymore - and don't hate myself for also being into men.  You need to try and come to terms with yourself.  And part of your terms needs to be that you won't make advances on minors and you won't watch child porn.  You can do it - but it'll take a little radical acceptance.
It is not your fault you think like this....

you are really a good/strong person that you have these attractions and don´t act on it......

so long you don´t harm anyone you are not a bad person
Great answer, and I think you are absolutely in the right profession.
She doesn't know about it. She doesn't know that I'm attracted to kids. I don't know what she would do if she did know. We have been dating for 11 months today.
I've just started a new therapist and we are still in the starting stages. I haven't ever told a therapist about being attracted to kids tho. And I don't think I can....
I don't think they can legally tell anyone if you have not committed a crime but I'm not sure.  Being conscious of your thoughts is a good start because you recognize you're thinking it but the thought feels wrong, so now you have the opportunity to correct it....sometimes therapists can help you get there, but you have to tell them like...everything.  what if they tell you it is normal behavior for an abused child and it can be helped or corrected?  
So I'm gay (am a girl), came out for the first time 2 years ago this Thursday. I'm also struggling with a lot of mental health issues, and have told no one (besides you internet folk and joking with my friends about our instability). I feel like I'm going through a lot of the same processes: online me, where I was "out" first as well, feels separate from the me others perceive me as. 


I'm scared of how saying something makes it real, what if I'm making it all up, how can I be so sure... etc etc. Also scared of how people will treat me differently, of people kind of *knowing something that had been private before*


More specific to mental health, I'm scared I'm just going to be told I don't have a problem and I've just been making excuses for myself. Caught up in the wave of online mental health romanticization.



I know I shouldn't ask you guys *if* I should get help or if I have a problem. So I just want to know how. Right now I feel a million miles away from expressing my thoughts, just like 2 years ago. Btw I also suck at coming out, to this day. Most of it is preceded by hours of anxiety and inability to focus on anything else. And it's hard to motivate myself to do so.
I'm also a gay woman. I had psychosis. Telling my family about being gay was just as hard as 'coming out' as mentally ill. Luckily, they're really supportive about both! :)
I told my friend once. The response was nothing at all. Lol. Ah, we have a long way to come. Hopefully, coming out to being gay, mentally ill, or a liberal in the south (dammit) will be easier the further we progress. 
I'm glad they responded well!


 For being gay, I knew my parents would be at the very least fine with it (I live in a very liberal area). For "coming out" as mentally ill though, I don't know. I was misdiagnosed with anorexia a while back and they were suddenly walking on eggshells the entire time. I mean obviously they will help me find resources, but I don't want to be handled like I have a FRAGILE stamp on me.
the liberal in the south part must be rough. I've been raised in an extremely liberal environment, went to Arkansas last year for a couple days and it was an entirely different world.


That sucks (@your friend). I feel like my best friend and I have been drifting apart lately because I just don't talk to her about this kind of stuff, even in a joking matter. She's probably the only healthy one out of my main group of friends...

I'm not well, and I'm so 'not well' that I can't get help. 

Today I found that I don't want to die. It's an improvement, because for a while I've felt comfortable and relaxed with the idea of death; everything ending at once, never having a thought or feeling again, not existing. I was at peace with it, which is not good at all. But today I don't want to die.

I know if I wasn't broken though, that I could do so much better than surviving. I don't do anything, I sit in my room at my dads house and watch TV or sleep and wait to talk to my online boyfriend, because he's the only thing in life that matters to me. I've never had ambition or dreams to chase, I've never had a career I wanted, I don't know how far back being 'broken' goes but I really feel like it's always been there even as a kid. I remember as a kid I'd thought it'd be easiest to just be a prostitute and didn't think past that, it didn't matter. 

I'm so tired. I don't remember the last time I could think with a clear head it's been so long. Every day, foggy and sleepy and scared. Every day on the edge of tears without realizing it or knowing why. Every day struggling to hold onto any feeling I can muster so that I don't fall back into feeling numb. I can't keep track of time well, I have no idea if something happened a few days ago or a few weeks ago or a few months ago. I'm unsure if some things actually happened at all, sometimes I don't know if I'm awake.

I made an online friend somewhat recently, and we bonded and related over being terribly depressed, anxious, and living for our SO. It was so nice, to talk to someone and have them just /get/ it. 

I'm only 22, I've been fighting for years, and I can't get help because I am tired and afraid. I can't make phone calls, I can't go out by myself. I don't really have any friends to come with me.

Sorry to post when you can't help me either, I know that. But it seems like I'm running out of people who want to listen to me talk about my problems, so it'd mean alot to me if you could read and reply. I'm so lonely.
I'm hoping since I feel a little better today, maybe good things will happen for me soon? I haven't touched a cigarette in weeks, I've been getting a little more nutrition in my diet. I've been doing what I can, even if it isn't much. 

I don't know if it's noteable progress just to not want to die, but I feel like it is.
I know how you feel. I live for my SO but it's hard on him. I'm happy one minute and sad the next. And I'm also very desperate. I don't know what wil happen to me, I only know that I want it to stop! I want to be happy. I want to work and studie but I'm stuck and I have no idea why.. If you want to talk, you can talk to me. I want someone to understand me too. Best of luck anyway
I am sorry to hear of your struggles, have you ever considered joining a forum?  I think it might be very beneficial for you as you would have plenty of people to talk with about similar stuff!

Hi!

I'm sorry to hear you're feeling so terribly, I definitely know where you're coming from. Chronic depression cosumed me for the majority of my childhood (21F), and I now feel the best I can remember feeling, so I wanted to pass on things I wish people would have told me when I first started the journey to healing. 

I would say diet, sleep, stress management, and exercise are the main ones to worry about. Social support is another but that's typically hard to improve when feeling down. And, if you're up for it, try searching for a good therapist.

- Diet: Making sure you're getting proper nutrition has the potential to help a ton since your body needs certain nutrients to make the neurotransmitters that make your feel good. Staying away from refined sugar, eating nuts and a variety of fruits and vegetables will help. Also, try adding some probiotics to your diet (yogurt, kefir, kombucha, etc) to get some good bacteria in your gut if it's low, look up gut-brain axis if you're curious. If you're able to go to the doctor have your vitamin D levels checked or if you know you don't get enough sunlight / it's winter where you are, I would definitely take a vitamin D supplement.

- Sleep: Try to go to bed and get up at the same time and sleep for 7-9 hours. Try taking some melatonin if you have trouble sleeping, but you only need a little bit (1-3 mg), any more and you'll feel pretty groggy the next day.

- Stress management: Super important, the negative effect stress, especially chronic stress, has on the body is tremendous. I would strongly suggest trying to make a habit of setting aside a small chunk of time every day that you dedicate to yourself to relax. This could involved yoga, meditation(the headspace and insight mobile apps are amazing), prayer (if you're religious), saunas, and the list goes on.

- Exercise: Personally, I really don't like running and especially running outside. If you're not comfortable exercising outside that's totally cool, there are plenty of things you can do inside. Really, you just want to be able to get your heart rate up for a little while. For me, since exercising outside was tough, I got a bike trainer for my bike and all you do is hook your bike up to it and you can exercise inside. It's pretty awesome. I did an insane amount of research and found this one http://www.performancebike.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/mProduct4_10551_10052_1111869_-1 was the best for the money.

Feel free to ask for more info, I sincerely hope it helps and gives you hope. Try to be positive =)
I can also relate, I am super dependant on my husband to the point of smothering I'm sure. Without him I have zero intention of surviving at the moment but hey I'm alive and that makes others happy and they make me happy so it's worked this far. The worst part for me is when I feel so bad it makes me feel separated from everyone even my husband, it is so lonely :( But this reddit has been amazing and so I want to say hello and your not alone. 
Hey there! Congrats on the progress! It may seem so little in the eyes of those who don't understand the struggles with depression, but being able to manage for a day is a day worth of great achievement. I  am so glad you decided living is a better option and am proud of you for taking better care of yourself -- you deserve your love and care more than anyone. If possible, please try and go outside for a brisk walk when there is light. It could even be just a 15-minute stroll just for the start. I had a really hard time eating and sleeping when depression hit me hard. A little walk in the light helped a whole lot.
If you decided to take a walk, try to look around a little bit -- the sight of Spring is lovely. :)
It's definitely progress! Every little bit is something, and it doesn't matter if, whatever it is, doesn't feel like progress to someone else, as long as its progress to you.

Joy Hibbins lies. She runs a business that competes with local MH services so she needs to show them in a bad light (but notice that she never declares this interest).

She does not have any relevant medical or psychological qualification. She doesn't have any professional registration. Her business is not registered with Charity Commission. It's not registered with the Information Commissioner. The volunteer staff might have a registration, but that's likely to be a low level registration with something like BCAP.

She mentions a BBC report. In that report you can see her, a person with no training, no qualification, no professional registration, (who knows if she's even insured or not), enter the home of a vulnerable person to provide "help". Notice that Joy lies about the crisis team - the local team is a 24 hour service. Joy uses the wrong phone number for publicity. http://www.2gether.nhs.uk/files/CRHTT_web%20feb%202014%20Gloucestershire%20web.pdf

(For clarity: I don't work for any organisation that competes with Joy's business.)
yes true, this would be surely ocurred, so need to think and learn about it, https://www.marham.pk/healthblog/7-common-mental-disorders-in-children/
You may be 100% right; IDK. But as regards the article, in my experience in the *publicly* (not privately) funded mental health arena in the US, it's pretty accurate. 
I feel like I'm always stuck inside my head. When I'm not comfortable with a group of people I don't express myself, instead my mind wanders and I start to wonder why am I not contributing to the conversations Why can't I think of anything witty to say?

Before I know it I've lost track of the conversation.

I try to listen once again, but within a second I've wandered back up into my head and detached myself from the moment.

When I finally speak I clutch at the air for words and phrases. I start a sentence and have no idea how to finish it because rather than let it flow, I'm thinking about every possible outcome in my head. I think where is this going, what am I saying, people are looking at me funny, This isn't going to be interesting.

I listen to the tone of my voice and couldn't imagine a more uninspired and dull tone; absolutely no one values what I'm saying. Every time I talk I feel the energy in the room disappear, the flow stops and I'm left feeling like I just murdered the conversation.

My confidence has been ground to a pulp, what the hell is wrong with me.
It's a complicated number of things but basically anxiety impairs cognition which itself creates more anxiety. It's the reason your mind seems to go blank during those situations. 
I have  this too. Made major  progress on it in recent months, but a total disaster backside last night, so I'm on your spot now. 

No idea if it was just one bad night, or something that will take time to rebuild from. Either way,  what worked for me was approaching every day with a mindset that I wanted to make and build personal connection with anyone there is an opportunity to do that with. Often it was short exchanges, but the way out of this in my case was to break that social anxiety mental block in a 'Death by 1000 papercuts' way, chipping away a little here, a little there, trying to create a pattern and routine of the right mindset and right action.  

EDIT: oh, in my case, I also have a problem hearing in a certain frequency that happens to be the din of party chatter, that it's hard to pick out enough consecutive sounds from a person to understand them. In those cases, I just agree and smile and try to mirror their emotion as they're talking. 
Sometimes we get into a hole and it is okay to feel the way you are feeling. Somedays you will be better with this, other days worse. Focus on the people you are comfortable talking with, love you or understand your having trouble. 
Also I suggest looking into journalling, this should help get out your thoughts without having to speak out loud. There are a few different ways you can do this, just research which sounds best for you.
No joke, try recording yourself. Audio diaries or whatever. Just practice talking about what you want to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8EH1_jZBl4
That's social anxiety. You worry so much about how other people will react to things you say that it holds you back from saying anything. Just try building up in smaller groups and getting more used to talking
Read up on ADD or ADHD, sounds familiar


Anyone that writes physics on the wall or door, is definitely someone awesome to be around.   Love it.    Pens at the ready!   en garde!
Fellow struggling physicist here. For what it's worth, I found this inspiring and motivating. That is all.
I wish I could do this with anything. You have a gift.
They didn't appreciate it at the mental hospital. I think covering my fridge with whiteboard markers is probably safe. 

Love this. My son who has ADHD is going to a school that uses techniques that train the brain. We have seen a huge change. 
hey there! the arrowsmith program uses cognitive remediation exercises to help exercise and stimulate areas in the brain. One such exercise is clocks - where the kids (using a computer program) use a 2 handed clock that moves up to 10 hands. This is just one example. Since my son has been attending this program he has learned how to multiply and divide (he had difficulties concentrating long enough to count by twos prior to this). If you are interested in neuroplasticity I highly recommend reading  The Brain That Changes Itself http://adbl.co/2gO0GGr  and The Brain's Way Of Healing http://adbl.co/2fUfJkQ The most exciting part of all the research that is being done is knowing that we are not hardwired. With work and elbow grease we can change our mental health. It's interesting how neuroplasticity can be both positive and negative. The more exercise the negative the more it grows. It's a matter of switching it up. Mindfulness and meditation works wonders :)

May I ask what techniques the school uses? I'm very curious! Not a parent nor do I have ADHD but my mental health is poor so Im curious!
At first I thought it was depression but tests suggested that I suffer a serious case of Social Anxiety Disorders. I can't live with school, I can't make friends, I feel that everyone thinks I'm creepy and worthless, I can't even say hi to anyone without thinking about it for a few minutes. It's about time I visit a Doctor, but my family think Anxiety doesn't exist, and that I'm just shy and overly-spoiled, and I can't even tell them that I actually have a mental illness cause they'll just laugh.
[Social anxiety disorder](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=social%20anxiety%20disorder) is largely [cognitive](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cognition+definition) and treatable with the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), the [10 StEPs](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-10-steps-of-emotion-processing.html), and [schema therapy]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy). Many of these are doable in inexpensive workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cbt+workbooks+for+anxiety) and/or can be learned online. You might also have a look at the [patterns and characteristics](http://coda.org/index.cfm/meeting-materials1/patterns-and-characteristics-2011/) of codependency to see if you fit there. If so, [CoDA](http://coda.org/) offers a solution for that. 

If your family denies that anxiety exists, you probably come from a family that generally invalidates the experiences of others according to the family's in-[struct](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=social+construction+of+reality)-ed, [conditioned](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=operant+classical+conditioning), [socialized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=socialization+psychology) and [normalized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=normalization+social+psychology) beliefs, assumptions, presumptions, convictions, rules, etc. 

Those therapies I listed above *will* help one to see things another way, but one may need to go further with therapies like [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [SEPt]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), [BCP/MCSP]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), and/or [SP4T](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=sensorimotor+therapy). Most of these are *also* at least partly available at low (or even no) cost online or in excellent workbooks one can find online. 
People tend to dismiss or even ridicule people or concepts that make *them* feel uncomfortable. That is *their* psychological defence mechanism. Your family members feel uncomfortable and wish you to conform to how *they* experience or think about the world. Media itself has made anxiety and alienation the subject of jokes on sitcoms etc.. The media doesn't care how they affect the world as long as they get money out of it. These jokes and sitcoms give your family members fuel to decrease their uncomfortableness. 


It looks like you cannot count on your family to support you in your battle with anxiety. The same may be true with most kids at your school. Thus you need to develop your own support system in a way that you are comfortable with. This *could* be by meeting people online and joining online groups like /r/anxiety and /r/socialanxiety [they even have social anxiety group for various areas on the country like /r/SocialAnxietyNYC  /r/SocialAnxietySFBay etc. 

As far as your family goes they are being abusive whether they ultimately want to or not. /r/raisedbynarcissists has tips and support on how to deal with abusive families [even if they are not officially narcissists].  

Other posts here have other kind of info that could help you in your struggle. You have made the first BIG step in dealing with your problem simply by acknowledging and recognizing your problem. Many kids don't recognize it or they deny it and tend to get more and more angry and cynical or even violent and misanthropist. I am so glad that you did not go down that path!

Get a therapist if you can afford one. If you can find one you can click with it can make a world of difference. Therapists exist for a reason, and it doesn't make you any weaker if you seen one, in my opinion it makes you smart for realising how much they can help you.

As for the family issue, I'm not sure what to say. I just feel your pain, and I hope you figure this out. Dealing with mental illness is hard, but if you want to change I promise you that you can change. It's absolutely possible for anxiety to not be such a burden on your life.
High school was a nightmare for me.  But I mulled through it, eating lunch alone and such and finished it.  I went to college and told myself I didn't want to go through that again. It was hard, but I made like 2 friends, and they made me friends with other people.  Worked out well.  

I didn't get diagnosed with anything until 10 years after that.  I knew I had problems, but I was able to finish school, get a job, etc.  It wasn't until my livelihood was affected that I sought treatment.  And I had a traumatic event that sort of triggered everything into being 10x worse and not manageable without help.  I ended up getting two dogs and they helped me a lot.  

I guess what I'm trying to say is that, try to manage it yourself.  Do the best you can in school and think of what career you'd fit in with well that can pay the bills and make you enough money to live comfortably down the road.  That right now is more important than friends.  But that is my opinion.  I was able to focus on schooling and video games and other hobbies until I was 18-20.  I accomplished a lot and that made me happy.  I had a loner girlfriend who was also sort of an outcast.  My sexual drive when I was a teenager was insane.  It helped a lot to have a girlfriend.  But she did outgrow me because I was an absolute loner and was happy doing things alone rather than with people.  Yeah, it sucked to not have friends, but I fixed that sort of in college.  

Figure out what will make you happy.  The worst people are the ones with no hobbies and who are only happy when they are in a group of people.  They end up with nothing to contribute when they get older.  Hope some of this helps you.  
You can't do anything about what other people think or feel. You're doing the right thing for yourself and that's awesome! Try to focus on that and maybe down the road they'll change their minds or you can figure out how to talk to them about it with help of your therapist.
It sucks but getting help is the right thing.
Try to get them involved or encourage you to do activities which will not only greatly help with your anxiety, but also them. Some to focus on would be routine exercise and mindful meditation, a well balanced diet cutting out excess sugars and caffeine, and more social interaction/communication between you all. 

When you say your family finds it a joke, families are large and come in all shapes and sizes. Is there someone you trust more than any of them there? Talk to that member personally, outside of the peer pressure of the entire collective. Slowly you'll regain that familial trust that you think is breaking down as one by one realize it's something you are struggling with. 

As another user mentioned, definitely go seek professional help in regards to short and long term needs on your part. It can be costly, but I believe there are some subsidized or even free clinics for those who feel extremely bad. Even try calling an anxiety hotline of that nature and I'm sure they'll point you in the right direction. 

Best of luck! 
Don't assume anything.  There is a surprising amount of bad information and bad advice out there.  You DON'T get what you pay for.  I seem to have had more success researching the hell out of things and gradually figuring out what works for me.   

People often judge way too much, as if addicted to it like a bad habit.  Sneaking in hits here-and-there and anywhere they can get away with it.  

Don't be surprised if "professionals" hurt more than they help, or you have to see scores of people before you find just one person that is reasonable and might be able to help.  The vast majority of people that go into that field are injured themselves.
You're thinking of seasonal affective, not social anxiety.
Hi! My name is Morgan and for my Gold Award I'm making care packages for youth ages 0-25 with mental illnesses or mental health issues through a system I've created called Boxes for Warriors. Check it out if you, or someone you know, can apply! boxesforwarriors.weebly.com
I would definitely pay for shipping to New Zealand for one of these
This is so sweet, thank you
thank you for doing this<3
Would these boxes be shipped in a way that identifies that they are mental health related? I can't think of a good way to word this, sorry if it's confusing, but would they be, like, discretely shipped if that makes sense? I guess I'm wondering if they would be covered in quotes or something about how "you can do it!" "just keep trying" "You can beat this" etc...The person I wanna nominate lives with roommates and I wouldn't want to make them feel awkward about it.
Wow, this is a really great thing you're doing!
What an uplifting idea. I applied for one as I have been ...kind of down lately. Even therapy has been more stress than relief. Bless your heart for such a compassionate project.
What a wonderful idea, if I was in America I would nominate a friend for sure (they are in more need than I am :) ) It's enlightening to see young people caring and raising awareness about this incredibly common and yet highly stigmatised issue, thank you. 
beautiful
This is a really great thing you're doing! Thank you so much, just knowing the fact that somebody cares and wants to help makes my heart so happy, I signed up for a box and am in tears right now lol
Unfortunately, that seems a little against the point. Because its a girl scout project, it's kinda hard to fundraise, but if, for blessing of a reason, I have extra money I can let you know! 
hello fellow kiwi in need of a mental health care package, stay strong friend 
Not at all (unless someone asks for it) If you want to remind me, just leave a comment somewhere on the application! 
Sorry, I'm not sure how the girl scout programme works - but it is such a great idea! Damn New Zealand being so far away...
We can't really take money from people, just supplies, unless we set up a fundraiser event that a board approves. It's just a bit of a hassle to get a ton of money and not supplies. I'll try my hardest though. You should apply just in case, and even if I don't have a ton of money, maybe I can send you a note card or something! 

I've suffered from poor mental health since I was a small child, all the way to now as an adult. I know it will never go away, I know it just gets better and worse in cycles. It's genetic, my whole family has it.  

If I meet someone whom I truly love, wouldn't the best thing I could do would to not let them get close to me?  

My father killed himself, and it ruined my mum's life. Why should I start down that road myself and ruin another person's life because of my own selfishness? I'm not even saying it has be about death, but in general, after living with someone for years and years my illness will surely begin to take a toll on them.


My very closest friends, including my boyfriend, all have mental health problems (with some being quite severe), and I can assure you that I wouldn't trade them for anyone else ever, regardless of their mental state. The fairest and least selfish thing you can do is to let others choose whether they want to be with you or not. No matter what you feel about yourself, it is not up to you to judge whether you think they will be happier with or without you, because you will most certainly be very biased and incorrect in that judgement. Sure, you might cause each other pain somewhere down the road, that happens. But you will also give each other equally as much good in return. If any of my current friends or my partner had ever excluded themselves simply because they were concerned of *my* mental state, they would have made a terrible mistake. I love them for exactly who they are, and I honestly think that the fact they are not like everyone else just makes me love them even more. 

They are broken, but also the most beautiful people I've met. They would never think so of themselves, but thats because they can't see what I see. Sure, I probably like them particularly much because I struggle as well, but at least we can understand each other in some ways, despite having very different issues. We all know we hate ourselves, but we aldo know we love each other (despite our constant doubt in others), and that really helps. I'm not saying things will be great, but its worth a try. Actually, it's worth several tries. As many as you need till it works out. But the point is, from someone who is close to many others with terrible problems, even abusive issues occasionally, I still love them and would never want them out of my life. I know why they act like they do, and I accept it, because I understand them. And even if I don't sometimes I still wouldn't want to not have them in my life.
Instead of focusing on your influence on a potential partner, perhaps focus on what you can do to be stable. It sounds like you feel like you have to wrestle with mental illness the rest of your life, which sounds to me like you're not in recovery mode. It just pains me when people think they have to struggle with mental health for their whole lives. I'll clarify what I mean.

I have Bipolar I Disorder. I have had three psychotic episodes, specifically manic, and I am mentally healthy now and anticipate that I will never have another episode. I feel that way because I am on a medication that basically saved my life - it's a monthly injection I only pay $10 for - I am very aware of my moods and act accordingly, and I surround myself by people who care and will help me get help.

I think the most important thing is finding a medication that works and sticking with it, if the severity of the mental illness calls for it. It is additionally important, according to therapists I've had, to have multiple outlets, such as writing, drawing, playing music, etc. as well as have steady people in your life who are healthy and good for you.

I would focus on these things before looking for a partner and especially before convincing yourself you can't live a happy, healthy life. You CAN live a happy, healthy life with a mental illness. I am proof of that!

I have been consistently mentally healthy for 2 and a half years now, with occasional days of mild depression or mania. It's all about learning how to manage it and what works for you. I manage it through medication and coping mechanisms.

I have so much more to say about your post, but I just want you to hear from someone who has severe mental illness that it is possible to live a happy, healthy, and successful life. I am a teacher, and no one at my workplace has even the slightest idea that I have a mental illness.

I realize I didn't exactly answer your question, but I hope this helps. You don't have to be a burden to your partner, and you shouldn't have to be either. Romance is absolutely an option for you. I am just saying that I would see what you can do to get yourself stable first. Much love.
I have BP1 and I let someone I start to have feelings for early on so they can make that choice. I've been with my SO for a year and a few months with on break in between. I feel guilty sometimes because I know how hard it is to deal with my during an episode. I know that progressively this will get worse with age and I will change, but he's an adult and he made his choice, and that was me.

I do, however, recommend therapy for who ever you choose to be with.  That way they don't get worn down, and they are able to express themselves and their frustrations with you in a safe judgement free space.  
I share with my partner that I suffer from severe depression.  I try to be a good partner.  I do not think it's fair to say those suffering from mental illness don't deserve love.  If you make your partner aware there is no problem.  

Don't be ashamed of your disease and don't believe it or anyone else telling you that you don't deserve love.
It depends on what your mental illness is, I suppose. I have [Aspergers Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome) and am happily engaged to a wonderful, neurotypical woman. I wouldn't trade it for the world.
I've struggled with OCD since early adolescence. Yes, it's taken toll on my relationships, especially before my diagnosis. One of those horrible relationships actually led me to seek help, which led to a few years of therapy and medication. 

I'm very open with my partners, especially my current partner, about my struggles. I've found that if a person doesn't accept your diagnosis and healing process, then that person is not worth your time.

Mental illness is a part of you. It's just a part of who you are. No one is their diagnosis. 

So yes, if you meet someone that you care for and treats you well, go for it.

Everybody needs love, OP. 
As a psychiatrist i'd say that a relationship can be stressful.

Stress is a trigger for mental illness. The more the illness advanced the lesser you tolerate stress. The more you recover the more you tolerate it.

Should you avoid a really stressful event? The answer depends of various factors. Risk and benefits must be evaluated. Your Doctor, psychologique, social worker, friends, family should help with this ...

In a romantic relationship you are asked to just go with it and see what happens next. 

Your question is a big challenge for the whole society !!! 


In my personnal view : just go with it, be honest and assertive and don't just try to cope with everything alone
You HAVE a mental illness. That does not mean you ARE a mental illness. That is just a piece of you. You are so much more than just having a mental illness. I've also dealt with it all of my life, but I live life with it, to the best of my ability. It sucks but you have to continue life the best way you can. If that means falling in love, then more power to you dude! The right person will love you and your illness. It's not easy but that's how true love works.

Oooh what medication? Im bipolar as well and taking a handfull of pills everyday gets annoying. 
People with or without psychological disorders are capable of negatively impacting on relationships. Everything in life has its ups and downs, if you're able to roll with it and able to handle it when things get pear shaped then having a psychological disorder shouldn't hinder you getting into a relationship.
Message me. :)

I think therapy has its pros and its cons. Group therapy has also been more of my thing though.
Some people in therapy are turned into perpetual infants, relying on others to tell them what's wrong with them, what's right and what to do about it. They never learn to look into their problems themselves and resolve them. They don't learn that they must accept responsibility for the state of their own minds. They end up depending on their therapists like children and never grow up.

Others do well in therapy. They don't keep at it for decade after decade. They learn what they can from it, apply it and move on.
That first paragraph isn't exactly what people need to hear if they're considering going to therapy. If that does happen, it's on the therapist to help them break that dependency. 
I don't like that you give zero options for people who use the therapy to improve themselves, but are also in situations where therapy is going to be a long-term part of the solution. Seems to me that your "either this or that" is lacking a lot of gray area. 
I guess I'm speaking from my own experience. I'm sure others may have other experiences and not become dependent for life. My sister who has bpd is only one example of a person who has remained dependent on a therapist for 30+ years and never actually solved any problems.
I'm a 20 year old female and I've never known him any other way. He was like that since ever. He has schizophrenia and he takes meds like zyperxa and other stuff that I don't remember.

His meds cause him to walk a lot all day and stay up for so long then sleep. 

He tries to talk to people but they always ignore him. It's like what he's saying is not worthy. I think what he says is worthy, and whenever he talks to me I give him all the attention he needs but then someone interrupts our conversation just to talk to me. Then I try to stop that person from interrupting us but they insist that I'm stuck there listening to him so they cut it.

He has a car so they only remember him when they need a ride. He doesn't work so he's always home. They remember that he exists when they want someone to get them dinner or lunch. They steal his personal stuff like shoes whenever they want to go for a quick run. They take his car when he's asleep without asking him. He doesn't have anyone that he can open up to. He doesn't use the Internet, he doesn't have friends, he's just wandering around the house all day long.

**I really want to help him, but I'm scared that he might lash out at me. He threatens to kill when he has one of his episodes. I don't know what to do. He has no life, but I took a course in psychology at my university last semester and it has opened me up. I know for sure that schizophrenia is not the end of the world. Especially his type! He has auditory hallucinations.** 

Please help. Tell me that he still has hope. He's drowning in medication and he does nothing valuable in life because of how people at my grandmother's house are treating him. 

**Also, and most importantly, people at my grandmas think that he doesn't feel anything, that's why they keep on hurting and ignoring him, does he really not feel anything? Does medication make him numb and emotionless?**
Thank god for people like you.  
[Here](http://www.schizophrenia.com/coping.html#) is a list of support groups that may help you learn to help him. Best of luck.
The world needs more people like you.  I couldn't tell you if he feels or not but even if he doesn't he is still human with needs and wants and nobody, feelings or not, likes to be alienated.
Even if you don't understand what he's going through a little blind support goes a long way.
Sounds like we've got a real human being out there, name is /u/Thrvvo. If this humanity stuff they are into in them starts to grow, we may have to take action or there's a danger that the scummy assholes will lose their stranglehold on things and people with big hearts might actually make this world a better place. But truly caring people are so few and far between that we probably don't have much to worry about. Just to be on the safe side, if you see this person, try to discourage them from having a heart and whatever you do, don't let them read Charles Dickens. 
He definitely has hope!  Are there any hobbies he used to enjoy?  You could look into learning them yourself and doing them together.
Schizophrenia is really a disease of being dissociated from one's own feelings.  It's not that he doesn't feel or can't — he has emotional needs that aren't being dealt with and are firing off randomly trying to get solved.  If anything, the way the family is treating him is making it worse because it's driving him deeper into emotional isolation.  Abandoning a schizophrenic means leaving it up to them to figure out how to get better which means letting those voices he hears represent his entire ability to cope with his own problems.

Maybe become his friend in private so the family doesn't interfere.  Just having someone in his life who doesn't actively abuse him would be a tremendous improvement to his life.


If he has attacks randomly could he attack verbally mid sentence?    It hard to be open when you are attacked randomly.   

Has he attacked you?     Nevermind his illness where do you find safety in your interractions.  I know that only ~7% of the mentally ill are violent.  It sounds like your family have found safety in distance. 

Btw.  Are you sure he's taking his meds daily?

Can I get this as a fifteen reasons why suicide isn't the answer? I want number five to be the one I didn't see coming.
It seems to me that her disposition was only re-enforced. In the beginning she insinuated that living out of obligation made her tired of existing. Then Robin Williams death made her realize how "selfish" suicide was. What's she going to do now that she really feels like she *can't* kill herself?
[deleted]
Feeling trapped in addition to suicidal ideation is not a good mix. 
It made me feel shittier, too, but I don't blame her for it. I'm not supposed to be here for anyone. Some days I want to be here for me, but my family can deal with whatever choice I eventually make.

Number 7 hit home for me. Yes I can stand in front of a room of 500 people and give a speech, but no I can't buy milk at the grocery store without an escort. I'm fully aware that it makes no sense, in fact it's not making sense is one of the reasons I knew I had a problem in the first place!
[deleted]
so much <3
I'm all for spreading awareness and compassion. That being said the tone of this blog is obnoxious. I believe number nine was being told one is behaving like a child.

If you process your issues in this way and present them to others in the same entitled manner as this author...you're behaving like a child.

Getting better requires meeting the world half way. You can't do that with such a fuckin chip on your shoulder.

Exactly, if it made sense it would be normal. It's very hard to explain this.
You're welcome 
Firstly, I'm the author and I appreciate your feedback.

While in part I would agree, and getting better does require accepting the world as it is and taking responsibility for your own recovery. I have overcome the majority of my disorder, I can do things now that I never expected I would be doing in a million years. 

That being said, simply being told off the bat "don't be childish" or "it's just an excuse" if you struggle to do something due to a mental illness can be quite damaging to self esteem and in turn can hinder progress considering the disorder is a mental illness that focusses it's main attention around  what other people think of you. 

I'm not speaking for myself because I believe I've been socially anxious since I was far too young to remember but quite a large group of socially anxious people developed their anxiety from bullying or from being mistreated. Not surprising really if people mistreat you or make you feel like shit that you're going to develop a fear of people.

Yes, the whole world isn't going to love you and it's important to make those realisations in your journey to recovery, that it's okay if some people don't like you and at the same time not everyone is out to get you.     The changes have to come from you though, not other people belittling you and putting pressure on you to become "normal"



My stupid phone auto correct .. Supposed to be kiss my ass
well done! :D
Yay!!! :)
Nice job! Now go conquer something else!
Nice legs
what does "kid my ass depression" mean?

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAaaaaaaaa!
Growing up for the most part I felt pretty intelligent for a kid, and of course my parents , family , and friends would say I seemed smart and that sort of thing (not that I ever let it get to my head or something like that ) . But the older I get it seems like it's becoming increasingly difficult to even think . In the past couple of years it has become way worse than before . Even stringing together a coherent sentence is sometimes a challenge and I'll find myself often using words and saying things that probably makes no sense to anyone but me because I can't think of the correct words to use. Anytime i have to actually think about something , like anything from someone asking me a question to problem solving , It's like there is a tornado filled with garbage thoughts spinning in my brain but somewhere deep in the tornado is the thought that I need to be focusing on and if I'm lucky it might pass by me just long enough to attempt to come up with some response or solution to what's going on around me . And that "tornado" is always there , no matter what I'm doing i just have a constant stream of random pointless thoughts going through my mind . My social skills has almost completely dissappeared , I hardly know how to function around a group of people anymore and find myself feeling awkward and out of place . It's extremely hard for me to carry a conversation now and if I do it usually seems very generic and scripted. It's almost physically hurts to read and processes information.  If I read anything I usually can't remember what I just read and have a hard time understanding it if I do . Its becoming very hard to take in almost any kind of knowledge.  I know this is now me and I feel trapped in my own mind that seems to be growing more dull every moment . Its hurting my marriage , my job  and is holding me back as a parent.  I would appreciate any advice .


I don't have any advice for you, but I'm experiencing kind of the same thing. It's very frustrating...I'll wait for responses with you.
Are you taking Venlafaxine by any chance? 
Should always consult a psychiatrist and not diagnose, much less treat, yourself, but your description of this heavy mental fog (and its exponentiation) is highly reminiscent of how I feel and operate as an ADHD-afflicted adult.  My Ritalin prescription helps a *great deal* in disbanding or at least thinning the tornado, or affording me a giant's arms with which to properly wrangle the misty beast.  Drinking a *lot* of fucking water throughout the day is important as well.  
Have you tried sorting out things with your diet and exercise? Like really dive in and make sure you are consistently getting the vitamins and nutrients you need from fresh food, and develop some fitness goals to help keep you active.  

Also what are some of your hobbies? Maybe something exciting could give you a boost, or meditation to calm your thoughts.  I know once I started taking care of my body and searching for things to drive me it was easy to shake off some cobwebs and feel sharp again. ;)

Probably took too much drugs in your childhood, im having the same problem
As this is /r/mentalhealth and not /r/philosophy I'll try to not stray too far into left field.

I work in education (I'm not based in the classroom, but I sit, plan and work with classroom educators at least half of my day).  A fairly common theme is how (near) constant exposure to technology is changing the way we think.  

Put simply: recall is becoming less of a *useful* skill as the ability to readily access/utilize information becomes more pervasive.

Additionally, the constant flux in the professional and social arenas are a rapid cycle of *necessary* information.

On a regular basis, I observe intelligent people reach for their phones to look up fairly trivial things... things that twenty years ago they would have simply summoned from memory.  Yet, these same people can spew nonsense such as "re-engineer extensible partnerships" or "drive magnetic functionalities" and be understood by their peers.  [Yes, I did just throw bullshit corporate buzzwords together... but you hopefully get my point.]

On the social side, consider the mental gymnastics necessary from month to month, year to year to keep up with the ever shifting library of memes, cultural references, political buzzwords, etc...

We're a long way from a world where 13 channels on the television was considered more than enough to occupy your time.

The modern brain is evolving (for better or worse) to categorize relatable information into hashtags and a certain kind of collective thought reinforced by professional and social echo chambers; we don't *correspond*, we text, tweet and update others regarding our life with 15 seconds of video.

Hell, this post is an example... I regularly fail at Reddit as I am prone to write; and, if someone commits that social faux pas, they're supposed to *TLDR* it at the very least.

Now, combine the possibility that there is some validity to the above with the reason that people frequent this subreddit...

Many medications used to address mental/behavioral disorders have side effects on cognitive functions.  And that is on top of the stress (of the mental/behavioral disorders themselves) that impact cognitive functions. (And this is without touching other factors such as poor dietary choices, lack of exercise, not enough attention/focus on mindfulness, etc...)

I could keep going, but I won't.  I think my point is this:  information overload + compromised mental health = a fuck all of  a combination.

Speak to your doctor/care provider about your concerns.  Take some time for yourself.  Try some intellectually stimulating side activities (writing is a great one!).  Consider your diet and extend yourself beyond your comfortable social groups (which will require you to absorb new information and communicate in new ways with different people).

Be well, mate.
Let me know if you find a hack and I'll do the same. :/
Lol well hopefully we will find something out
I am experiencing very similar sort of mind dumbening and disconnect (recently also bad memory but that may be the Gabapentin which I started a year ago). This has been going on for many many years now with worsening results.

I used to be good at school, I loved math and was very passable at chemistry. Now I'd have to think before I could answer what 2 + 2 is.

Same here!
No , why do you ask ?
This is something I've brought up to my psychiatrist, but she kind of waved it off and I don't know how to bring it back up...
I was prescribed Ritalin as a kid but it made me sleepy and it was during the time where doctors was over prescribing Ritalin to everyone so my parents really didn't want me to have it so I stopped . I didnt take it long enough to tell a difference. I probably need to look into adult ADHD but I don't think there is any way I could afford a psychiatrist 
This could probably be a big part of it . I don't have a completely horrible diet but it's not good and I tend to overeat. I certainly haven't checked for vitamin intake or anything like that and I'm not exactky sure where to get reliable information for it . 

 As for hobbies ... well not much lately . Video games and drawing has been about as far as it goes and I certainly need to find something more active to do . Thank you for the help
Ha , nah I never really messed with drugs . 
Wow man thank you , you out did yourself . I am going to see a doctor and maybe look into a psychiatrist if I can afford it . I definitely need to change my diet though . Just wondering in your personal opinion , do you prefer what the modern brain is evolving into and think maybe we should embrace that and hopefully work out the problems with that along the way ? Or do you think we need to resist the change and put down the phones to start making the time for more in depth interaction with both the the knowledge we take in and the people around us again ?
I've experienced the same thing. I was 'above average' in academics, socially adept, and could participate in discussions in a meaningful way. (And often lead them.) 

And, just like you, I've grown a little dumber every year since my early 20s. (I'm 29) Spelling has become difficult, and like you said, my ability to retain info suuuuucks. That's just one example. 

I've taken an SSRI since I was 15, do you think that can cause memory erosion? Or maybe it's trauma related. Or anxiety related.


Anyway, you're not alone. I appreciate you writing this because nobody else has ever understood me when I say I'm getting dumber!



I have the same symptoms and discovered that a bunch of people online realised that it was the meds doing it. I hope that your brain fog clears soon. 
I'm glad that I'm not alone .  Anyone I try to talk to about it usually just says I'm using it as an excuse and say i act that way because  "I don't care" about my job or whatever I'm trying to do . But I'm hoping I can really get rid of this now because I'm afraid even if I get it fixed it's still going to effect me later on because of a gap in my overall life experience.  Hopefully we can both get it sorted out as soon as possible. 

 I don't take SSRI and I don't think I have had any major truama but I have wondered if it's anxiety based . The more anxiety I have certainly amps up the problem.
This quote has helped me so much , even if I feel like someone thinks I'm annoying or mean I just remember that it's none of my business. What do you guys think? This quote is a RuPaul quote by the way, also "If you can't love yourself how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?" 
I think it's a Wayne Dwyer quote, actually! I heard it as: "What other people think of me is none of my business." I love it and it gives me so much freedom.

EDIT: Just checked, it goes way back beyond either Wayne Dwyer or RuPaul. TIL!
Well what your describing is something different entirely. We have to interact with people and their thoughts about us alter the interaction, it has nothing to do with us being pissed off or upset that someone might think we're a "loser" but more to do with how the balance of power is being displaced. I always try to create a situation where I feel valued and the other person isn't trying to over take me in some way or another. But this can also just be ego, and we can believe that people are trying to belittle us when all they're trying to do is be frank and clear. I think what Ru Paul is talking about, is that if someone needs to vent about you, or if you hear someone talking shut, that probably wasn't meant for your ears so don't go looking for it. Because at the end of the day the bad shit they say about you is just a reflection of how they feel inside. And their inadequacies. 

The only problem is that teenagers can be absolute assholes (source: am currently a teenager) when it comes to mental health. There's just so much stigma about getting help from councillors and other sources that it makes it socially impossible for someone to get help without being pummelled by their peers.

You tried to kill yourself about this time last year. You followed it up by drinking every day for three months and barely graduating college. And you let your depression get bad enough that you couldn't make it out of bed most days. 

But after months of struggling, you've made it. You're currently sitting in one of those cool swivel chairs at a salaried job in a field you love. Your coworkers are great, and your friendships are stronger. You're in a functioning and healthy relationship. You have a tiny but lovely apartment. You sucked it up and got back on antidepressants, but they're working, and they're good for you. You still drink too much and your left thigh will always be covered in scars, but maybe you'll be proud of them one day. Because you did it. You made it. You're okay, and a lot of the time, you're happy too. 
Love. <3
<3 Thanks for staying here with us! 
Wow this really hit home for me. Last year (Jan/feb/march) I tried to kill myself more times than I can count. Im not proud of it, but I am so glad that I went through it because out of therapy and healing from my past I've become a person that I am proud of. No more drugs or drinking for me right now! I don't feel like I need to use, and that is the best feeling there is on earth. 
I have scars on my left thigh too, and when I read that I really thought that this post was for me. I am so embarrassed of them and try to hide them all of the time, but I am confident that with time I will be proud of them. 
Im currently tapering off my antidepressant and I feel better than ever! It really is crazy how much a year can change someone. 

Some advice to all of you out there on this sub: what I've learned is that everything shitty and fucked up that's happened to me has happened for a reason, and that I am a better person because of it. When I look back on my past of sexual abuse, I don't wish that it never happened to me, because the person I am now has been greatly influenced by it and has overcome it, and I don't want that person to change. Take care of yourselves and make an effort to feel good!
Thank you for sharing!

My favorite saying lately is "Pressure makes diamonds." We wouldn't be who we are today without the struggle we went through. And I'm proud of you for getting through it! 

With time, you'll forget that your scars are even there. Remember, they're a mark of where you've been, not who you are. <3 
Im proud of you for getting through it too! :)
I am a 24 year old female with treatment refractory depression (nothing has worked so far). We are in the process of ruling out bipolar II. I know many people have reservations about this treatment option and I was hoping to clear the air! (I'm also bored because I am out work for a month for this.)
Can you give a brief rundown of a procedure itself? I'm afraid I'm just fascinated and curious, but I think knowing what goes on in the room would really help de-mystify the procedure.
So amazed to see this, literally just got home from a psychiatrist appointment where I was just added to the ECT wait list!

How are the immediate side effects so far? Any short term memory loss? Feeling out of it? Drowsy? Or relatively okay?
Did it hurt..? Probably a stupid question but it always worried me. 

Do you get memory problems with this? 
Does it carry the same restrictions on driving as a spontaneous seizure?  I.e. is your license revoked for 6 months?
How do you confirm to yourself that personality characteristics that you value before ECT remain and are still important to you after ECT?


Modern, low-amplitude ECT is great stuff for tx-resistant depression. BUT it tends not to actually *cure* it if the depression is essentially cognitive... because it does not change the core [cognitive distortions](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=cognitive%20distortions) that caused it to begin with. That said, ECT usually makes it possible for pts to participate in the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [schema therapy](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), and [CPT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy) that *can* cure it by uprooting those cognitive distortions... and [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [HBCP](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) and/or [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html) if the depression is rooted in the [learned helplessness](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=learned+helplessness) that so often results from child abuse or other severe trauma. I found, btw, that the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) in [this particular form](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/04/critical-thinking-and-logical-fallacies.html) worked better for *me* with respect to the CDs, but I expect it's a matter of what works or doesn't for any given individual.

First they test your general fitness for the procedure with lab work, and EKG and a physical. I also had to get a certification from my psychiatrist saying that I know risks and I am voluntarily consenting. 

Next they put you in pre-op. It's a room with other patients getting ready for their procedures. You get in a gown and a nurse comes and gets a thorough history on you. Then she starts an IV. They pump you full of sugar water for whatever reason. 

After a little bit of waiting the nurse will take you into the procedure room. The one where I got it done looked kind of like an extra operating theater. There were extra beds and a whole bunch of extra equipment. You lay down on the bed. The put a pillow under your head and knees. They surgical nurses apply heart, brain and blood pressure monitors on you.  The anesthesiologist pushes muscle relaxants through your IV. You are given an oxygen mask too. The anesthesiologist then gives you the general anaesthetic. I always try to fight it as long as I can whenever I'm given it. Because it's fun! I only made it through about 15 seconds before I was completely out. 

Obviously I wasn't concious for the actual procedure.  I have watched a video of one though. Once you're out they put this goop on your temples to conduct electricity better. Then they actually zap you with the machine. They will use a standard voltage. (I only got unilateral ECT meaning they only zapped one side of my head. ) The zap induces a seizure. This is thought to be what is actually therapeutic about ECT.  The seizure is monitored with the brain wave monitor(EEG). A good ECT session has a seizure that lasts 30 seconds to a minute. The whole procedure takes about fifteen minutes from when you walk in to when they wheel you to PACU. 

I woke up in PACU (the recovery room) thinking, "when are they going to do it?" Apparently it is totally normal to be a little bit confused. After a minute I came too and realized that it was finished. It took me about five minutes to come around from the anaesthesia. A nurse offered me something to drink.  I waited for about fifteen minutes and then they told me I was ready to go and to get dressed. I took my blankets off and was immediately assaulted with the smell of urine. I pissed myself! Of course they didnt bother to tell me that might happen. The nurse gave me a pair of scrub pants to ride home in though. 

Once I got home I just felt like sleeping for a few hours. I took a nap. Later in the evening I actually felt a little better already! I was more willing to do things that my depression made it hard to do. I cleaned a little and then watched Return of the Jedi which my boyfriend had been pestering me to watch for years. 

I go back for another treatment tomorrow. They are Monday, Wednesday and Friday for four weeks totalling 12 treatments. I might have to have more than that, I might have to have less. It's sort of a wait and see thing. After my treatments are done I might have to have "maintenance ECT" once a month for the foreseeable future to prevent a relapse. 
Typical procedure from doctor's perspective:

* Pre-surgical: Get into hospital gown. Start on IV electrolytes/fluids for about an hour. Verify vital signs are okay.

* Patient wheeled into room. Verify correct patient, verify exact procedure and type of ECT, verify consent. 

* Anesthesiologist begins with muscle relaxant. Dosing quite important here: Too little and the patient will be very sore when they wake up. Too much and it will take the patient a while to wake up. Next, administration of suxamethonium - the anesthetic that knocks the patient out. Other anesthetics are undesirable because they help to prevent seizures. ECT works by way of induced seizure. (And there is a reason this anesthetic is called "sux".... because it really really sucks).

* Verify patient unconscious. Double-check ECT machine settings and patient properly strapped down. Apply electrodes and shock. Verify patient vitals and EEG. 

* Send patient to post-surgical. Nursing staff monitors until anesthesia wears off and checks for any complications from anesthesia. 

* Discharge patient.
No memory loss so far. I actually have a pretty clear memory of yesterday. I hear it can get worse with more treatments though. I feel actually very energetic today! The only side effect so far are some sore muscles. 
I hope ECT helps you! I am pretty amazed by it myself. I think it's underutilized. ECT has something like a 78% rate of efficacy. 
How long is the wait list?
It doesn't hurt at all! They put you under general anesthesia for the duration of the procedure. They also give heavy duty muscle relaxants to prevent anything but your brain from seizing. I woke up with some slight soreness in my jaw on the side they zapped me. Today (the day after) I also woke up with sore muscles. It feels kind of like the way you do after you hit the gym too hard. 
No. You don't have seizures outside of the procedure so no one is worried about having one while you're driving. 
Well, the science behind ECT isn't well understood at all. It's thought that the seizures induced release extra feelgood neurotransmitters and that seizures may even help brain growth. 

Personally, knowing this tells me that it's kind of like a supercharged antidepressant. I have also read about experiences online and no one seems to have a problem with personality changes. 
ECT doesn't affect personality. It can affect memory, however.

Unilateral ECT has the least effect. Bilateral ECT is for more seriously depressed patients who do not respond to unilateral. It may cause some temporary issues with memory. 

Earlier forms of ECT actually caused terrible issues with memory. [But, ECT is now carefully done with digital machines that very precisely manipulate the electrical waveform going into your brain.](http://www.mectacorp.com/spectrum-5000Q.html)

ECT is actually now giving way to transcranial magnetic stimulation, whereby electrical current is induced rather than directly applied, and is very precisely targeted to specific regions of the brain as opposed to an entire hemisphere. It also has the benefit of requiring no recovery time (although some people have brief headaches afterwards caused by the vibrations... it literally feels like a tiny tiny hammer is being pounded against your skull).
It's a personal choice. I'm sorry it didn't work for your aunt. However I have been through the ringer between all the medications and therapy and this was a last ditch effort. I trust my doctors and the resources I have read through. I feel like a made an informed decision. There are risks with everything, including undertreated depression. 
A horrific thing? It's an amazing treatment that we in the mental health field know to be *extremely* effective and very safe. That doesn't mean that it's going to right treatment for everyone, because there is no such thing.
To be fair, as with many medical procedures, they've improved and refined the process over the years too. 
That's super interesting. Thank you for taking the time to write it out. :)
They never bothered telling you you might piss yourself? How typical, but I don't mean anything amusing by that. I assume then it's also possible to poo yourself during the procedure?
Thanks! Hopefully the success rates will work for us both (and not the relapse rates! :s)
*edit:  CLARIFICATION, I have not had ECT, I'm talking about if ECT were offered at some point.*

Not all that long ago I was really terrified by the idea of ECT and memory loss, but over the last month, I've been perusing things on my computer.  Images of my kid, events, family things and places.

And I have no recollection.

Whatever the diag ends up being for me, its very clear to me that what its doing is destroying a huge amount of memory all by itself. If it came down to ECT to stop this thing, memory effects wouldn't disturb me... though I'd make me some notes about how to get to other notes.  :-D

General anesthesia gives me quite some problems coming out though..  but long as there a few orderlies present to tackle me, it'd work out ok though.  lol.  (took three last time;  they never seem to believe me ahead of time till they say, "oh sh***" in recovery)


While I don''t really disagree, I do think the dismissive attitude often taken when someone reports very negative side effects really does the reputation of the treatment a lot of harm.

No one pretends Lithium can't do some horrible things.   ECT can also have some very negative effects, combined with the rare but also very negative possible side effects of anesthesia itself; I don't get the overly defensive or outright denial attitude.  Sympathy should rule, not invalidation.

Was it bilateral or unilateral? 

This isn't unheard of, though. You may find that your memories will return eventually. 

But, yeah, ECT is quite invasive and not to be done lightly. These side effects are part of why ECT is falling out of favor now that research shows TMS is just as, if not more, effective.
No no, mixed up OP with me.  I've not had ECT/TMS; only that that the idea no longer bothers me.  Whatever this untreated thing is, its beating the snot out of me, memory included.
Oh. Well, severe depression certainly affects memory. It can actually inhibit the formation of long-term memories. 

You may find once you are better that you may not remember much of your worst years. In long-term depression, this can be troubling to people because they'll have entire years where their memory is hazy. But it's a result of the illness itself.


The longest I've been depressed is about 3-4 months, they're very deep, but cycle... yeah that.  I'm trying to be a good varmint and not self diagnose.  And there are honestly a couple confounding factors that will likely be a huge pain in the butt to untangle.    I am working to get an eval and hopefully see someone soonish.


This is a piece I wrote in my journal just for simply cleansing/therapeutic purposes. It is unedited and raw and shittily written. I just find stuff like this interesting to read. It isn't meant to be inspirational or triggering or anything like that. I don't think I'm a special snowflake haha. I am simply posting it for anyone like me who may be curious or want to feel less alone.

Being mentally ill and suicidal at a young age is strange. You grow up with this idea that one day you’ll be brave enough to kill yourself. You don’t plan for the future. Picking my major, my 21st birthday, adulthood – planning it all seemed like a waste of time. But now that I’m here, I can’t help but feel unprepared. I admit it, I find it sickly pleasurable to press upon the memories of my darkest moments. They are bruises. I touch them where it hurts because part of me feels this is where revelations live. While I take comfort knowing that there are people who live successful lives that are like me, I struggle understanding why I was dealt this hand and what to make of it.


Sensitive is how I was made. Blessed with a childhood close to perfect, I have loving parents who raised me right and have told me I am brilliant and special. Still, I always felt a little off, like all my senses were amplified. Ever since I was a child, things hit me hard. When I got mad, I burned. When I cried, I poured. When I was happy, I glowed. It became clear early on that my life would be a hunt for balance. When I was younger I would try to block out all these voices in my heart, but how do you silence what is meant to be heard? I spent a lifetime struggling to do so, until I learned that I could not quell the roar but instead learned I have to just stand against it.


As I entered high school, I became cripplingly shy. All of a sudden, I didn’t fit in. Being two years young for my class didn’t help either. I couldn’t bear to be alone so I conveniently faked a lot of social interaction. I didn’t fit in with drama kids, or the stoners I got high with behind the bleachers, or the cheerleaders. I always thought I was so ugly. I mean, I really did. I remember being in my school’s bathroom and staring into the mirror for hours. It was like, if I looked long enough, maybe I'd finally be pretty. It never worked. I just got uglier and uglier. Nothing about me ever seemed good enough. And there was this sadness inside me - this hopelessness. Focusing on my physical appearance was at least easier than trying to address the internal stuff. I could control the external to a point. I could buy different clothes, or cut my hair, or my wrists, but the pit opening up inside me was too frightening to even look at. Things I once was passionate about left me feeling unfulfilled. Like most seniors, I was ready to get the hell out of my school and never come back. But when I was accepted into college my desire to escape turned to dread.


I was so homesick starting college that I couldn’t eat without throwing up for an entire month. Eventually, the homesickness eased and I found joy. I realized the power that comes when you stop seeking approval and validation from others. Day by day I was learning and exploring myself. Looking back, I realize how small my world was pre college. At my university, people challenged my world and the way it was, which I loved. I questioned things that I hadn’t before. I was thinking for myself and it was incredible. While I was often full of an unexplainable melancholia, I knew I loved life and the people in it. It was this time in my life that my body began to betray me. My joints worked right, but my brain didn’t. Something awful started to grow inside of me. I couldn’t shake this feeling that the loneliness I felt would never go away, and worse yet, I didn’t have anyone to talk to about it.


Over spring break my sophomore year, my mom read my diary. While I was (and still am) furious with my mother for violating something sacred, it opened up a dialogue we had never had before. I wish I could say that this was the point when my parents realized how seriously my thoughts of sadness and self destruction were. Sadly, I was able to convince them that the things I’d written about drugs, suicide, and sex were meaningless. I continued to hide my darkness while self-medicating. Although I felt that my thoughts were written clearly on my face, my family and friends had no idea I was struggling. My 5'11" frame that once was able to hike for miles withered to a malnourished, 120 pound walking skeleton.


My major depression, anxiety, BDD and, most specifically OCD, had taken over my life in multiple ways -- my obsessions often shifting between counting calories, skin picking, planning my suicide, paranoia about my family being attacked by ISIS, relationships, pulling my split ends out (until i am just pulling clumps of hair out!), watching every episode of dateline possible (haha yes.... I did this..), etc., picking my skin raw. I went from picking clogged pores a little bit to creating huge and oozing sores and crusty ass scabs on my face, arms, legs, scalp, butt, inside my nose and nipples. INSIDE MY NOSE AND NIPPLES!!!!! sexy!! As if having a mental illness doesn't make you feel enough shame! Picking hurt but also felt damn good... so good that I would sit in front my mirror and not be able to stop.


A few days before my suicide date, I was picking some old bug bites on my legs. They were pretty infected and gross. Huge scabs that would bleed down my legs and through my leggings. At this time I was mentally prepared to die because I was already dead. I did the classic things: spending all my money, subtly making amends, checking "no suicidal thoughts" during my psychiatrist appointments, the whole nine yards -- all while picking my damn five scabs on my right leg. Between the night of December 26th-27th, i woke up in pain. I threw back my sheets to find that my legs were HUGE. I tried to get out of bed but my legs gave out. I could feel fluid traveling up and down my swollen legs pulsing and aching. I had an extreme infection, so extreme that I was crippled for about two weeks and almost died so they had to pump me full of super powered antibiotics in a bunch of IVS.


I wish I could tell you that after this I realized suicide was a stupid idea. But no -- instead I fell into an even deeper depression and felt like a failure for not killing myself. I hadn't planned to live any day past the 27th for fucks sake. I was devastated that I failed. I didn't expect to have to survive in 2016 and I wasn't mentally prepared. I became catatonic -- the next few months were a blur: sleeping all day, barely leaving the house unless I was going to get adderall (ugh college.) Slowly, I was able to get out of my bed.


My depression wasn’t poetic. It was all ugliness. It was not being able to shower. It was only being able to eat a snickers bar a day because I couldn’t choke any food down. It was my mom washing my hair in the sink and brushing my teeth. My parents put me in treatment. I wish I could say it was easy and went well, but it didn’t. Even for a white, upper middle class young woman who can afford treatment, the mental health care system is difficult to navigate. I had a hard time finding the right medications and couldn’t find the right therapy. It is trial and error.


Discussing my depression and mental illness is terrifying for me. I hate seeming vulnerable and I hate being labeled. I have lost friends due to lack of understanding. I get how it can scare people away. Talking about the things in my head saved my life. And after going through this, part of me wants to talk about it. I want to shout from the rooftops that I’ve survived something so painful I felt it deep in the marrow of my bones. I wake up some mornings and can’t believe I made it out. Depression is more than being sad. It’s hell. But the next time I go I’ll be prepared. For a long time, I felt like a criminal for feeling so intensely. I would be lying if I said my self-hate was gone. I often wonder how other people are making it through life, how they cope with the things that hurt. I feel like everyone got the rulebook but me. I worry I am awful; that I’m heartless. I am scared these things are true.


A few months ago at my last physical, my doctor told me that I was medically cleared of major depression. It’s true; things are different. She was no longer looking at me like I was a martyr without a cause. But I remember feeling for pulses in case none of it was real. Looking down at my wrist, I saw them pumping, the veins under my skin insisting that I’m alive. And I realized that since I am alive, I must embrace the future. I know I am not going to wake up one day and find that my mental illnesses are gone for good. Right now I am stable. But I feel it lurking inside me waiting for a chance to bite -- healthy to sick. Healthy to sick. That scares me more than anything else about my future. I know that I must be gentle with myself and practice self-care. But self-care is both being gentle with and challenging oneself. No more ripping myself apart, telling myself I’m worthless, or thinking of suicide as a solution when I feel my life is out of control. I deserve life and my health comes first.


In the future, I hope to have a greater degree of inner peace than I do now. I hope I can eat more vegetables and stop (or at least slow) my candy and alcohol intake. I hope the constant bounce of my leg will slow because I’ve reached a level of comfort within myself. I want to discover new parts of my personality. I hope to stop looking for validation in the wrong places. While I have some images of clarity, I can’t help but imagine the next few years of my life as a foggy pit, with me standing at the edge. Any second now, I’m getting shoved in. Luckily, I am my own light. Though I have done many shameful things, I am not ashamed of who I am. I am not ashamed of who I am because I know who I am. I have tried to rip myself open and expose everything inside - accepting my weaknesses and strengths - not trying to be anyone else. I am in equal proportions as in control of my life right now as out of control. I frequently try to compensate for fear of the unknown. The change that is happening right now is uncomfortable, but I know that I should embrace it fully. I am stepping forward into growth and the future. Bit by bit, I feel myself becoming whole.
I so love this line you wrote: "I must be gentle with myself and practice self-care. But self-care is both being gentle with and challenging oneself."     Its really beautiful.  Thank you.

Been dealing with depression/ anxiety/ OCD and insomnia. As odd as it is, I'm glad to see another skin picker, especially the face. I still tend to focus on my face, and pick at any imperfection I see. 
[deleted]
Honestly I don't see it. You look like you were popular in school. Just because I know people don't usually have the energy to take a picture of themselves depressed like that unless it's for attention.
Thank you so much!!!! I am so happy that resonated with you!! It's so true!! And so often I think it's so easy to forget that balance :) 
meds helped me yes. I will also be on them forever. But it took me over a year to find the right combination, and even then they don't fix everything. It is also the struggle of finding the right therapists and doctors, etc.
damn what a combo!!! and NO i totally get it. the face is a terrible spot to pick (not only painful -- but so hard to hide! its like "HEY HERE ARE ALL MY PROBLEMS ON MY FACE LETS TALK ABOUT IT!"
 when you really dont want too haha). sending you the best vibes. hope you feel better soon. do you ever go over to the csp forum?
AHHHH thank you so much.

 I so appreciate this comment. it makes my heart grow three sizes grinch style haha!!!! i'm so fucking honored that you resonated/connected with it. that means more than you know. i am sending you the best vibes and energy and hope that you are doing well (especially right now during the holidays!!)
It's all for attention! You got me! That's why I torture myself!
Ahhh this post makes me so frustrated though. Mental illness doesn't have a "look". I wouldn't wish the things I go through on ANYONE. It fucking sucks. I wasn't popular (not that it would matter if I was). Depression and mental illness doesn't give a FUCK if you have zero friends or one hundred. And yeah I take pictures because I scare myself. 
[deleted]
I've been doing well with my treatment,but still have some habits that I can't kick (picking being the main one) picking of the face, ears, scalp and legs. 
 I've worked with a therapist over two years, and have been doing better everyday. 
 Sending you some awesome vibes too. I've never gone over to the csp forums, but I'll check it out.
Well said charlie... mental illness doesn't give a fuck about your life, it's not about your life. 

If you win the lottery who is creating the happiness? It's still you... If it's inside of you, then you were the sole creator of it. In response to the outside event, yes, but it's created by you! Joy and pain are things that are inside of you. 

If you have pain inside of you then it's going to come out in some way. It must! Pain is a thing that attaches itself to other things. If you have pain, you may feel ugly when you're not, depressed when your life is going well "on paper". The inside is more important than the outside. (I don't mean to imply that the problems are not "real", tho.)

Love always wins at the end of the day, but evil will try, even if it's attempts "look" silly. Evil doesn't care how it looks, as long as it works. 

T4blespoon your way of thinking is like this: "I can't believe that a feather falls at the same speed as a rock... so they must not fall at the same speed." You're rejecting reality because it doesn't fit what you know about life. How about next time something doesn't fit what you know about life, you try rejecting what you know about life instead, and learn something new? Try to investigate it, try to understand it. I don't blame you, no one teaches about this stuff in school. But I assure you, OP is not lying. Do you do this to yourself too? When you feel bad do you tend to put yourself down? Or maybe you bury your feelings inside. Maybe you sometimes feel bad but don't even know. (Just trying to be of help here.) 
THIS.  I'm 26, have always shown aptitude in many areas of study, have always been good-looking enough to be able to "get the girl", am athletic, a talented musician... and everyone has always told me that I seem so relaxed all the time.  I used to not understand why I was depressed, but I get it now.  With my parents always telling me I "had it made", that everything in my life was perfect, I never once confronted even the smallest of emotional problems because I truly believed I didn't have any.  That stuff just builds up and weighs you down.  It quite literally *depresses* your brain and mind.  Now, I have to deal with depression while similtaneously try to change all those bad habits.  It's exhausting.  
there are definite risks which are very scary! completely understandable to be worried about. personally im on 400mg effexor, 350mg wellbutrin and 72mg concerta. There are tons of side effects i've experienced (sweating! migraines! shaking! how fun!) as well as intense sickness i feel if i miss a day (almost as if my brain is being electrocuted haha coupled with chills and nausea). Some pills you also can't be on if you are a woman planning to have a baby which is something to think about in the future. I'm very anti pills, but if you know you need them to function and to get yourself to a place where you can get out of bed, it's worth it. Definitely explore other avenues of healing while on meds, but take it day by day and don't push yourself too much
I got off my meds for this reason.  I did it recklessly and could've caused way more harm than good, but I'm in a better place now being off them.  From a neurological perspective, ssri's, snri's, etc. have the potential to be very dangerous.  If you monitor your body, then you should be fine, though.  I had too many physical side-effects to just ignore all the red flags, but my grandma is 88 and has been on Prozac for over 25 years.  Everyone is different.
right on!!! yeah picking sucks. well definitely check it out -- there are some great tips. if you ever want to compare coping techniques to avoid picking, feel free to message me. id love to share some and learn some :) 
thank you. thank you. thank YOU SO MUCH! omg i could literally kiss you haha. thank you. so beautifully articulated too!!!!! 
awww fuck :( im sorry. that is so shitty. yeah i think there is so much about mental illness that people think is black and white. which is frustrating cause its so not at all. all types of people suffer in all sorts of different ways (celebrities, the homeless, addicts, moms and dads, kids, religious people, etc.) and thats what makes treatment so fucking hard!!!! wishing you the best. 
I'm really glad it made you feel better! :D I hope you can keep posting, thanks for sharing your story. It's curious (also heartbreaking yet inspirational) to see what you went through, I didn't know much about skin picking until today, so thanks for teaching people about that. Also I really like the way you write. You seem like a cool person! :D

Congratulations and what a great cause. Maybe you could check out BoF's Future Voice next year (I'm not super familiar with it but seems like something they would be open to). 
Thank you so much!! P.s. thanks for the insight into BoF Future Voice, I hadn't heard of this but will definitely give it a go next year! 
My route to suicide transpired over the course of roughly five years, so I suppose this letter will be as much a story as anything. It is, in essence, that of Tantalus, of Sisyphus, of Pandora, and Ulysses. Or, if you prefer, the ramblings of a mentally ill classics nerd. Your choice.
    I was sober; the thought was sobering. In my left hand I held my goals, my dreams. I am, to my core, compelled to be a person of importance. I want my life to echo, like ripples on still water from a fallen, polished stone. I want so much from this life and from myself. Yet in my right hand I held facts closer to present circumstance. My depression has robbed me of emotion, of direction, of motivation, of vitality itself. In that hand I held a great weight of realization: I will always have to expend one-hundred times the energy to accomplish one tenth the work. What a crystalline recognition! I am destined to let myself down. To always look around dissatisfied with my circumstance. To always want, but never receive. Call me Tantalus; I may never reach that which I require. In a word, hopelessness.
    Being insufficient is not an unknown belief to me. I have had such thoughts time and time again over the last five years. They, ultimately, were the driving force behind my transition home to the Sheppard Pratt Mental Hospital. I admitted I needed help. I sought help. I got help. Medicine. Therapy. Exercise. Socialization. I lived the life of a proactive person, bent on recovery. By this time I was on my fourth battery of medications, each time preceded by a triage of doctors and a handful of optimistic well-wishes. Four times I had endured the pain of seeking help, trying new medications, weening off failed medication attempts, starting anew, waiting for the new meds to work (weeks and weeks counted by the minute). Each time I rolled a boulder of well-being up the steep hill to recovery, and ultimately back to the beginning the boulder rolled. Four times over and yet again I tried to rise. Thus was spent my time as an inpatient at Sheppard Pratt. Months passed and nothing was better. Again fell failure. Call my Sisyphus; I will always struggle, I will never succeed.
    I opened a car door that was not a door, but rather a box. Out from the exhaust pipes forward marched all that was evil in my world. My blood ran rampant with overdose. My liver frantically fought a doomed battle. The hoses I had attached to the exhaust pipes smiled at me from inside the car, my airtight coffin, and steadily I was entombed. I had let loose all my demons, given them power over me, made them manifest in this world. Between the alcohol, the overdose, and carbon monoxide poisoning, my death was made certain. Time remained the only factor. Call me Pandora; I had unleashed madness into my world. In a word, chaos.
    But at the bottom of Pandora’s box remained hope. I hyperventilated and had the most viscous panic attack I’ve ever suffered. Adrenaline brought brief lucidity. Suddenly struck by terror unimaginable, I called 911. I blacked out before I could so much as give the operator my name. But my phone, location services enabled, remained on, held loosely in my limp right hand. In a word, hope.
    I woke up in the emergency room, hooked up to every imaginable machine, my own personal suicide sitter, her eyes never leaving mine. We sat there, silently, in opia, as my clouded mind wrestled to understand where I was and how I had gotten there. My stomach had been pumped; my throat raged in protest. My entire body ached. It took all of my energy to simply sit up in my gurney. They had me drink a liter of charcoal sludge. I don’t recommend it. My family was there. Each of their fallen tears brought me back closer to reality and to the gravity of what I had attempted. I was numb for a few days. There was much to process.
    The first emotion that I regained was an overwhelming sensation of relief, followed by unabashed gratitude. I have been given a second chance. I am working hard on my recovery- harder than I have ever worked before. I am on new medications, and they are working incredibly well. I am currently in outpatient therapy, where I work daily on bettering myself and overcoming my mental disorder. I have come to appreciate that I am not disabled, but rather differently abled. I am thankful daily that I was found and brought back into this world. I am full of hope. And words! I am writing again- even poetry! Truly, I am come again to life.
    It has been a long journey of many years, and I have been blown far from home. Call me Ulysses, for I will make it back to where I need to be, no matter how long it takes. In a word, determination.
I will not hide from my actions. Though the negative stigmas associated with mental illness may drive many people away, I feel obligated to speak out. Someone, somewhere, is suffering as acutely as I did on that day. I’m here, screaming from a mountaintop, praying that they hear me and know that they are understood. I want to tell that person that mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. That being open and honest about your mental health doesn’t make you insane, but rather brings you to balance. It’s time to address our nation’s unspoken mental health crisis. I’ll start.
I'll never forget those feelings of lack of self worth as I moved through my day to day life. "You're just a kid, kids are cruel" is what I would hear when I would ask for help. It didn't matter. At 13 I felt like I had the weight of the world on my shoulders. I was too scared to reach out to my parents because I didn't want them to think less of me. Little did I know they were waiting for me to reach out. That one night when I asked my dad for the keys to the shed to get the ladder so I could try to jump off the roof of the house he followed me and stopped me before I could. It didn't matter I said. I'd find another way. Little did I know I wouldn't be given the option of another way. Weeks of inpatient therapy later and different batches of meds and I returned to school to face the same people who had given me that feeling of no self-worth. The hardest part wasn't facing the people who had caused this. I was finally beginning to come to terms with it after months, but I was still scared to talk to my peers because of the stigma of being the "crazy" kid in school. Yes people will joke about mental illness and I've learned to sometimes joke along, but it isn't enough. It needs to be spoken about at the highest level. About why we are facing this epidemic, and what we can do to change it. Until then, I'll fight for my voice to be heard about why I'm glad I was given that second chance. Why I'm glad I wasn't just another statistic.
Beautiful words. Wish I could give more than one upvote.  
You've convinced me.   There is a glimpse of hypomanic elation in Greek Lyric poetry.

Suggest reading the Hindu Epics.   Less grandiose and the millions of subplots lead...  loopty loops.

I'm glad you made it

I thought I should post this in case it could help anybody out there living with depression, and I sort of wanted to see if anybody has had a similar experience. 

I've been depressed for a long time- almost all of my adolescent life. (I'm turning 20 soon). I've also always struggled with being social and having anxiety. 

I went on a long overseas vacation back in July, and I told myself when I got back to the US I wouldn't go on living how I was. Well, I eventually fell into the same pattern of sleep, work, be sad. I'd spent nights researching depression and listening to TED talks, getting inspired, etc. Making lists of things I wanted to change, how I should be thinking. Writing in my journal. My family was concerned about me because my depression brought everybody down. I had many intense conversations with them about being healthy and trying to create a better way for me to exist. After about 3 months of living like this, in the past two weeks or so, something has clicked. It's like I woke up one morning and my depression was gone. I'm no longer plagued and bombarded with negative thoughts about myself and my life. It used to be hard to sit in silence before, because my thoughts were so negative and hard to control. I'm not even as afraid of people as I used to be. I feel like a new person. I've never felt this way; I feel normal  I know that I'll always be more a little more depressed than the next guy because that's who I am, but for the most part, right now, I am not depressed. I can wake up now, and spend my day productively. I couldn't get out of bed a couple weeks ago. 

 Part of my theory is that I've been reading about overcoming depression for so long, made so many lists and struggled so much, had so many family interventions that my subconscious might have finally absorbed everything and this is the result. Another big change I've made is that I've been exercising almost every day. I go on the elliptical for 25-40 minutes each day, and do a sequence of ab exercises and lunges if I have the time. It makes me feel really good, and more confident. I used to drag myself into the gym, but now, going on the elliptical and listening to fun dance music is a quality part of my "me-time". 

I've been making healthier choices on how I spend my time and what I eat. I look people in the eye when I talk to them, and I'm not ashamed of myself. 

This is getting kind of long. 
All I'm saying is, if you're struggling with depression, it's like being in big dark bubble. I remember trying to be fake happy and it doesn't work. Either does forcing positive thoughts. But it is a start. It'll sink in eventually. Exercise is key, I think that's what has helped me the most. 


I second this. I still have depressive days sometimes but there was a moment when I had an epiphany when I got out of depression for a few days for the first time. It was as if my eyesight was literally brighter and my responses were better and I was more emotive.

Just a reminder to those that believe the world is dark and cold. It can get warmer again. Exercise and keep doing it whenever you can, force yourself to be outside for hours each week, especially in sunny times, try taking vitamin pills or buy one of those "UV light" thingies you can have in your room -- long term it really matters to your mental state
wow man i'm crying i'm so happy for you! wow. best wishes, i sincerely hope that this lasts for you. that it's long term and brings you joy and meaning. damn. now i'm snotty. ugh okay it just was a bit overwhelming to see someone have a positive transition i hope i get there with ya one day! lol i've been thinking about exercising to see if it works and because of your story i might just commit to that. thanks for sharing!! sincerely best wishes
While all those things do help, I want to caution you. I, too, felt like I woke up one day and my depression was gone. I went through my early 20s right as rain, but when I hit 24, the switch flipped again. Depression can be cyclical. Keep your healthy habits up, they will definitely help keep the depression away, but sometimes it does come back. 
Cool. This post means a lot to me because I feel like I do all the things you're supposed to do and it seems all redundant. But now I know that there is a means to an end.

Thanks for the push to keep working everyday towards a better more positive me. 
Been suffering with it most of my life.

Well, actually a nurse practitioner. Prescribed me 10 mg of Lexipro. It makes me emotionally numb somewhat a few hours after taking it. Today I felt really down, but I know starting meds can do that to you the first time taking them.

The whole process was really easy and I would recommend everyone else to see a doctor instead of waiting until they are 29 like I did.
Not to burst your bubble but it's quite likely you are experiencing a placebo/nocebo effect.  SSRIs like Lexapro do not work immediately and typically take 4-6 weeks before one receives the full benefits.  If your mood is truly cycling as rapidly as you describe, depression may not be an accurate diagnosis.  You might consider asking your PCP for a referral to a psychiatrist. A specialist is probably called for,  especially given the longitudinal course of the symptoms you've got.   Good luck, keep up the good work,  its not easy asking for help and consider seeing a therapist as well.  It's pretty well established that meds combined talk therapy lead to the best outcomes.

29, you're doing well.  Im 41 and still cant bring myself to go, instead I just isolate myself and self medicate.  Congrats, its a big step not everyone can make.
I actually am just now getting off 10mg Lexapro after being on it for about 6 weeks. I was given it because I was having really bad flare ups of anxiety with mild depression.  It made me emotionally numb, more depressed, and incredibly tired all the time. I wasn't able to enjoy anything anymore. The sexual side effects were absolutely killer. My doctor took me off of it (cold turkey so I'm having mild withdrawal symptoms) and switched me to Adderall (when I need it) and Lamictal to help balance me out. 

Give it a few weeks and see if you begin to improve. If not, talk to your doctor about switching. Sometimes it can take a while for the med to start working. Maybe a different class of medication might work better for you if this one is causing you so many problems.
"It may take 1 to 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of escitalopram." Says in your first link.  
The side-effects start immediately, and it's normal for the moods to start changing before the full benefit begins.

Pharma companies are pushing those drugs, and they can be definitely toxic. Check this out to see how great, ethical and concerned about well-being of their patients those companies are: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_329

This is not a stand-alone case, it's a pattern. Another link just in case: http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/07/harvard_scientists_disciplined.html

Of course they want to push drugs before therapy, profits are enormous.
A "toxic drug"?  In other words, a poisonous medication?
Antidepressants (and a great many other medications) are over-prescribed. On that there is wide agreement.

But what is this toxic drug that is being used to poison youth?
>doctors were still giving the drug citalopram to treat depression in young people, despite official guidance not to do this.

>“Citalopram has a known toxicity **in overdose** and there were warnings given about it in 2011,” she said.

Emphasis mine. In general the article, and the black box warning discussion, aren't anything new and happen with many meds. And it's no surprise that while often a me dis just described, it can be a PITA to find the right one.

If someone asked me, I would reply that I'm more concerned about young patient's ability to properly monitor themselves for and correctly attribute side effects to the medication than about the side effects. Nearly side effect free Prozac could mean all sorts of things. 
Terrifying.
> But what is this toxic drug that is being used to poison youth?

Well, despite the somewhat clickbaity title. Toxic in this sense, means it can dull senses and it takes a toll on the liver and/ or kidneys. 
Prozac isn't side-effect free, if it was for you than congratulations on being lucky. I got my first real panic attach where I was just lying on a couch unable to move and afraid as fuck when I was prescribed it. I'm not an anomaly either.
Toxic doesn't mean what you think it means.

By your description, alcohol is toxic, along with a great many other medications.

> and it takes a toll on the liver and/ or kidneys.

And that is why there is regular monitoring of this as well as heart-rate. 
Nah, I never got either of these meds, had other "fun" experiences instead...
> alcohol is toxic

[It is.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol#Toxicity)
> And that is why there is regular monitoring of this as well as heart-rate.

...Your point being? You do realize the liver is a much more fragile organ than say for example the heart. What good does monitoring if unnecessary amounts of medication is already put in place? You can monitor all you want, but nobody is going to do anything about that anyway. 
> Unnecessarily armounts

The post here implies the med is unsafe. 

It is only unsafe if overdosed, as the actual article says. 

You can't stop people from poisoning themselves with water, do you stop giving water? That's the logic that's at work here. 

Under normal use, no damage will occur that won't usually be found by blood tests. So my point is that you know it can affect the organs, and that yes, monitoring will do good. Because the kidneys won't fail just like that one day.
> The post here implies the med is unsafe.

Implying meds are unsafe is disingenuous and uninformative, but not understanding that all meds that have a working effect, also have side effects should always be kept in mind.


> It is only unsafe if overdosed, as the actual article says.


First off, a lot of people get enough meds prescribed to actually damage their liver when such doses are used daily for several years.


> You can't stop people from poisoning themselves with water, do you stop giving water? That's the logic that's at work here.


No the logic here, is that meds isn't the most effective way of dealing with mental illness. Yet its the most common way of dealing with it. And for some reason, you seem to defend that. I'm not saying meds are bad, I'm not anti-meds in any way. The problem comes with the fact that people are overdosing on meds, and people are dying of liver and kidney problems, after they've survived ODs. Your rhetoric is completely neglecting the fact that mental illness isn't easily solved by meds, its like you're completely ignoring the self-harm, and suicidal tendencies of a lot of people taking these meds to begin with.


> Under normal use, no damage will occur that won't usually be found by blood tests. So my point is that you know it can affect the organs, and that yes, monitoring will do good. Because the kidneys won't fail just like that one day.


By that logic, mental health shouldn't even be an issue, because we have meds, right?
> Your rhetoric is completely neglecting the fact that mental illness isn't easily solved by meds, its like you're completely ignoring the self-harm, and suicidal tendencies of a lot of people taking these meds to begin with.

I happen to be part of the demographic, you tell me I'm basically ignoring myself here.

> First off, a lot of people get enough meds prescribed to actually damage their liver when such doses are used daily for several years

Yes, and as you said in the next paragraph, a lot of these people happen to be at an elevated risk of self harm. A doctor will balance that against possible damage from meds. I rather not be dead by suicide than not risk my organs.

I never said meds were the most effective way, or referred to therapy. My rhetoric wants to qualify the "toxic drug" headline.
> A doctor will balance that against possible damage from meds.

No they won't, that's up to a psychiatrist, not a doctor. Doctors doesn't have physiological training in their educational program in most countries.


edit: 

>  I rather not be dead by suicide than not risk my organs.


if you're suicidal and meds are working for you, congrants, but that's extremely rare.
But psychiatrists are doctors?
> But psychiatrists are doctors?

Well, over here, not exactly. They can prescribe medication or order treatment methods, but that's pretty much it. Calling them a doctor would kind of be like calling a car mechanic an engineer. 

Oh, look, another Poor Sad Millionaire^TM story.  I sure am glad this story exists.  Now I can be told that I shouldn't feel like shit any more, since this famous and popular millionaire also has a condition I have.  Never you mind that Bruce Fucking Springsteen has vastly more access to treatment, is unfathomably more financially secure than me, and has several more concrete things to feel confident/secure/happy/not shitty about  than I do (which is to say, *any at all*, let alone being Bruce Fucking Springsteen).

Or maybe this is supposed to "raise awareness."  Okay.  I'm pretty sure you could safely presume everyone already knows about depression, so what is this supposed to "raise awareness" *of*?  I struggle to find any fucks to give about Bruce Springsteen's depression, since he's doing great by any measure and I'm doing crappy by any measure.

And I *like* Bruce Springsteen.

Edit: Corrected a spelling of "Springstein" to his actual fucking name, and corrected "unfashionably" to "unfathomably."  I are can spells good!
Unfortunately there are still plenty of people that don't understand how common depression and similar mental health conditions are. Having a figure like Bruce open up about this holds tremendous value in getting those folks to better understand and accept their own feelings, and maybe even seek treatment. I hope you have a good day!
I think it's cute that you have the impression that vast resources and "the best treatment" so dramatically alter the course of the illness. I've had access to the best specialists in the world and it didn't seem to change how I was "partially resistant" and enigmatic to the physicians. I think you need to seriously check the metrics by which you determine success. You may think Springsteen is "doing great by any measure" but if he is not doing great by his own measure and expresses that, you have no place to doubt his opinion. One of the key feautures of depression is that one could seemingly have everything going for him/her, but if he/she is constantly feeling guilt, lack of energy, insomnia etc... he/she may still be depressed. It is bizzare to me that you do not understand that depression is not a function of material wealth and public success and you focus on the external attributes of Springsteen. I'm not a huge Springsteen fan, but I respect his openness. It is often the perception that "celebs have everything" which drives them into isolation in regards to their mental health issues. If more celebs were honest about their struggles, the general population might have a better understanding of the frequency of mental health issues and they won't be so stigmatized. You don't have to give a fuck about his depression, but that doesn't make it any less real or painful.
I dunno man, I like these kinds of stories. It helps remind me there's not somethings fundamentally wrong with me; I have an illness, just like anyone else can get. Even rich, sexy, talented rock stars. Or hilarious, deeply loved, actors like Robin Williams. 
I said nothing about depression itself, but rather these types of *articles*.  Whatever their intended purpose, these articles come across as either soliciting sympathy for someone who has it pretty damn good (certainly better than me or anyone else here) or a hamfistedly inept attempt at "it gets better."

I'm all out of fucks to give for the latest Poor Sad Millionaire^TM because I also have depression and, unlike Springsteen, I am not a famous and popular millionaire.  Rather, I have depression and am a poor, friendless loser with no job and only a couple months of savings left before I don't even have the option of choosing suicide over a lifetime of misery that only gets worse (because then my options will be "die of starvation and/or exposure over *here*" vs. "starvation and/or exposure over *there*").  Springsteen has it better than me in every way he could, so I don't exactly feel sorry for him.

As for the "it gets better" angle, go over to /r/depression or /r/suicidewatch and tell those folks "it gets better."  Hell, go to /r/sanctionedsuicide and start posting "it gets better" messages if you want to hear what those other two subs really think.
There are two things these kind of stories can say:

1. I should feel sorry for someone who has it better than me in every conceivable way, just because they are also depressed; or 

2. I'm an asshole for feeling like shit because someone who has it better than me in every conceivable way is also depressed.

In the case of number 1, I'm out of fucks to give, because Springsteen is beloved by millions and *worth* millions, while I am a friendless loser with no job and am bleeding through my savings.  Tell a starving person how bummed you are that you had to throw out those leftovers because you didn't eat them in three days; that's what option one is telling me.

In the case of number 2, reading "success stories" of people with depression, or the latest Poor Sad Millionaire's^TM claim to have depression but "it's okay for *you* because *I'm* rich," is just a pointless bootstrap anecdote.  Bruce Springsteen is rich, famous, and popular.  I am none of those and never *will* be any of those.  I am also not Bruce Fucking Springsteen, and whatever his deal with depression is or was *therefore neither is, was, has been, or will be mine*.  If this article is going for option 2, it's just more "it gets better" crap, which tells me all I need to know about how and why it is irrelevant and worthless.

Edit: Corrected one instance of "Bruce Spingsteeb" with, you know, the guy's actual fucking name.  Me am smart!  S-A-M-R-T!
[deleted]
Neither of your points make any sense. You sound like the kind of person who wants everyone to be miserable just because you are. 

The only thing these stories say is "sometimes people who seem fine are not" which benefits us all.

And even "Even millionaires can be depressed. Mental illness doesn't care who you are. You can't snap out of it or just think about the good things"
**ONCE A-FUCKING-GAIN,** I have said nothing about depression itself, **ONLY** these Poor Sad Millionaire^TM articles.  I have zero fucks to give about someone who has *one* problem I have, when I have not only that problem but *several more besides*.  Springsteen has depression and so do I?  Whoop-de-shit; Springsteen is depressed and rich while I'm depressed and poor.  Springsteen is depressed and beloved by legions of fans while I am depressed and friendless.  Springsteen is depressed and a renowned performer and songwriter while I am depressed and such a shitty communicator that I can't get across the point that **I AM SAYING NOTHING ABOUT DEPRESSION, BUT ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY THESE SHITTY-ASS ARTICLES**.  Fuck, I'm narrowing it even more: I'm talking about *my reaction* to these shitty-ass articles because of *my circumstances*.   You could not get farther from criticizing, attacking, misunderstanding, or *saying anything at goddamn all* about depression than that.
Okay

Edit: In response to your edit ... actually, no, I've repeated myself multiple times in this thread alone on this point.  This is a standard Poor Sad Millionaire^TM story meant to make the reader feel sorry for Bruce Springsteen, which, fine.  Some people can feel sorry for Bruce Springsteen, as is their right.  I don't, because I've got all his problems and more.  I'm done repeating myself on this bullshit.  
The purpose of the article is to provide insight into an Artist's^TM life and discuss what drives his art. The idea that the article and others like it have some nefarious purpose to make you feel bad about yourself is not true and is just your depression talking. 

There is nothing in this article that says you should feel bad about yourself or feel bad for Springsteen. Again, it's the depression making you think everything is about you. 

Not everyone's struggle is of the same magnitude; someone who was abused as a child objectively struggles more than I do. That doesn't make my depression any less real or less difficult for me. Maybe your struggles are much deeper than his since his life is eased by wealth. That doesn't make depression any less real to him. 
Hello, I'm a 21 year old male.

Whenever I am not studying, working or exercising I get extremely restless and anxious. I feel as if I'm not trying hard enough, wasting my time and feel guilty about it. It's hard to explain but I get a really heavy, irritating feeling in my chest.

If I'm not doing something to 'better' myself I just feel really bad. It's not like I'm in a bad position either. I get all A's at University and am in good shape. I've actually been told by multiple people (including my girlfriend) that I'm a lot of pressure to be around because of how hard I work and what I achieve. People say they always feel behind me. I don't like people thinking like that.

It's also gotten to the point where I'm constantly tired and feel worn out. but as soon as I try to rest I can't. Also have started having trouble falling asleep because it's like my brain is always really active, reviewing vocabulary for languages I'm learning, or reciting formulas or trying to figure out a programming problem I'm working on.

Is there anything I can do by myself to try and relax?
> Also have started having trouble falling asleep because it's like my brain is always really active, 

This is a big problem for me.  What works for me is mindfulness exercises or adult coloring books, because I have feelings/worries I haven't processed yet, that I end up processing at the most inoportune times.
Most people need to force themselves to be productive. You're going to have to force yourself to have fun and relax. It sounds weird, but you have to force yourself to do these things that make you feel anxious and try to change your mindset about them. Whenever you have the feeling that you should be doing something productive just tell yourself that there's no need, you are up to day and it will be better for you to relax and unwind. 

I have this problem, but in my case it is "justified", in that I am more lazy and irresponsible than you, so it should be easier for you.
You are definitely not alone! It's tough to not feel guilty. What works for me when I actually take the time to do it, is tell myself I deserve it. I'm watching tv right now? Yes. I deserve it. You're still working because you're bettering yourself. You're working on self care. To do all the things you feel you NEED to do, self care will help you do it with a recharged mind.

Also, write or think about some things that you DID do. Ok, today I woke up, made a good breakfast, worked out, I showered, I did some laundry. I mean, look at all the little things you constantly do that aren't "work" but are great things.
Not popular advice on mental health, but go smoke some pot unless you have drug tests coming up (avg 30 day detox). Sounds like youre in college.

Think of those moments where youre not doing much as "cracking down on your mental health." By relaxing occassionally you will make yourself more efficient when its time to be productive. The flight of ideas will just keep you walking on eggshells and bottling up those stressors will end badly.

I know its not as easy as "turn it off." Thats why i recommend trying cannabis. Thats one of the main benefits of it. Also you may rest easier. Do some researcg, Talk to your gf about it, etc.

Otherwise, a therapist can be helpful. Even if youre not mentally ill
Were your guardian\parents always on you as a child?
You can be in charge of how you feel! Check out Neurofeedback, Neural Empowerment and/or consciousness hacking! It worked and continues to work for me! I used to wake up everyday thinking that I should just kill myself... Now everything has changed!
mindfulness or guided meditation could be helpful. 
You could try Story-focues videogames where you still have a sense of purpose while relaxing 
I felt like this too and was put on a mood stabilizer. It helps a bit but sometimes I'm up until 4am doing stuff.
Seriously I recommend smoking weed. If ur situation doesn't allow of that , I recommend kratom (mix it with chocolate milk) or kava . You might also look into phenibut.
Have you tried easing yourself into gradually longer periods of inactivity/rest? Like, today you do something mindless and mundane for 5 minutes, tomorrow the same, and when the anxiety subsides for the total of those 5 minutes you up the time. 
Consider the fact that managing your mental health is in fact a form of bettering yourself. Keep that context in your mind. Then. I strongly suggest some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and meditation. I recognize something of myself in your need to do and achieve and I think that these two things will provide a framework and some sense of challenge and accomplishment while helping you pursue balanced mental health.
I was like OP then decided that I wanted to be able to chill and relax.  

Be mindful of where you draw your line.  I always had to be up and doing stuff, and once I slowed down my depression reared it's head.   Turns out that I was essentially manic.  

I'm working on getting my meds sorted so I can be level and feel good enough to be active again.  Not saying this is your problem, but it wouldn't hurt to just discuss it with a counselor or professional before you make any monumental life changing decisions.
Yeah I try to make myself sit down and read or watch tv or something. But even then I end up reading a book on computer science or something or watching a tv show in another language to practice my language skills, haha.
Yeah, I always feel that if I relaxed and 'recharged my mind' I'd be able to perform better. That's a good way to think about it, and including all the little things too.
I agree and disagree.  I smoke weed daily and have for over half of my life.  I wish I'd learned to do it all without this crutch.  All these years later, I feel my life would be much different.  That feeling OP has is longing, that fire in his chest is drive.  Almost nobody's just happy with their lives that I've seen.  Most are trying to do better and improve.  OP might be ahead now but not forever.  I say OP should keep rocketing forward but throw the same enthusiasm into rest, play and relaxation where necessary to keep going.  I chose drugs to control it and did ok but I wish I hadn't.  
Hmmm, I was labelled gifted and talented by my education system and I felt like a lot was expected of me as a child. Maybe that has something to do with it.
I'll give it a gander, thanks!
I've tried this but the same feeling I get when I try to relax comes up and totally throws me off.

Well done.  Worth reading. Thank you.
Great post, I appreciate the examples given. 

This is amazing. I have no experience with heart surgery but I'm going to pick it up and start reading it right away. Congratulations man, I'm really sorry it happened but this is hugely inspirational. Hope you're feeling better ✌🏻️
Thank you very much! I am great now, life is good!

This is the best TED Talk I have ever seen. Changes my life for an hour whenever I watch it.
I can no longer attend school because I was kicked out of my dorm for 2 self harm incidents- one in October, and one last Tuesday (both of which I reached out for help for). I live 5 hours away from school, so commuting is not an option.  I realize that my focus should now be getting the help I need (which I'm doing), but now my education is permanently over at the school I love. Apparently, self harm is "disturbing the community and uses a considerable amount of resources." Go figure.

Any advice?
Contact a lawyer specializing in disabilities, equal access, and/or education law. This is very likely illegal, and happens all the time. The more people stand up for their rights, the more these schools are going to change these "cover your ass" policies designed to protect schools from lawsuits, over protecting the interests of students. 
That sounds like discrimination against a mental illness. But I am not a lawyer (and you really need one at this point), so you should contact Legal Aid in NY to see if they'll assist you. Just tell them that your school is kicking you out due to a mental illness. 


Here's their contact info and locations (contact whichever one is closest to you, if none of these are, then try finding the Legal Aid office near you):  
www.legal-aid.org/en/las/findus/locations.aspx. (NYC locations)  
www.lasnny.org/contact/  (Northeastern NY)     


If they won't help you, call Disability Advocates in NY and explain the situation to them and see if they'll represent you. They should be willing to help you if Legal Aid won't. www.disabilityadvocates.org 


Best of luck to you!
Wow, stigma at it's finest, I'm pretty  sure that's illegal in some parts of the world.

I recommend doing some research on the mental health laws or "acts" in your country.
I hope your campus has some sort of official advocate for people with disabilities / mental health issues. Regardless, you should start looking up every possible office of the administration and student groups which might be able to assist or advise you. Start phoning them to see what resources you may be able to access in ensuring you are not penalized or denied your education for trying to be your best. You should be commended, not punished, for seeking help for yourself. Your registrar's office should be able to at least tell you if there is any application you can make to an appeals process, or any of that other procedural stuff. But the more you ask around, the better the chances someone can point you toward help. Just keep a line in the discussion between your own mental health and courses of treatment, versus your right to access an education and the way you are being treated by the administration. Hang in there!

Does the school have online courses you can take until you can talk to someone about getting back into the dorms? Also,  if not can you see if you are getting counseling they can let you back in? Take care of your mental heath first if you need to. 
[deleted]
If you're interested, I posted the full story, with the details I thought were relevant here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3wr2t3/new_york_after_seeking_help_for_a_mental_health/
Thank you so much for those resources, I'll definitely try to get a hold of them!
I'm hoping it's illegal in my part of the world (I live in New York).  I'm pretty sure I have a fighting chance if I were to file for discrimination.
>I hope your campus has some sort of official advocate for people with disabilities / mental health issues.

We have the Student Disability Services team, but it's more for giving people academic accommodations like extra time on tests. 
Fortunately, it was just the dorms.  I'm still allowed to continue my studies at the college if I were to commute, but that's not an option for me since I live so far away and I can't afford to live off campus. 

My mental health is my first priority right now, but I know that it's important to eventually finish school. I'm just afraid that it'll be hard to transfer with this on my record, you know?
My school doesn't offer online classes.  
>Most higher education schools are a business.

I guess the fact that I attend a state school distracted me from that idea, but you're 100% right.

>Mybe taking med leave and going back is possible, or have they banned you?

I'm on a medical leave right now, and my intention is to transfer to a program online.  Perhaps through Penn State. I'm still in good academic standing.


They may or may not be able to directly help you here, but call them up anyway - schedule an appointment to meet if you can - and see what kind of advice they can give. They are a friendly source of information and ideas if nothing else!
[deleted]
They are a state school? And you are in New York? I know this system. This is very concerning and absolutely wreaks of discrimination, especially considering you are in good academic standing. Get healthy, but this is not acceptable.
Very true, thanks!
I don't know for certain that it'll be on my transcript, but my e-mail with my eviction letter said that it was for conduct, so it's probably going to show up somewhere.
>They are a state school? And you are in New York?

Yes and yes. I'm at a four-year SUNY school. 
As a transfer student, I know the online thing that gets transferred is your transcript. You housing shouldn't be on your transcript as it has nothing to do with your academics.
Is there a Center for Student Health with psychological services? The campus I'm familiar with has such a service, they also have an early alert system from students with issues (not just academic). They might provide some resources and assist. I know you said you saw a counselor after your first incident. They may not be aware of all the issues? I know you registered with Student Support Services, but offices often do not (and in this case, cannot because of HIPAA) share information.
Which campus are you familiar with, if you don't mind me asking? The one I'm at has a health and counseling center where I was receiving group therapy, but I've never heard of the early alert system. The counselor I saw during my first incident was so taken aback by the warning I got, she almost reacted unprofessionally (one would have thought she'd give me some insight as to what Res Life was thinking, but she just bashed them). 
Sure, I sent you a PM.

Today is a day I’ve been working towards for months. I first released my app, called MoodTools, for Android last year. While I was trying to find some funding to pay for someone to port it to iOS, my friend, who owns an iPhone and had been dealing with depression, committed suicide. I decided to take matters into my own hand and learn how to code it myself. This is the culmination of my hard work, so check it out and let me know what you think! And if you like it, please share it with anyone you think might benefit from it. 

The journey doesn’t end here of course. I will continue to improve and polish MoodTools, so I welcome any feedback you have in the comments. Thank you! 
No question, but I have your app on android. I don't use it very often but I do think its pretty well done. Sometimes it helps and sometimes nothing can help :P Thank you so much for your work! I'm sorry about the loss of your friend.
Hey, I'm going to download this now. Thanks for all your hard work - I'm sure your friend would truly appreciate it, too. :)
Thanks man. I've been using this for a few months now (on Android). It actually helps me a lot. I mostly use the diary to record encounters I have and work through them.
Any plans to release it for Windows Mobile?
This is amazing! thank you and well done.
Just downloaded. Looks great! Thank you so much for this :-)

Unfortunately, I'm poor so I can't afford to donate but I will give a 5-star rating on the Google Play store and let my friends know about it. Keep up the good work.
And if you're too poor to have an iPhone that can handle iOS 8, screw you.

Tip: there are a LOT of poor people with depression that have old phones that can't update beyond 6.1.7.
[deleted]
Thank you, and that's great to hear! I'll be adding more features in the coming months so stay tuned :) 
Yes! There's a tool coming out that will let me easily convert Android apps to windows phones and I look forward to using that as soon as it comes out! My friend with a windows phone bugs me every week about this lol
My deepest apologies about that. iOS 8 had a lot of new features for coding that I used, and making it backwards compatible would have required a lot more time. I wanted to release it as soon as I could, but I'll look into adding it in the future. 
I definitely will be taking the mini apps, modifying / adding new ones, and packaging them for other disorders as well. (Although I want them to remain relatively disorder specific, just to target app store searches). Bipolar disorder in particular would be easy to do! 

And thank you about the psychoeducation part :) I remember a few years ago I knew nothing about mental illness while trying to help a friend and simply reading + learning about it made a HUGE difference! 

This is really valuable. Thanks for the post.
Thanks for this!
Here's a semi-related post I saw a while ago called [100 ways to get through the next 5 minutes](http://lifelineforattemptsurvivors.org/100-ways-to-get-through-the-next-5-minutes/)
This feels like it'll really help! Thank you *so* much. It's what I needed.
Thanks for sharing, I actually did 1-4 today.

This. I went *years* longer without help than I should have because I didn't associate the word "depression" with what I was experiencing. I had the same vague misunderstanding of it as everyone else, even though I was living it.

Also I really liked this quote:

>*Depression is inexplicable because it's such a sharp blow to the senses. It's like nothing else you've ever felt, and it's difficult to believe when it strikes that humanity hasn't found a better way to articulate something so agonizing.*

It's sad. Suicide is a public health crisis, but *nothing* is being done to prevent it. You could even argue that it's illegal to start such an organization. 

All they pretty much do is lock you up and wait for you to pretend to be a happy little sunflower so you're too afraid to seek help ever again. That's *horrible.* If there was a way way to seek help for suicidal people, I believe the suicide rate would be cut in half.
It's easier to blame people who kill themselves, then any other option. Saying that they were selfish, and why didn't they think about the people they left behind is easy.
about 1 suicide every 15 minutes.

So true it´s unbelievable. More men die from suicide than women from domestic violence, yet it´s all day hearing about domestic violence and men suicide is like taboo. 
Hell, suicide in general is like taboo. You bring up any of those feelings and you can *sense* the mood shift in the conversation, and the discomfort of the other person. 
I disagree strongly. We hear about domestic violence all the time and how dangerous male pedophiles are to children. Those things should turn the mood shift in the convo but what about the fact that mothers sexually/emotionally/physically abuse their children more than fathers do? We never hear about that..... because it doesn´t fit the liberal narrative of men are flawed savages and women are perfect angels. The data in case you think I´m making it up. http://www.americanhumane.org/children/stop-child-abuse/fact-sheets/child-abuse-and-neglect-statistics.html   
I'm not denying that that's a thing, I've encountered it myself, just saying that suicide in general is treated as this "bad topic" and if you don't acknowledge it it doesn't exist. 
and they could do the same thing with domestic violence, treat it as a " bad topic " that if you don´t acknowledge it, it doesn´t exist. But they don´t choose to do that because it mostly (60%) affects women. I still strongly disagree with what you said.
I agree that domestic violence is an issue, and that domestic violence against men is not given the same attention/taken as seriously as violence against women, especially when the attacker is a woman, because men are often expected to be able or willing to either fight back and win or take the beating and not say anything. 

Right, because nothing says "I'm here for you" like clicking "report this post". Way to remove the humanity from it completely. All they need now is a little machine learning to automate the reporting, and you won't even need friends!
The point isn't to report the post, it's a separate process from reporting a post actually. The friend can ask an outside person to take a look at it and reach out to the poster in question

I'm so very sorry for your loss. Keep your head up, and move forward, I bet she would tell you the same.
Thank you.
Very beautiful. She looked like a sweet person. Try to remember the beautiful things and share her spirit with the world.
[deleted]
Where at all does it say that? Just remembering a friend of mine that has passed away. 
I doubt that's what she meant to say. She just thinks her friend was beautiful and she's sad her friend committed suicide. 

I've had 3 friends do it, and it makes me sad, so I do understand. My friends were all guys, so I don't think the term "beautiful" applies to them in the most strict physical sense, but there were all beautiful people who apparently struggled with life more than any of us knew at the time. 

So, anyway, hamster. Out of curiosity, have you had a friend who committed suicide?
How fucked up is this? In the 1 hour since I wrote this, I learned of another friend who committed suicide. 

Listen people, we have to look out for each other. Clearly, I need to do a better job.


Cicadas have always been one of my favorite bugs.  I've always loved wearing the shells on my clothes like cute little brooches!  
Anyway, since I feel like depression has made a big impact on my life, I wanted to incorporate it into this assignment.  
Cicadas go into a dormant state for a considerably long time and eventually leave their shells behind.  They may look "dead" while dormant.  When my depression hits harder, I feel like a dormant cicada- alive but not quite there.  A "shell of a person", as my mom puts it.  
My life is often a struggle to break out of this shell that makes me appear "dead" and try to live again without the shell trapping me.  I tried to depict that with this image.  I hope that makes sense.
I like the imagery of this a lot, especially with the ghostly hand reaching out to someone.  I often feel the same way.

"Depression will lie to you. Depression will try to tell you what others are thinking.  That you are unloved and unworthy, that others think little of you or don’t care – or even wish you harm. You are not a psychic. Keep repeating that. “I am not a psychic”.  Repeat. The only way to know what another person is thinking is to up and ask them."

Accurate.
#13 (limit your time with people who drain you) is tough when it's your spouse  
This... Is amazing. I'd agree with every point, although it's taken me a long time to understand these things myself, it's nice to see it all already out there - and know that I'm not alone. :) 
...Now if I could just get over the urge to print it off and slap it into peoples faces screaming "Number fucking twelve, you cunt!", I'd be grand... 

I've been with my girlfriend for roughly 2.5 years. When we first met she suffered from anxiety. It was mildly bad and she was medicated for it with Beta blockers.

Over time her mental health has deteriorated massively. I have tried incredibly to help her with everything, encouraging, supporting and solving issues right across the board. I grew up with a manic depressive parent and have decent understanding and awareness of mental health, so I've always felt like I could take it in my stride.

Three months ago she started self-harming. When that happened I encouraged her to find a therapist and she did. 

10 days ago she overdosed on co-codamol, consuming 10grams of paracetamol in the process. She spent four days in hospital, attempted to discharge herself on the third day. The whole period through that has ruined me.

She claims if was an accident and that she wanted to fall asleep. She thought the codeine portion would do that and didn't realise paracetamol was dangerous.

I've been able to deal with almost everything she's thrown at me but this feels like one too far. She's smart, clever and good at understanding people. I feel like our trust has been ripped up and I have no energy left for anything, that our relationship is dead.

Her behaviour is incredibly reminiscent of Bordeline Personality Disorder. She swings moods, tells me off for things that don't matter and pushes people away constantly. She constantly changes between bring the nicest, sweetest person alive and someone completely different. 

She wants constant attention. Only last night she sat in her car for four hours outside her work. This happened after I said I wanted to see my friends for the evening. She becomes emotionally hysterical, saying she constantly feels like I don't care. No matter how often I jump her bar, she moves it higher.

I feel lied to, emotionally blackmailed and pulled apart. I don't know if these feelings are valid, 

Now I'm at breaking point. I lost what was good about our relationship and I'm so bloody sad. I cried for 15 minutes last night. Its the first time I cried in six years. As a person who starts each days happy, like a 25 year old male Cinderella metaphor, it's completely shit.

We've lost all the fun. She won't do anything like we used to and have a terrible relationship. 

I'm also terrified of breaking up with her. She has one close friend who she won't talk to about problems, two parents who lack understanding and communication and no one else. She uses me as a crutch for everything and is genuinely suicidal on a daily basis. 


Please help reddit.

*apologies if this is a ramble.
Hi, preferably she needs to have a full case review. Beta blockers are no longer used for first line treatment in anxiety disorders, they can cause severe depression and insomnia if they are ones that cross the blood brain barrier (Propranolol etc.) She needs to see a good psychiatrist for a meds review and should be seeing a clinical psychologist or counselor regularly, preferably a minimum of once per week. There are some brilliant new generation antidepressants that are used to help sleep disorders too, mirtazapine being a good one with low toxicity in overdose and very effective for insomnia.
I'm sorry you are going through this.  Please don't forget to take care of yourself.  I was going through something much milder than what you are going through and seeing a therapist myself helped me tremendously. 
Hey again /u/llpavey

With regard to the relationship situation I can understand how difficult it is. I'm no relationship guru but I would use the principle in the established relationship advice that; You should discuss an argument/hurt feelings when the dust has settled, not during the storm of emotions. It sounds like your girlfriend is currently in crisis. If you decide to leave her, it would likely be better for you and her to wait until she is out of crisis before telling her, even if you've made your mind up. 

I get the impression that you're in the UK? If so there should be a crisis team or a community mental health​ team (basically a multi disciplinary team with nurses, psychiatrists, social workers etc) Try to find the number for the team and contact them. I was in a similar situation to her last year and after treatment from the crisis team I'm a different person, so much better. Also, personality disorders take months to diagnose by a doctorate qualified person, I would avoid trying to self-diagnose. If you want any UK specific assistance I'd be happy to go into more detail with you. 
Seems like your girlfriend is a lot like my wife. 

The constant need for attention, self harm, personality changes etc..

That's all spot on with my wife. 

Almost 2 years ago we got my wife into an inpatient facility where they kept her for a while to get her meds right. It has helped tremendously. She has self harmed like twice since then, but her episodes of depression are much shorter now. She seems to have the ability to get out of them quicker. 

I learned to focus on making me better. This is my wife, I made a commitment to her and I will keep it as long as I can. The only way I knew how to stay "ok" was to focus on me. So, I started lifting weights, eating healthy etc.. 

Before long she got into it with me and it has become something rather amazing. I'm not saying it's all better and everything but exercise, routine, and a good diet are all things that have benefited her tremendously. 

However, let me say first. Before you make a decision to stay committed to this girl be sure you know what you're doing. The worst thing you can possibly do is tell her your committed and then leave. If she's worth it, stick around, and help her. 

She needs to help herself and grow, find a new caretaker or fail.  She's not your daughter.
Bud, she needs help you can't give her. People who are mentally ill must first believe there is a problem with their behavior before they can get help. The longer you enable her to act this way (even if you do not realize you're an enabler) the worse it will become. You have no obligation to see her through this anymore at this point if she will not acknowledge the issues; you're only going to go down with her at this point. Its hard but its easier to remember the girlfriend you broke it off with because she was crazy rather than having a crazy girlfriend that committed suicide despite your help. This is coming from someone who has dealt with similar situations.
First off, it's important that you differentiate her from the illness. What she is doing because of her illness, and what she is doing because that's just how she's like. Presuming it's the former, then, like others have mentioned, you are not, and cannot expect to be able to magically save her. You are a partner, not a therapist. 

A lot of people are already telling you what you could do to make things easier for her, so I won't do that. Instead, I'm going to tell you **do not neglect yourself; always practice self-care**. If you plan to take care of her long-term, you need to make sure that you take care of yourself. If you do get pushed to a neurotic breakdown, you won't be able to take care of her at all and will cause her more distress. Take care of yourself so you can take care of her. You can also take "shifts" with that close friend of hers. Work together with her if you're the only two people she trusts. 

You should also think about your future with her if you stay in this relationship. Sometimes, people with mental disorders get so enshrouded by illness that you can't even see him/her anymore. (S)he just isn't the same. But, this I can promise you - she's in there somewhere and she's terrified. However, it can take years to even see a hint of that person again when the illness is severe. 

Are you willing to take care of her your entire life? Will you love her nonetheless? Is that love enough fuel for you? It's okay if your answer is no. I know you're afraid that it'll push her over the edge if you leave, but what happens if all this pushes *you* over the edge? You're not married yet, and all this is already taking an unbearable toll on you. What more if you're married and have to go through this every day for the rest of your life, most likely on your own? Is she even going to let you go to work? **Are you still going to love her**? Love is very powerful, but cannot be forced. Forcing yourself to love her (if you even want to call it that) for the rest of your life only leads to resentment and frustration, maybe even adultery. That being said, do take into consideration the current situation before you walk up to her and say, "I'm breaking up with you, bye." Think about it for awhile, wait for her to be more stable and, until then, you can take tiny steps back, have a serious discussion about her behaviour when she's more stable, and then think about it again. 
This sounds absolutely horrible. It also does sound like borderline behaviour. When I was going through hell with my borderline girlfriend I found a lot of help [here:](http://m.bpdcentral.com)

The support groups were especially helpful to me.

In the end you are probably going to leave for your own sanity. It's simply a terrible situation with no good answers. Still having the community at BPD Central helped me cope for quite a while. Sometimes people even find a way to stay. Whatever way you decide to go make sure you get the help you need.
It's important to remember that it's not your job to "save" her and she can't expect you to take the burden of all her problems, it's not fair. The fact that you even try should be more than enough. If you leave and something happens, that cannot be on you either. Hell, it's not even on her, it's on her mental illness. And with that said, her mental illness is turning her into someone else and she probably hates that and herself as well. Be honest with her, that you can't take the weight of her burdens much longer much the way she can't, and she needs to get help if not for herself than at least for you. 
If she pulls the whole "you're leaving me at my time of need, you're going to make me worse" and generally blaming you, then that's unhealthy, unfair and you maybe just can't change her mind. 
At the end of the day, only that person can be held responsible for their actions, and you can safely say you've tried everything. 

I really, really hope everything turns out okay!
I'm so sorry you're going through this. Here's a link to a book that might help, it's helped me understand my borderline but it's written for the perspective of people close to someone with bpd. 
[overcoming borderline](https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Healing/dp/0195379586) 
MY wife and I both struggle with mental illness/trauma. Me with PTSD and anxiety and her with Bi-polar disorder and OCD. Relationships with both partners struggling with mental health can be equally taxing and therapuetic, we go through extreme peaks and valleys as well. Maybe extremes need to be taken? in take programs for her, and for your relationship if the intimacy is gone maybe major changes there as well. We try almost anyhting to keep our marriage light. 
That's a shitty situation. Does she have an opiod problem? I have had three close friends who've made attempts and I have as well. The most important thing to do is get them locked in the psych ward so they can't hurt themselves.
Edit: (reply cos on mobile) there's also /r/askdocs where you can ask this question. 
Thanks for your advice. We almost never argue. I always try to make disagreements a balanced discussion and encourage both of us to day what's on our mind.

The scary but about all of this for me is that we are supposed to be moving in together in a week.

I'd also love some UK specific guidance please.
She's aware and accepting of her problems. I'm think I'm struggling with leaving someone I have a lot of love for there in their time of need.

I suppose a guilt about being selfish.
Cool. First of all start with the borough that your girlfriend lives in and Google crisis team alongside it. I live in Camden, London so I type in "Camden crisis team" 

Here is the result:
http://www.candi.nhs.uk/service-users-and-carers/crisis-care

It can be daunting making first contact with them, and although there is some very slight variance due to the individual person that you get on that day, generally they are caring empathic and highly qualified people. 

It's normal for someone in crisis to think "I'm not in crisis, I don't need this level of care, I don't want to use resources, what if they lock me up etc" and this can stop people from getting help. Ultimately you can't know this, once you speak to a clinician after contacting them it is their job to assess what resources are needed. They almost always say "you did the right thing by calling us" They almost never use inpatient/sectioning nowadays, even in crisis care. They usually treat the patient at home with daily visits for up to 2 weeks. In this two weeks you should have a visit from nurses, a psychiatrist a social worker and 24/7 phone support. 

There are a few boroughs in the UK which don't yet have a crisis team, which is below national standards. If your borough does not have a crisis team try the same search but use "community mental health team" instead. All boroughs should have this, if not let me know. That's a start, let me know if you find the crisis team for your borough and I can signpost a few more UK resources to add. 
After she was discharged did the crisis team do a follow up? Normally they do. 

If you break up with her, tell that other friend and her parents and walk away. You don't need to support her through the break up, there are other people even if you think she's going to hurt herself. If she says she's going to do something immediately, call 999. Even if she doesn't do anything they'll send someone over to chat to her and either take her to hospital to be assessed or make arrangements for her to see an emergency doctor. 
It's probably not a good time to move in together, unless you're really willing to be in this situation 24/7 without any chance of getting away from it. 

As much as you can, try to get her to reach out to others and build up a support structure that's not just you. It's dangerous and unsustainable for you to be the only person she feels like she can go to. Try your best to make sure that she feels that she can find help in various places, that it's urgent, that she deserves it.

Intensive outpatient therapy programs might be worth looking into, or even an inpatient one, but those are expensive and hard to find (at least here in the US. Hell-any mental health support is pretty rough to find)

Does this piece of art make you feel better?
I wrote about this piece on my blog [here](http://www.pixelle.co/georgia-okeeffe/) if you'd be interested in reading it! :)
Personally, yes! I find it very soothing. What do you think about this piece? (I'd appreciate your feedback so I know what direction to go in with my next art posts in here, something that I've been enjoying doing.) Thanks :)

Schizophrenia has an awful stigma as perhaps the "scariest" of all mental health issues - people picture dangerous psychopathic murderers who have no control or empathy, largely because the only exposure they have toward it is from movies that give it this absurd portrayal. As such, it's even more stigmatized than mental illnesses like depression or anxiety. 

In fact, that's pretty much how I felt until I met my first person with schizophrenia (that I was aware of) in college. Then I met Matt, and that *was* scary at first - we'd be hanging out and it was all great but then he'd start mumbling incoherently or saying something completely unrelated to what we were talking about. But those instances were few and far between, and I spent enough time with Matt to realize that he was one of the most compassionate and lovely people I've ever met, despite his illness - he was never dangerous, and always a great friend. 

The "scary" stigma is a tough one to shake, but I can only hope that more people are able to expose themselves to the people behind the illness. I'm thankful for people like the author (is that you, OP?) for being willing to share themselves with the world like that.
I'd love to meet someone with schizophrenia, it intrigues me so much. I never took it as a bad thing and it really shoots my curiosity. You know when they say "The pretty ones are always crazy"? I'd really love dating one of the "crazy" ones, that meaning a schizophrenic.

Disclaimer: Not calling people with schz. crazy.
Welcone to  the DSM 5 club
I had a guy at an internship who was over me question why I wanted to pass my genetics down one time. This was after I told him I had 2 kids. Something something about bettering the human species. He was a pos. 

I walked out and never came back. I had to explain it to my professor, and I told her to not send anyone there for an internship. 2 weeks later, the student beside me is mentioning starting at internship there. Wtf is wrong with people? 



lol who downvotes this? 
I have written the following for my boyfriend, who lives far away and I have been talking to very little, out of cognitive dissonance. Has anybody else experienced something like this? I feel like garbage. Can anybody offer advice or support?

I am aware that I've become more distant lately, partially because I have been wrapped up in psychic pain and attempting to escape or deny a hopeless reality, but there is no way of avoiding it anymore. Because you've been there for me a number of times, and because I've attempted to do the same, it's important for me to explain. In the last few months, I have been realizing parts of myself that don't correlate with the person that I thought I was or wanted to be. Frankly, I feel like I am barely there. 

I just swirl around in a disjointed daydream most of the time, compulsively looking for distraction, direction, or assurance, trying interests and activities that inevitably fizzle out because they have nothing to attach to. I thought I just hadn't found myself yet, maybe I was looking in the wrong places, maybe I needed to try harder, but it shouldn't be so effortful to find enjoyment. It shouldn't be detective work to figure out what interests me or makes me feel good. It's an oxymoron. 

My thoughts are cyclical, unimaginative, and self-centered to the point of obliviousness to the world, and my range of feelings seems more limited and negative than other people's. I knew I felt awkward socially, but I assumed any disconnect was due to anxiety, depression, even Asperger's or something. Now I find myself seriously considering that I am low in empathy. Not sadistically, but stupidly so. I probably just overcompensated because it was my version of normal, thinking that I was sensitive because I was prone to chronic loneliness and shame. Thinking that I could relate because I wanted to. I guess I thought that I could understand others through effort or intent, but it didn't occur to me that this is a natural automatic thing for people, and that "trying" to do it is contrived and delusional. 

I'm old enough to realize that this is longstanding enough to be a problem, and I can't just wish myself out of it. I've read about trauma, neglect, personality disorders, and I'm in therapy, on medication, and doing neurofeedback, which is expensive and not even widely accepted. I guess that speaks to my desperation, if anything. Not that it excuses me from responsibility. You are a good person, and I look up to you in a lot of ways, but good people caring about me isn't going to fix a lifetime of relational and personal dysfunction. I don't know why I am like this, why I always do this. I know that this is shitty, and I don't feel good about it.

Nobody wants to believe that their mode of functioning throughout life has been stunted, shallow, and delusional. I thought it was something I'd work my way out of, through reinvention, through willpower and learning. I'm just essentially running out of ways to reinvent, and I'm left with a void. Believing I can "solve" distorted, myopic thinking through more thinking is just dumb. Believing I can healthily attach seems like an illusion, when I don't feel I have any substance to attach.

The fact, as far as I can tell, is that you have an entire world that is much deeper and more textured and coherent, grounded opinions and interests, and it's just not fair to put you in a position of relying on someone who is like a puddle or a mirage in comparison, who cannot adequately share experiences or communicate. I did have raw moments, and feel cared for, but I think I underestimated the leap I was making. I wanted to think that maybe this was a temporary dip or a confusion that would clear up eventually, get sorted out, but it's not. I don't know if it ever will. 

It has been difficult for me to figure out what to do, considering the weight of the topic. I am not the best at discerning or decision making, but it's not an excuse for omission. 

TL;DR: I think I am delusional and narcissistic, and I don't want you to feel bound to me when you have more needs than I can probably fulfill. I'm not sure that I can change, but that's no excuse to deny the realization.

I relate to most of what you have written about. I have always overcompensated and still managed to lose  many friends. Probably because I unsettle them by overcompensating. I noticed how I hated people more and how I hated myself more when I was doing that. I was angry with everyone including myself all the time. 

A few months ago, I realized how I was trying to justify my anger, I was always telling myself that there is something wrong with me, I can never have friends or be in a relationship because I am a fraud and nobody can understand that and they don't deserve to suffer with me. So I decided to stay away from people whom I was overcompensating for and told my boyfriend that I wasn't worthy of him. 

Everyday now, I remind myself that when I was overcompensating, they never tried to be my friend. I still feel I am a selfish fraud, but I tell myself I was trying by overcompensating, so that must mean a part of me isn't as selfish as I believe it to be. My boyfriend thankfully saw more good in me than I did and refused to give up on me. In some selfish corner of my mind, I was so happy he refused. 
If you can think for your boyfriend, I don't think you are narcissistic.  Neurofeedback is really expensive. If it hasn't been effective, why don't you consider cutting it?

Don't give up on yourself. Your boyfriend can think for himself; respect that and let him decide if he wants to stay around - just do your part to keep trying and get better. Talk to him to honestly about what you feel. Hope it works out for you.
You could try oxytocin spray nootropic. 
Thanks for your reply. I'm not sure if I meant overcompensating in the same way, at least not anymore. I don't ever make an effort with my friends unless they contact me. Now it's the same with him...there are times where I just wish he'd break up with me. By overcompensating, I guess I mean sending messages just to stay in touch, responding to things as if I think they're funny even when I don't, basically keeping up appearances, and I know I can't do it forever. It's been like this for at least a month now.
I wouldn't say I can really think for him. I can't "get inside his head" or see his perspective, or feel how he feels. I'm keeping with the neurofeedback because it gives me something to look forward to after work, honestly. Sometimes I feel calmer afterward. I'm very desperate for any relief from constant anxiety and suicidal thinking, so the money doesn't bother me too much.
Thanks. I'll look into this.
Hi everyone. I'm going through an incredibly severe depression, and have started on a new medication and with a new doctor. I'm single, and I live alone. I have no support system. I have been largely abandoned.

I was thinking today about all my friends who have gotten married and had babies and bought houses. I alway marvel at how people rally around each other for happy milestones, and lend moral support and practical help and even monetary help. People sacrifice to help out when others are at their happiest.

But when someone has debilitating depression, people seem to jump ship. There isn't the same support. People don't show up, even when you beg for help. I mean, people rally around each other even when they're enduring the death of a loved one, but depression? No one wants to know you.

I have my theories as to why this is, but wondered what this community thinks of that phenomenon, and if it's ever happened to you.

I could really use the help and attention that a new bride or mother would be getting right around now. But instead I'm going it alone and struggling greatly.

Thanks, everyone :)
You won't like to hear this but it is partially Darwinism.  People have lives, we all have lives to live, family to support, jobs to go to, our own mental health to manage, pay our bills, make our meals, and unless it's a lovingly devoted blood relative you end up pretty much on your own. Your Illness is not on top of any one else's priority list.

A new birth or a new marriage, these events are temporary.
 A depressed person is an unknown. Again, usually the only folks, in the long run, who care enough about another are their parents or siblings.  Sad but true.

I've learned in my 59 years that what one reads and hears is mostly true, family is what it's all about. Friends, acquaintances, even spouses come and go but family (if you are blessed) is forever.
In my experience it's been people wanting to help...not knowing how to help...and "deciding" to do nothing? Or come up with empty words like "it'll get better" rather than attempting to put in the work. Sometimes they have their own baggage that makes it difficult to know how to help. 
It's almost always our own minds that cause us so much trouble. We dwell on our perceived failures and our past griefs and it's hard, depression is a soul sucker, for lack of a better description.

I am really really glad you are seeing a doctor and starting a new med. Sometimes in the beginning weeks of new meds, our symptoms can become even more intense, and doctors do not always tell you that!

Anyway, ask your doctor for help, if he's just a meds doc, see a counselor. They can recommend group therapy or even just support groups, many local hospitals host them. A really good bet is the hospital your use, if you have one, or a local one, ask to speak with the social worker. These people can be Godsends. They usually all kinds of helpful info and are glad to help steer you.

Try as hard as you can to do what you Can do. If your niece and nephew are nearby, see if you can't entice them to go out with you for a day's adventure here or there.      ONCE YOU GET OUT THERE, you almost always feel better. It's pushing yourself out the door and acting that is rough, at least it was for me.

Your life is not wasted. Some of your issue might be the big 40, which is a turning point for many. I am not a doc but I do know we all live with regrets over life choices and I also know that sometimes, when we least expect it, what is Truly intended for us surprises us by appearing.

If nothing else see if there isn't someone else in your circle at work who maybe looks like They could use a friend.   Even to just have lunch with.

Again , You are not alone. The world has become a larger, less intimately connected place. 

There may even be a private FB depression support page, I know there is one for survivors of suicide, as I used it for awhile and it helped. Or a subreddit here on Reddit. 

I wish you peace.
That's an honest question that I feel deserves an honest answer. Truth be told, depression looks like wining and weakness. To sit around bitching and crying for no actual reason can be extremely taxing for most people because there is no cheering you up. I could sit with you all day and you would still be depressed tomorrow. It's a mental illness and those dont go away. People aren't schooled I'm how to take on that kind of pressure for an extended period of time like people with depression requires. You can't expect everyone to come flocking to you just because you're sad. The neediness of depression is honestly annoying as shit. This is how I feel. I have friends with depression and I will always try to be there for them, but I have a limit to how much love I can give just like you have a limit to how much BS you can take. When you're depressed you're emotionally crippled, meaning you are useless to the individual and to society, says the world. Go prove them wrong, champ. Keep that blue head up and remember that you are responsible for your own emotions.
It's because people don't understand us and don't try to understand us. They cannot relate because they have not experienced what we have. They may think we are being dramatic or just want attention. If they cannot see something physically wrong with us, they don't believe it is a real issue. It's sad that some people aren't more understanding and compassionate  
Thanks so much :) I see that now, that family is everything. I did not plan well enough and tried to make my friends my family. I did not choose family-oriented men to date, so none of my relationships have led to marriage. 

I do have a brother and sister-in-law who are quite supportive, but they have their own lives. My mother is mentally ill — aggressively so — and she lives with my dad, who is essentially her hostage. So, no going to them for comfort anymore.

I also have a 15-year-old niece and 12-year-old nephew who I love, and who love me back. They're young, but they're growing up. I imagine that if I don't find a spouse who is committed to being like family with me, I'll be the sad, lonely aunt. That is never who I envisioned myself to be. 

Up until just a couple of years ago I had a wild, fun, successful NYC life. Friends have all moved on. I've never felt so isolated in all my life.

Thank you for your honest words.
Although not in real life, for what it's worth, you are not truly alone. never think that you are. we, all of us on this planet, are members of clubs we'd never choose.
I belong to the "have always fought depression" club, the 'survivors of a loved ones suicide' club, the ' relinquished a child to adoption' club, the 'lost my mom as a teen' club, and far more than ever I thought I deserved.

But all we can do is look for others like us and share support. Even being depressed, there are support groups, others who feel like you and probably want and need some back-up too.

Online, in real life, in therapy, they are out there. Depression can freeze us, I know this, but get your meds, get your therapist, get out and walk (they ALL told me that, all the therapists and doctors!) sunshine and fresh air being the answer to many of life's challenges, at least briefly.

I hope I did not come across cruelly. It's just what I have learned. It's not that people don't CARE, but most folks only have enough for themselves and their families. 
True, lifelong friends are a rare and very valuable gift.

Don't give up. You can get better, you can FEEL better and no one, not one of us can predict the future. There very well may be a man out there for whom you are the perfect fit and he, you.

Try the one day at a time method. It's easier to manage than looking far into the distance.

write back if you want. you're going to be ok. just do not give up.
Inside you somewhere, when you were born, heaven gave you a mighty force, a LIFE FORCE. 
even baby steps are progress.

edit: I am glad to read that you DO have some folks in your life who are available to you.
This is a blessing.
What u/yourpaleblueeyes said is in my experience very much the case. Which is why I now encourage my friends to set boundaries so they can accomplish those things with me in their life. I have found, though I haven't lived as long, that there are people out there who do value friends (or a certain community) as family. I have not been able to rely on my family for emotional support particularly well so finding a few of those people to treasure in my life has been imperative. I mean even family does set limits on what they can handle from you, my family can't handle my emotional issues, that's why I made those friends.
It really helps to hear your words of encouragement. Thank you, truly.

I'm sincerely sorry for all you've endured. No one deserves to go through any of that, and life is just so unfair in that some of us get great fortune and some of us get so many obstacles toward happiness. 

That said, you seem incredibly strong and certainly very insightful about it all. And very generous to share all of this with me.

My mind is really my worst enemy. It won't let me forgive myself for all the poor decisions I've made. For instance, there was one amazing guy who pursued me when I was 32, and is now married to someone else. I pushed him away in favor of a noncommittal bad boy. I recently burst into hysterical tears, rocking forward and backward, screaming, "I just didn't know! I just wasn't ready!"

In my mind, he was my ticket to understanding love and family values — because my own family life had been so fractured — and I was too stupid to understand you have to build your own family. I was too busy having fun. Now I'm turning 40, and my world is upside down.

It does feel like I'm totally alone, even when people — when you — say I am not. I don't know how to access those support systems. Those people who understand. I'm willing to give a lot of support back in return.

I do have a few friends who call to check in on me, and one who suffers from her own depression and regret, who is going out of her way to be there for me. But I hate being a burden on these people and feeling like a victim.

I have a big, bright smile and an infectious laugh. I haven't used them in a long time. I crave someone in my life who can draw that joy out of me again. I know, I know. I need to find it in myself. But when you're a single woman, almost aged-out of having a family, and alone, it's so so hard. And I'm even attractive. I get male attention a lot. But I have nothing to give back at the moment. I'm too deep in the darkness.

You're right, people do care, but don't have the time and resources to be there. There are also the friends I alienated, and the boyfriend I thought I was going to marry, who abandoned me in our apartment a few years ago. All of it has taken quite a toll.

Thank you so much for listening and offering advice. It feels good to connect even in this digital way. I wish you all the best -- all the love, strength, and happiness you can handle. Thank you <3


Bullying, * 
 the major causes of mental disorders in a child;

1. ADHD (Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)

It is a common disorder in children, the child has trouble in paying attention and is unable to concentrate on work assigned. In ADHD, the child displays immediate responses and acts before thinking things through. The child is unable to sit still for a constant interval of time. He/She keep on moving and show a hyperactive attitude which might be abnormal.

ADHD is hard to diagnose because the parents think that their child is going through a phase. But, if he/she experience something different in the behavior of the child then do not hesitate to visit a psychologist for proper diagnosis.

2. Eating Disorders

In Pakistan, parents express their love by feeding their children till their belly pops. At some point, the child avoids eating. But, for a continue https://www.marham.pk/healthblog/7-common-mental-disorders-in-children/


While many of the ideas in the article *are* partially correct, or correct in certain circumstances (*healthy* distraction *is* one of the coping mechanisms suggested by therapists who use [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), for example), [ANS](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=autonomic%20nervous%20system)-arousing games can be as (or more) counter-productive as they may be useful. 

Agitation of the ANS into even low-grade "[fight-flight-or-freeze](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=fight+flight+or+freeze)" can be expected to induce anxiety, depression and mania in many mental illness patients, in a neurophysiological manner similar to obsessive sex, over-exercise or substance abuse. 

I appreciate that one-on-one psychotherapy for such problems can be expensive, but in today's world, one-on-one work really isn't necessary most of the time. 

I use [SP4T](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=sensorimotor+therapy) as the 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-10-steps-of-emotion-processing.html) nowadays, but had good results over the years with [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy), [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [SEPt]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), [BCP/MCSP]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy) and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html)... all of which I was able to learn online or from books... and often do in inexpensive workbooks (mostly, but not entirely from New Harbinger, in Oakland, CA). 
As an anecdotal experience, some games with an aggressive bent (specifically, the original DOOM) have calmed me down when I was having a depression/anxiety freak out. I even made a post about it here on Reddit when it happened. 

My primary problem is depression, rather than anxiety, but taking a few moments to blast through a few of the anxiety-inducing levels of DOOM were soothing. There are a lot of factors there, my nostalgia for the game, the art style being so removed from realism, etc. And there are a lot of different flavors of depression and anxiety. 

Then there are a lot of other kinds of games out there. Civilization IV is also a very soothing game with a completely different mindset behind it. Empire management, which requires complex tasks to be performed and requires a great deal of mental run time. Hunie Pop is a puzzle/dating sim. Final Fantasy, a jRPG series with turn based combat and emphasis on exploration, are good options. 

There's a bit of a taboo about taking a game break, especially at work which is really bad for those of us who don't have jobs where taking a quick break at the onset of an episode is -- if not condemned, frowned upon. 


Yes; if your primary problem is depression, the *stimulation* afforded by playing the game can in fact be functional. And I would say this is especially so if your particular "brand" of depression is more genetic and neurobiological than it is cognitive > affective > behavioral. See below (picked up from material I use with patients):

1) If you're taking drugs of any kind (including alcohol), take yourself to a detox and get off of them with expert help. (This kind of depression is actually chronic, cyclical, feedback-looping over-stimulation and [withdrawal](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=drug+withdrawal+psychology).)

2) If you came from a [crazy-making family](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dysfunctional+family), get yourself to an [ACA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=adult+children+of+alcoholics+) meeting and read everything on their website before making any further decisions. (You'll find you are not only not alone, but that thousands of other people have found their way out of the "soup" in ACA.)

3) If you [stressed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=autonomic+stress+response) your way into depression, understand that your [autonomic nervous system](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=autonomic+nervous+system) is probably tilted out of balance, and that rest, relaxation, vitamins, healthy food and appropriate medications and supplements (not always including anti-depressants, btw) offer good possibilities.

4) If you have [thought](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cognitive+distortions) your way into depression with shame, guilt, worry, remorse, regret and morbid reflection, dig into the better cognitive psychotherapies like [REBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=rebt+therapy), [CBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cbt+therapy), [critical thinking](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=critical+thinking) and [schema therapy](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), all of which have much better than even potential of getting your mind out of the mental mush and into reality. 
I just wanted to share something that I'm proud of myself for. I've been struggling with depression for the past few months and I'm really working hard at dealing with it in a productive manner. Yesterday my car was towed and I ate pizza (still working on my relationship with food, feeling very guilty about this). Left me feeling very weird and bad today, the sort of depressed that makes you really tired and lethargic even though there were things I wanted/needed to do. I started getting upset with myself for "not being able to do anything". So I removed myself from the bed, I took a shower, went and got some Starbucks. I came back, cleaned up a little, and journaled out all my feelings and made more plans about how to approach the things I need to do and in what capacities I can handle them. I let myself feel sad because it's okay to feel sad and then I moved forward instead of dwelling on it. And I'm really proud of myself for that. 
Good for you! Depression is a horrible beast and the only way to deal with it is one day at a time, just as you're doing. And yes it's ok to feel sad but like you say, you recognised it for what it was and didn't let it consume you. I tip my hat to you - you should be very proud :)
Don't beat yourself up for not doing everything at once (ie food).  One step at a time is how all journeys are accomplished.
Thanks for sharing, I feel inspired. :)
I'm proud of you too, well done!
And now we're proud of you too! Keep kicking its ass one day at a time. :)
Sweet :) hardest part is the first push in to get started

Good on him man.  Glad he can find the strength to seek answers, his music is for sure an expression of deep emotions and is on my "bummer" playlist, you can hear in his music he understands the things he speaks about.

Thank you for posting.

wow, whoever wrote that article is an absolute arsehole
I am so greatful to this woman for the videos she posts. She brings so much understanding to mental illness in general, and eating disorders in particular. It's helpful both to people going through something like this, and also to the people around these people!
I really want to say I love her spunk but apparently that means something else outside the US. 
I posted the same thing yesterday but under a different title. I don't think many people saw it, but I'm glad you posted it and got more traction. I think many people need to watch this! 
And still you see that kind of articles all the time. People think that they are right, just because they're healthy, but the truth is they have no idea what it's like because they haven't experienced it. What they think is true is just them unable to understand.
Absolutely

I'm having a difficult time wrapping my head around this situation and where to land.  What are other people's thoughts?
Are the details/text of the conversation posted anywhere?
Stupid girl I would have stopped him from doing it.
She looks like Arya Stark.
I'm conflicted, personally I believe people have a fundamental right to choice how and when they die, if they so choose. Within reason, no one else would be hurt via them doing so, I.e. no suicide bombings.


I have a friend, whom at one point was very suicidal. He would tell me what he was going to do, I would support whatever he thought he wanted to do at the time. He never went through with anything.


I'm going to talk about my dead boyfriend next. He had suicidal tendencies, voices in his head yelling at him to kill himself, some real hard stuff. I know he is at peace now, he knew the risk when he started using. I'm not saying it was on purpose that he died, he actually didn't think he could and tried a few times, proving him right.

Anyway, when he was my boyfriend and alive I would never wanted him to end his suffering, because we love each other and wouldn't do that to the other person.

I think this girl is mean. I see her as like doctor Kevorkian's helper. If the dude wanted to die and she helped, that's fine. If he changed his mind, as people often do, and didn't want to go through with it anymore and she bullied him into it, then she is a murderer, not a helper.
She should be charged with murder. 
Young Cersei Lannister. 

Nice piece. I worry that this direct confrontation gives more fuel to this fire.  I realize folks are trying to categorize their feelings on outlets like Tumblr. I would hope that everyone who feels compelled to publish their feelings to the world can build a relationship to a mental health professional that they trust. Move their work from contemplative to actualization. I agree that suffering has become a gross public display, meant to elicit a response to a hungry audience,  and I'm not familiar with any modalities that suggest that as an outlet to healing.  Thank you for posting. 
I like her quote about flowery nonsense. There definitely seems to be this trend on social media to spin everything into positive flowery nonsense and it's unfortunate that certain groups have felt that anorexia and depression belong in there.

The worst part is that some people may use these sources as a replacement for education and that makes the actions of those who perpetuate this idea rather reckless.

That said, I think the big problem is that because mental health is treated so frivolously and hush hush in the real world, people simply wander into the internet seeking help. And herein lies an entire community with literally no idea what they're doing perpetuating nonsense in an effort to do SOMETHING about it... anything... to cope with this issue. Can't really fault them, to be sure.
There's lots of misinformation about mental health on the Internet.when I was first diagnosed with anxiety I couldn't believe it at first because thanks to the Internet and people saying" omg I can't get out of my home and socialise with ppl I must have anxiety lol" it confused me a lot .i used to think being socially awkward and  anxiety were the same things .and I'm not a socially awkward person. People should stop throwing around words like "depression" "anxiety" "bipolar"
Thankfully as more and more people become educated, and the facts about mental illness (and the dangers of romanticizing it) are flooding social media sites more and more often, the problem appears to be getting less. At least here in Australia. 

While I personally don't find myself bothered by it, I do disagree with it in principle. It can have a truly terrible impact on so many people... I'll be glad to see the end of it. 
I know what you mean, but I think there's an important distinction, in that sharing personal experience stories explain the realities if mental illness and cab therefore help to dispel stigma.

Thanks! Saved for those really dark times :)
Beautiful. I'm tearing up :) 
Really needed this tonight. Thank you
No, you're a liar
Hi, just looking for some advice. My partner has depression and anxiety issues. She told the DVLA (we are in the UK), and her psychiatrist sent in a supporting letter stating that her mental health should have no effect on her ability to drive.

However, the DVLA have asked for her license back, stating that ANYONE with a mental illness is not allowed to drive. They seem to imply that it is a complete blanket ban.

There is the option to appeal this at court - I wondered whether anyone had done this, or knew what the success rate was like in this instance. I cannot imagine that everyone in the UK who has been diagnosed with depression is going to be banned from driving, so I guess either most people don't tell the DVLA, or the appeals process is regularly used.

Any other advice would be greatly appreciated.
This is probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. 1 in 4 people suffer from a mental health condition, do the DLVA seriously want a quarter of all drivers off the road?! I'm so sorry this is happening to you. 

I would appeal it for sure, and get talking to mental health charities too. Mind is a great one; I'm sure they'll be able to advise you. Also try your local Citizen's Advice Bureau. I hope you can sort this out (: 
Appeal. This is ridiculous, I've never heard of it. As greatgatsby says 1 in 4 of us suffer so that would be a lot of people off the road. It would affect lots of employment areas too, which I'm sure the government would not want.

Let us know how you get on.
Definitely speak to someone at your local Mind Centre (or check the website for more information). The dvla can revoke a licence is if there is significant risk of harm or impairment because of a condition. In the case of mental health, an immediate revoking of a licence usually only happens if the driver is sectioned under the mental health act. If your partner has never had any issues with driving that have arisen from a mental health condition (i.e. suicidal ideation involving crashing the car, psychotic or manic episodes, delayed reaction due to medication) then there's no cause for the licence to be refused. Especially if you have a letter from the psychiatrist to support that she is safe to drive. 
Indeed. The same is the case in The Netherlands. Usually the advice from psychiatrists is: if we diagnose that you shouldn't be in public (danger to yourself), or if you start taking new medications (disorienting), then you shouldn't drive. But just *don't tell* the CBR (UK: DVLA, US: DMV). 

There is no evidence published that anything beyond that is necessary. The official rules are that you are not permitted to drive for *1-2 years* after your diagnosis has been cleared. Usually pretty dysfunctional for someone to pick up their normal life again. In The Netherlands you are not mandated to state your own psychological condition to the CBR, only the 'moral duty'.
Well aint that the most backward thing I heard this weekend. Sorry to hear that mate, I hope she gets sorted out. It would set me back a fair bit if someone took my license away from me, apart from the fact I make a living using my van, just not having the freedom to do what I want would probably send me into a spiral of depression. Fucking twats, appeal it!
There's going to be a lot of empty streets then if that's the case
[removed]
This is fucked up.
Wow. I've never been told to inform the DVLA either by my GP or my Psycologist. Could you share the letter online? I'd love to ask MIND ot ReThink if it is a standard letter.
I'm a long term "service user" who has just got discharged from an acute ward two days ago, and I have schizoaffective disorder (schizophrenia and bipolar - I was diagnosed with this in 2005) and I have been driving for 11 years with no points on my license.

It's a merry-go-round for me. I'm on a DVLA 1-year renewing medical license so my insurance is relatively high, but i dont have a car.
[deleted]
More like a lot of people who would benefit from mental health treatment, but won't try to get it because they don't want to lose driving priviliges. 
I cannot believe this, it is completely and utterly preposterous. If we tried, we could diagnose everyone with some form of mental illness - what I'm trying to say is that it's so personal and so unique to each individual that a blanket ban is completely and utterly absurd.

Thank you for the link though! (: 

Good luck with that one.
We need a reform. However, I am not signing this petition because people of those ages will be HEAVILY over diagnosed and it will be another way for the psychiatric industry to make more money off of them. Way too many children are diagnosed with things that either don't actually exist or things they can overcome on their own. The good idea is there, but it will not turn out well.
Very good. Overdue.
This is a very good counterpoint to which I don't really have a rebuttal. The one thing is, I don't think the tests would be about diagnosing named disorders. It would be more about getting children used to understanding that being tested to make you're you're mentally sound is completely normal. And when there are problems, then you can talk it over. 

Then again people like diagnosing and medicating their kids so it's certainly a bit inevitable.

Could be a good way of getting younger people more familiarised with mental health disorders.

I enjoyed the artwork, and this link still got my upvote.  
But I dislike the handling of the subject matter. Mental Illness is just that, an illness, much like diabetes or cancer. Certainly you can create an artistic manifestation of any disease, but the perception that exist in society is that mental illness is a sort of magic. This link reinforces that, when in reality mental illness comes from science phenomenon and can be treated by medicine.
That artwork was very enjoyable 
Thank you.. that is why I posted this :)

 Syloh, 
We know that mental illness is just like any other form of illness. Mental illnesses are just hyped. If you read the write up above the posters, you could see that we said exactly what you are saying. 

Thanks for your response by the way :)
Thanks :)
As many of us know, there's a huge stigma when it comes to mental illness and discussing sometimes difficult emotions. Those who've seen my posts will know the problems I personally faced; I self-harmed, was diagnosed with depression and eventually tried to take my own life.

In all honesty it was just a bit shit really. No one understood or wanted to know because it would make their uncomplicated happy little existence uncomfortable. And so, like many who suffer, I suffered alone and in silence.

Well I'm proud to say I'm not that person anymore. I don't have the uncontrollable desire to hurt myself or punish myself. And so I stared a blog about mental illness, dealing my experiences and giving support and advice on how I conquered my demons. Something I wish I'd had 15 years ago.

So imagine my shock and surprise when, on the mental health part of reddit no less, a place where people should be able to come for support and non-judgemental advice, one rather eloquent and wonderful member called my blog 'whiny' and nothing but 'teen angst'.

While my initial reaction wasn't great - you don't come away from years of self-hate unscathed - it dawned on me the sheer irony of this comment and that this kind of attitude is exactly the problem. Because many don't feel they or their feelings are important enough to be taken seriously. Because it's just 'teen angst' and people's general view point is to 'just get over it'.

Which for those of who have truly suffered know isn't that simple.
Because what might seem like a very small problem to the outside world, can eat us alive from the inside out until there is nothing of ourselves left but a hollow place where our souls used to be.

So thank you to the commenter who proved exactly why it's so important to carry on with my 'whiny' mental health blog, to not stop talking about these issues. To never stop fighting against the discrimination.
[deleted]
I think the angst part of his comment was aimed at a particular question I posed, and so it doesn't quite make sense to generalize it like this.

The whiny blog bit was over the top, I agree, especially considering the venue.
THIS!!! When people brush things off as "trying to get attention" or just "teenage stuff", especially self-harm. Such a pet peeve. People so often try to put parameters on what's "serious" mental problems and what's not and it gets to the point that unless you end up killing yourself or in a mental health facility then you're "not really that sick". Thank you for being brave and open enough to tell your story and making mental health issues visible!
The psychology of stigma is an interesting one and I did some research/thinking about it.

When a person talks about their problems (mental health for example), the amount of empathy another person has to give them can depend on many factors - a significant one being the amount of empathy they have received for their own problems. It may also depend on whether they can identify and associate with your circumstance due to similar life experiences.

This is why you can get a variety of responses to the same problem.

My advice is - if you think your blog is a worthwhile venture with good intentions, then keep doing it, but be open to constructive feedback at the same time. I'm guessing you already know this though.


You are not supposed to talk about your mental problems, that's what i have learned from my fellow medical students.                     

When I first had a "relapse" at the beginning of our final semester, my study partner got furious, I was supposed to "get it together", and when I couldn't, I was just an ass hole that she never wanted to talk to again.                                                 
             
Then while trying to finish these damn studies, I start talking to a group about what we had been doing to get us behind. I'm an honest person, so i just tell them "I was gone because of mental illness" It was obvious that no one wants to hear it, the conversation quickly changed. Afterwards my new study buddy takes me aside, and tells me that in the future i should not talk about my mental problems, people don't need to know.           

I learned a lot from this. As a medical student you have to be perfect, or at least fake it. I have met several students that got behind because of mental illness, but they all seem to hide in plain sight. And they all tell me the same thing: do not admit your illness to anyone, they will never treat you the same.                                        
 
I hope they have some better reactions prepared when they have to deal with mentally ill patients. And I sincerely hope they not forget that the mentally ill, are also ordinary people.

I may be a little late for this, but i just wanted to drop a line and say what you're doing is awesome, it takes a heck of a lot to be open about this 
Hey! I have an Etsy store where the proceeds will be donated to a mental health foundation. Check it out here! https://www.etsy.com/shop/ThePositiveArtist?ref=hdr_shop_menu
Fair enough, you're entitled to that opinion, just as I am to mine, by which I stand. If people don't feel they can talk about their issues without them being belittled, I call that Stigma. I enjoy constructive criticism very much - it's a chance to do things better. But that's not what I am talking about here, neither is it what you're offering (unless you're a professor of English?).  If you don't enjoy my style of writing or my blog, you are welcome not to read it. But there's no need to insult what I am doing which is ultimately just trying to help. There are plenty enough people who do enjoy it, who can relate and who do find it useful. I write for them. No one person's experience is the same as another, I respect that and know my own experiences will not resonate with everyone. But when it does, and I know it's made a bit of difference, it's worth everything.
Thank you for this comment! It's really horrendous the way people do that isn't it! The whole reason why there is such stigma, is not just because of people who don't suffer, but also from those who do which is incredibly sad. It's not a competition. We should all stick together, be stronger as one. Not having to justify the seriousness of our feelings. Really appreciate your kind words :) 
I made a comment once saying how my daughter had survived 4 attempts (it is now 5) but some asshole commented how I clearly must not be getting her therapy and help and how that many attempts is just her wanting attention.  (You know, because clearly if you survive you weren't *really* trying to kill yourself)


This is a very interesting comment, thank you for posting. :) And I shall keep going with my blog. For the one bad comment, come plenty showing that what I'm doing is making a difference, at least to some people. And that's all I ever wanted. 
This is sad to hear, especially since in the medical profession where you would like to think things like that can be spoken about more openly. :( I hope you have found at least one person to talk to about you struggles.
Thank you for taking the time to post this lovely comment :) x
He's still not talking about the issues you had, but how you present it.
I had my own dad tell me several months ago that the only "truly suicidal people" are the ones who "say nothing but silently go and kill themselves".  He went on to say that nobody should be seeking help before or after a suicide attempt because it's all for attention.

Thanks for understanding your daughter!
Omg that's awful! I just don't understand how people can be so utterly devoid of feeling. If you don't understand or can't sympathise with a situation, then surely just ignore and move on. So horrid. I'm so sorry to hear about your daughter's struggle :( It must be utterly heartbreaking and devastating for you to watch her like this. xx
Thank you. I think it is sad as well. 

Maybe it is just a question of it being to scary to think that you as a doctor can get sick? 

I do have people in my life outside of uni though, so I'm covered. 
Which clearly works for some and not for others...
Just making sure we're talking about the same things. ;)

I think cancer to depression is a better analogy. Suicide is an action, cancer is a disease. 
I don't think you read the article, sorry. It argues that changing the speech around depression will make it easier for people to come forward and talk about their experience. So it's less about accuracy and more of removing blame that is often placed, overcompensating maybe in this case but it offers the hope of cure. People seeing you as fully better, because you know once you say suicide it's a forever in their mind and you need to move past it. It's like saying you're schizophrenic, it follows you. Maybe it should, maybe it shouldn't. People fear relapse and mental illness. But in some ways it makes it harder to recover. Maybe in some ways it makes it safer if you fall apart again, maybe.
I did. You can't engage in cancer; it happens *to* you, not *with* you as an active component. Depression happens to you, suicide is a decision. Semantically he's right. I agree that the attitude and language needs to change but how else do you describe it? Suicide doesn't just happen, you engage in it.

Perhaps saying someone engaged in suicide or took/tried to take their own life would be better. Before you leap down my throat, I'm not laying any blame on people for making that decision or suggesting there were other options that they were too selfish to consider. Just, semantically, it is a choice. Whether or not it is the only remaining choice for a desperate and hopeless victim is not in question (I absolutely believe that is how people feel when they take their own lives).

On a side note, relapse is an eventuality and shouldn't be feared. Chronic difficulties never truly go away and relapsing is natural. While frightening, these instances are a chance for you to prove that you've learned how to fight the difficulties that once plagued you, how to seek appropriate support and nurture yourself through whatever difficulties you're having. Again, having frank, non-judgemental conversations about relapse and prevention is very useful.

Nobody is ever truly healed or cured of mental health issues... You just learn how to make them strengths, not weaknesses.
I admit I didn't read the article. That's my bad. I'm responding to that quote though. The analogy is inaccurate and problematic in my opinion. I agree that people shouldn't be blamed for their mental illness any more than a cancer patient can be blamed for their cancer. But suicide isn't mental illness it's an act sometimes committed by people with mental illness. But people with cancer commit suicide too. With or without mental illness diagnosis.  That's all I'm saying. I noticed the quote because it's in the title of the post is all. 
First I'm not sure what about my comment made you feel I'd jump down your throat. I generally am interested in what others have to say, I find suicide philosophically interesting and don't think my opinion is the be all end all. 

If someone feels they only have one option left is it a choice? I'm not sure there is a right answer to that. I'd almost be tempted to use something more poetic like "embraced suicide" but that romanticizes it "succumbs to suicide"? Not sure but I do agree a semantic change would be helpful. 

 Your aside claim that those with chronic problems will always relapse, that they will always come back to wanting to die, to feeling this awful is harmful. While that is correct with say schizophrenia or bipolar, depression can achieve full remission and stay that way. This is harmful not only to the hopeless person seeking help but to those surrounding them who will never be able to see past that period of darkness given this rhetoric. 
I was arguing not for the accuracy of the analogy but for its impact. If you go beyond seeing suicide as an impulsive act (though I'm not ignoring some are) and look at people who are suicidal for a long period may feel fatally ill, and rather than calling it a choice or something you commit to but an illness you increase the chance of someone getting help. I'd imagine it's a rare case of suicide that happens after their first ideation. Maybe cancer isn't the perfect fit but the change in semantics can help people suffering see it as curable, or manageable and break out of the self hate and hopelessness that is a huge predictor for suicide. The argument isn't that it will help people understand suicide but that it will help people in that state feel less stigmatized and just plain wrong so they'll seek life saving help. 
Ah, nah... You didn't. My bad, probably shouldn't have said that!

It's hard to answer that but I feel that if you do take your own life you have made a decision. Even if you see no other option there is one... Deep down we all know that, it only seems pointless to consider that other option at the time.

It's not harmful to discuss with people the idea that they will begin to feel worse after a period of recovery. It happens. A small relapse doesn't need to drag you back down into the depths of despair you were once in, though, and promoting the idea that you can avoid a small bump (even if you have depression) leads to that bump becoming more extreme. If you believe you have failed rather than those feelings being an inevitable part of recovery you won't see them for what they are, which is life's natural ups and downs. Relapse isn't an ex-alcoholic getting tanked again, it's them having a few drinks. If you notice that it's unhelpful and you soothe and protect yourself with healthier things then you can continue your recovery. If you don't, then the relapse gets worse.

Depression, for example, involves a lot of unhelpful coping strategies; social withdrawal, self-medication, excessive rumination, catastrophising, etc.... If you notice that you have slipped back into doing them (relapse), then you can prevent it from getting worse. That's the hallmark of someone who is learning to manage their difficulties really well. Not someone who never falls, but someone who slips and gets back up!
But what is the cost of those other choices? The energy cost may be too high, or the chance to personal views that have brought comfort too scary or defining. It's hard to say. I know some would argue that you should try everything before making such a permanent decision but I ask, how much is reasonable to ask of them at that low? I really don't know. 

Oh for sure, I totally agree. I just think that given years of proper coping one could be considered "in remission", sure they're at greater risk than the population average but are they still ill? I'd argue not and to cling to the idea that they still are makes it more likely to return than thinking of it as a propensity for depression or anxiety. 

Brave of you to post.. your words of advice to those who may know people who SI I found were good.. I am glad that it has been 11 years since.
Thank you for posting. I hope that maybe next year I will have the confidence & strength you have shown here.
Very brave to post this. Thank you. 8 years free.
Thank you for posting. I have a 15yo stepdaughter that has been hospitalized for SI once, and has had issues since then.  I'm glad to hear you say that just letting them know you care & being there for them if they fall is the best approach.  That's sort of what I've been doing.  Being a stepfather to a teenage girl is awkward at best, and I do my best not to add stress to her life.  I've also found that there are surprisingly few resources for help on this matter.  She's taking antidepressants and we have a good counselor that she trusts a phone call away if she ever needs to reach out to someone aside from family.

Thanks again.  It's good to know there are people out there successfully living recovery from this.
Thank you.  I've been debating doing this for a couple years.
Thanks it mainly helps us to know we are not alone. 
Thank you and good work.  People generally don't understand the difficulties unless they have dealt with this issue. 
The taboo and shame make people not want to talk about it.  But discussing it is really the best thing to make progress.  I'm glad I could help.  There are forums for individuals that SI and for family/friends of those that go through this.  If you have a counselor you can trust then talking with them is probably the best course.  Good luck to you, her, and the rest of your family.
You are very welcome. On through the tough days and being able to try to help others from our own experiences is important and you did it.
Thank you.

They're making some big claims, which I can't help but feel for the time being skeptical about, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this research gets picked up and larger studies confirm the findings. Objective diagnostic test for depression would be huge...
This is awesome!  Thanks for sharing.
This is really cool but I don't understand why they chose RNA markers. Can somebody ELI5?
I assume they did compare and contrasts to find differences, and the RNA markers happened to define that
As you probably know, DNA is our genetic code, but many steps have to happen before that information can be used to run the body. Enzymes latch onto strands of DNA to make copies of certain small parts of it in the form of RNA which are then sent to another area of the cell that can use that RNA to make a protein. The proteins perform different functions in the body to communicate/preform processes etc. So the amount and types of RNA strands in your body can tell doctors what proteins your body is making, what those are doing and therefore what effect that would have on your health.



OCD isn't really all about order. I have Pure O which has nothing to do, well for me anyway, with order.
Narcolepsy isn't a mental disorder, it is an autoimmune disorder.
Theses are overly simplistic to the point of being entirely misrepresented. In addition to the points already made about OCD being far more complicated, and Narcolepsy not being a mental illness, representing BPD as literally sitting on a "border line" is just lazy. This boils complex issues down into an easily digestible image. 
>I have Pure O which has nothing to do, well for me anyway, with order.

What is that like? I've never heard of it.

I dunno, I think BPD may be "simple" in the picture, but it's true. You can snap at any second for no reason, like the ball in the picture could lose balance and then fall from an extreme height
Pure O is just what the OCD community call it, the proper term is Primarily Obsessive which means I get intrusive thoughts and fears that appear in my head. These thoughts are divided into;

* Violent
* Sexuality
* Religious
* Responsibility
* Relationship
* Health

These thoughts are always horrible to the sufferer. 

To combat these thoughts, I engage in mental rituals rather than physical rituals. I sometimes seek reassurance from other people online reassure me that the thoughts are not true as well as Research online as well and sometimes looks at the same articles more than once to reassure me my thoughts are false. 

To each sufferer with OCD, their theme is horrible obviously but Pure O is a lesser known form that can really be quite devastating onto their life. 

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primarily_Obsessional_OCD) is a wikipedia article with more detail on Primarily Obsessive OCD.
While that is true, that's still a extremely simplistic characterization. BPD is an extremely complex combination of behaviors that shouldn't be boiled down to "on the edge" for the sake of those dealing with the disorder.

I haven't experienced anything with OCD, but I sure am familiar with mental rituals like you mention. They have saved me from some pretty painful headspaces. What are yours like, do you have different rituals for different types of intrusive thoughts?
I have both bipolar and BPD and it's definitely "on the edge" to me
> that's still a extremely simplistic characterization

They're minimalist.  I don't think anyone on the trans boards actually thinks piles and piles of research can be boiled down to a square inside a circle.
My mental rituals include;

-Reassurance seeking 

-Repeating phrases in my head

-Mental analysis of memories ("Did I really do that? ") 

-Research online, I have looked at the same article more than once on OCD to make sure I actually have it as OCD sufferers often doubt they even have it. 

-although I'm primarily obsessive, I have a physical compulsion of clicking my fingers when an intrusive though enters my head. 

-Replacing Bad thoughts with good thoughts 

-Mental checking 

I don't really have multiple intrusive thoughts as mine generally focus on one theme (one I'd prefer to not say) so I usually use those compulsions for my intrusive thoughts.
I hope you don't mind me asking, how much does this aspect of your life interfere with social functionality? Or is it more like something you have to put up with in your own mind?
It can affect me in the sense that the thoughts in my head can make me feel depressed and so end up not going outside but they do not impair my ability to socialise.


that was beautiful and heartbreaking. What saddens me is I check all 9 of the boxes, its almost too much. The vast emptiness of when the little dog really hits home. The last part got to me.. all my life I have been told that I am 'amazing' with little kids and babies, on top of that; I am an artist. yeah.. 
Says I must login, how?
Aaaaaand now everyone thinks they have BPD.  Well, I guess that makes things easier for the Bipolar folks who have to deal with everyone popping up with "I went on WebMD and..." or "I had a bad day, so I must be..."

All joking aside, I love these pieces that provide insight in to various conditions, be they environmental, mental, or chemical ... 
People will have issues.  During the search to find the issue many will find something they may have.  I think it's important not to stigmatize people who search for their issues.  While I also think people shouldn't self diagnose, there's nothing wrong with people considering the possibility of having something.
 I think he's pointing out that personality disorders usually require the diagnosis of somewhat common traits. Virtually every personality disorder shares some similarities, so anyone reading up on them will of course start to think "holy crap, I do that!" 
Dear effexor, I dont like you and it took me one year for the physical withdrawls to stop and another year for my emotional wellbeing to heal kinda after taking you for 7 years. I developed some sort of PTSD from your horrific withdrawls and I feared antidepressents of any type for 5 years after stopping your evilness. Finally after much convincing and more decompensation from depression and anxiety I tryed Lexapro and Im doing better. Effexor you took years from my life, you changed my brain for the worst and you should die, not me or anyone else who crossed your hellish path. I wish you come with some type of informed consent about what you do to people when they breakup with you.
I'm on Effexor. You're scaring the shit outta me. 
I was on Effexor for about the same length of time. I felt the same way about withdrawal - one year to stop and another year to recover. That drug is the worst if it does not work for you. Getting off of it was a nightmare for me.
The Effexor withdrawal was so, so terrible and lasted so long! It made me feel *terrible*
Damn. I went cold turkey (not my choice) off Wellbutrin 10 days ago and no withdrawal. 

Reeeaally glad I've never been on Effexor! 
I was on Effexor for about a month, and couldn't stand the side effects. I was more anxious, and severely depressed. I had a panic attack in Walmart, and had to leave immediately. I couldn't stand to be around people. 
I also hate effexor. I can't stop taking it. The withdrawals are way too bad, I just cannot handle it. I want off of it but I really do not know what to do. 
christ, that makes me glad I came off it after 18 months. The only withdrawal I had thankfully was when I stupidly (by mistake) went cold turkey by not taking anything for about 5 days in a row. I've never experienced withdrawal symptoms from drugs before, and never want to again.

Only reason I came off it is because I started having really vivid dreams which meant I was exhausted all the time so the GP changed my medication
I didn't last 3 months on Effexor. I was put on it last June and suffered with side-effects until mid-August. Every day was hell.
OK Effexor let me be more frank. Saying I dont like you was nice and what I meant to say was I hate your guts.
Effexor helped my anxiety a lot but it made me soooo tired all the time. The withdrawal was bad for about a week for me. 

I was on lexapro as my first anti anxiety med. It worked great for a while  (I remember the day I realised it was working so vividly) but it's fairly common to build up a tolerance for it and it's effectiveness decreases. So just be on the lookout for that so you stay in a good place. Good luck!
I hear you. It's been almost a year that I got off Effexor and I'm only starting to feel better now. The withdrawals was the most brutal I had felt. Only upside to that medication was it controlling my bingeing and allowing me to lose weight. Still, wasn't worth the mental breakdown I had. 
My God! I nearly ran out last week! I worked the overnight shift about 2 weeks ago and my pharmacy was closed for the night.  I nearly had a panic attack and I made my husband drive around the Metro to the only pharmacy that was open in the state. Seriously, I cannot be upright when I go in withdrawal. I start to feel it about 36 hours after my last dose.
Lmao my psych put me on 150mg without even telling me what it was, let alone what the withdrawal could be like. I've never even googled it. It's a good job i couldn't care less what happens to me, I guess. Can't wait to see what happens when we have the conversation about it being 2 & a half months later and it's still not doing anything. 
My GP wanted me to take that took it one day and saw some story about and i Nope the f**k up of that and went back to Elavil.
Don't be scared. I'm a pharmacist, and I've been on Effexor for quite some time. Previous to that, I was on different SSRIs for over a decade.

Everyone will react to medications differently, especially psychotropic medications. Many, many people have the same horror stories about the straight SSRIs (Paxil [especially], Prozac, Luvox, Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro) as people do with the SNRIs (Effexor, Pristiq, Strattera, Cymbalta, etc). 

All of the SSRIs and SNRIs need to be tapered very slowly and carefully, many times over multiple months. Tapering and discontinuing some of the older antidepressants, like tricyclics (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, etc), tends to be "easier" and faster to accomplish. 

Not everyone is going to experience the same side effects and tapering issues as OP, and the same side effects and tapering issues are possible with Lexapro that someone mentioned. Keys to remember: everyone will react differently, and tapering needs to be done very slowly. 
The makers say it only happens to a few people.
I took effexor for a few years. It was making me super tired all the time so I stopped. I had pretty bad vertigo for about a week but other than that it wasn't too bad. 
Sure was a nightmare. I had night terrors and sleep paralysis. I was literally screaming in my sleep, my daughter had to shake me and slap me to get me to wake up one night.
I wasn't warned about the extreme withdrawal. If I forget to take it, within 6 hours I'm immobilised by the withdrawal symptoms. 

I split my dose so I take half in the morning and half at night, for some reason that helps. I'm on the max dosage so I'm completely fucked if I ever want to come off of it.
Tons of teddy bears to hug you for getting through it.
Currently on Wellbutrin, how was your experience with it?  
Yeah back when I was taking it I knew that I had to someday stop but couldnt because I found out how bad it was to stop so I continued to take it years longer than I wanted to. Even after I lost my insurance I was willing to pay 300.00 a month to keep taking it. I ended up having to quit another job later on and finally started tapering myself off and had horrible month at least. Then when I found a job I could only work graveyard shift part time at that because it kept me away from people because I could not handle interactions as I felt like I was going crazy. I guess your life has to be ready for you to quit and quit very slowly and do your research as to what may help.
I've read that a few doses of welbutrin (I think) at the end of tapering effexor can significantly help with the withdrawal symptoms. 
Yeah lm on a low dose of Lexapro, 10 mg  and I could probably benefit  from an increase but Im too afraid to increase. I may want to see an actual psychiatrist  for medication management instead of my general primary doctor. Thank you!
Those dummies! You were smart.
This comment made me feel better- I like Effexor, I'm aware of the withdrawal symptoms since I forget to take them every once and a while and they're horrible but when I take it regularly I'm way better than I used to be. 

Almost lost it on regular SSRIs though. Different strokes for different folks I guess? 
Nothing to be frightened of from experts
I'm on effexor now.  It was working pretty well with almkst no side effect, until about a month ago when my doctor decided to increase my dose.  Now I'm tired all the time, randomly get bad vertigo, and am more depressed than I've been in a while.  
I feel you. Well if you ever want to stop there are lots of advice how to do that on the internet. You will have to gently taper yourself off, I mean gently. If you ask the doctors how to taper off they will have you taper too quickly. Im very upset at this medication for doing this to people. No one was warned about the withdrawls and I feel like it should be the first thing the prescriber says , I think its called informed consent. Yes other SSRI's can do the same thing but effexor withdrawls are very profound and debilitating for some people. Had I known I would have said, no thank you, can we try a different medication?
That's incredibly nice, thank you! Luckily that was when I was 22, 27 now so it's now a faint nightmare, ha! Thank you again. 
I LOVE it! It's a nice kick of energy.
Im glad to know about that. Thanks.
If it was working, why did your doc raise the dose? Maybe it's worth reducing? Some of the side effects for me decreased once I reduced my dose.
I had always been on the lowest dose. I react pretty quickly to medication so most of my meds are super low doses. 
I was ok when I was on somewhat a lower dose of 37.5 mg or even 75mg but my doctor kept increasing the dose on me. I think she was looking for a miracle by doing that. I dont know why but I had the vertigo and other side effects increased and also I became super impulsive and did some very embarrassing things.
It was 5 years ago for me as well so now I feel very normal now but I got reminded of the ordeal and felt like telling effexor off. :)
I'm pretty sure I'm going through an episode right now (minor one at least) so I'm not positive it's working at the moment. But it's a hell of a lot better than Effexor!! My psychiatrist may increase it.
Seriously, screw that medication. I was put on 300mg to start and that seemed very off to me. 

Dear Effexor, 
Stay the fuck away from me 
When I'm upset or really anxious I always have the urge to delete all of my social media accounts and mute all of my text/chat notifications. This happens especially after I post/text something, I'm always really nervous at how other people will respond to it so I put my phone on "Do Not Disturb" and delete all of my sns apps out of fear. Does anyone else do something similar?
Yes! In my experience, this is because getting rid of social media is a very easy way to isolate myself. In real life, you don't get the instant gratification that you do when you delete your Facebook or whatever else you use. I used to delete my whole account earlier, but eventually I'd feel clueless and out of touch so I'd re-make my profiles. Now, I just delete the apps on my phone. That way, I get to stay away from social media as long as I want to, I don't draw any attention from people because nobody knows I've deleted the app and when I want to get back, all I have to do is download and sign in.
I just deleted my Facebook, part of it could have been a manic decision, but I really feel like Facebook drags me down more so than real life. Everyone is looking for an excuse to be upset on there, it's truly exhausting. 
I went through a severe mental health crisis late last year and deleted everything except Reddit.

It's honestly been incredibly freeing. I don't miss social media. I realized how much time I spent online dicking around, and how much freer I am without being caught up in everyone else's rat race/drama. 

I also had a problem of oversharing when going through a rough time, and then would get high anxiety over what I shared and who saw it. Now, not so much. If I'm going through something and need to tell someone, I call or text. Random social media acquaintances don't need to know that I went to the gym today, much less that I'm struggling with my anxiety and depression.

Take a break from some of the bigger sites, see how you feel. You can always leave FB Messenger active, even with your profile deactivated, if you really need to stay in touch with FB people.
Exactly!  I make a typo and my gut reaction is "well burn it all down. You are ruined."
I do, constantly. I have social anxiety and depression issues and visiting social media, Facebook especially. Seeing others out there enjoying their lives when I feel unable to is upsetting, so I isolate myself and cut myself off. I'm aware of the damage I'm doing​ to myself socially and emotionally but it feels like self preservation. It's a habit I wish I knew how to break. I miss friendship and the company of others.
I seem to wipe my twitter and facebook posts once or twice every year. 
I doooo! I'll usually post something, then immediately delete it. 
I uninstalled FB app a week or so ago and for the first couple days it was a bit hard, but now I don't miss it. I have FB msng because I still want to talk to some friends, but honestly having FB no longer daily in my life has made me less stressed. I won't delete my profile though because I have so many pictures and stuff.
I deleted my Facebook and Snapchat which I was on allthetime and only kept Instagram and just recently joined Reddit. Definitely increased my mental health by at least 25% 

I like having one (at least) for sure way where I can reach people/can be reached. Cause just in case ya know and also support system 
I suggest instead of deleting social media, come chat someplace where you are anonymous and can say whatever you feel like saying. Anyone struggling with disordered loved ones or having a disorder yourself, feel free to join my discord which is about mental health and having open and frank discussions about how it affects us. https://discord.gg/h3pdMMK
Is there a way to wipe everything on an established profile and start over without having to remake it? 
I can't remember what I use for FB but for Twitter I use Deletter for Android. 

Facebook is more tedious iirc because it uses the activity log which sometimes requires you to manually select the next page. 
Thanks, doll
My wife has had mental health issues since we started dating. She told me she had them before we started dating but I gave her a chance and while the cutting and breakdowns were tough to deal with she was great when we was healthy. 


We dated for 2 years, engaged for 1, then got married. Through this entire time we had no trouble holding a full time job, she switched more often than "normal" but on good terms and usually had another one lined up before she quit. 

A year after we got married we bought a house and with in weeks of moving in I got a new job paying over twice what we were making together. 

My wife was having a harder time with work and she said she felt like if she took time off of work and focused on therapy that she could make big strides in her recovery.

I agreed​ that she could take a year off to work on therapy.

That was 5 years ago, in the last 5 years she's made about $5,000, doesn't clean the house in the least (rotting food and trash are piled to the level of the bed on her side of the bed, I sleep on the couch to not have to smell that)

She cooks on occasion but no more than 2 times a week. 

She has made progress in that are doesn't cut or do much self harm anymore but we had to cancel her therapist because it was $60 a visit and 4 to 5 visit a month. She won't try a therapist in my insurance Network because it takes her a long time to get comfortable.

We're not struggling financially but things like vacations and a second car are beyond us. 

I clean about 10 hours a week plus work about 50 hours a week. 

I relax/ ignore the problems​ in my life by using flight simulator​s on my computer. I have always wanted to get my pilots license and until my wife starts pulling her weight financially​ that is impossible.

When my wife is healthy we spend a lot of time together outside or window shopping etc.

However when she is not doing well I have no more patience to handle it. So I end up shutting down and just burying myself in my hobbies. 

I know she deserves better but then so do I, I love her dearly and want to see her happy but how much of my own happiness do I sacrifice, how long do I put up with someone who I honestly feel like has played me to keep from working? 

I want to have kids and am 32 so it's getting to be a point where I need to know if she's even going to be stable enough in both mental and financial aspects​ to take that plunge, at what point do I just cut my losses?
At some point in your life in a situation you have to put the love for your Wife to one side and stop enabling her. I know this is hard but she is going down hill and won't get better until her security rug,you, decided enough is enough.

Tough love is needed mate, take the lead, set the ultimatums and hopefully she will get the help that needed.

You can't sleep in your bed because she has food all over the place, not cool mate, I know you love her, but grow a pair of balls and get her help , she will probably hate you but you've got to sort this out cause she won't

Best of luck, it's hard but you got to sort this.
I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're in. It sounds as though you've tried to be very patient and accommodating as you made efforts to give your wife an opportunity to work on herself.

While I agree that it sounds as though your wife needs continued mental health treatment, I'd consider whether it might be the right time for *you* to start seeing your own mental health professional. Given the situation you described, the answer to your question ("at what point do I cut my losses?") is only something you can really answer, as you're the only one who really knows all the factors at play. 

I realize that might not be the kind of input you were hoping for but I encourage you not to underestimate what you and an objective professional could accomplish together in exploring for the answer to your question. Not to mention this professional could help address other areas of concern that are relevant to your post  (i.e., communication, limit setting, problem solving, etc).

Best wishes.
5 weeks is a good amount of "me time" 5 months is a reasonable amount of time to get life together. 5 years? 
Bruh, that's a lifestyle
I disagree with this. Like other parts of life, mental illness doesn't work on a schedule. Recovery for some takes months and for others it can take years.
Maybe your right. But my time is finite. Unfortunately, I'm gonna cut bait and recast. Maybe that makes me a selfish person
I've been struggling with depression for 14 years, and the last 6 months have been better than I've ever been with taking care of myself.

But on days (I do this maybe around 1 in 7-10 days) after I spend the day exercising, eating really healthy, being productive, learning something new, getting good sleep, and not drinking (well, maybe 1 or 2 beers compared to my usual 3-6), I wake up but feel myself quickly spiralling out of control to being very depressed. I've noticed this very consistently, it's definitely a pattern.

Anyone else experience this?
It sounds like you might have a drinking problem, if you are drinking every day.  If you drink less on certain days, it may be the withdrawal kicking in.  I self medicated for years, and when I finally gave up drinking and drugging for good, I finally remembered what it is like to feel "normal" again.  Are you under a doctors care for your depression?
Also, make sure you are hydrated enough.  With all that exercise and added alcohol, you may simply need to drink more water. Also, try not drinking alcohol for a few weeks and see if it helps!  Can't hurt!

edited to add:  overcoming depression is hard, great work trying to take care of yourself!  at this point, it may be a matter of tweaking little things, instead of major changes.  hang in there!
It could be something about the super healthy/productive days since the shitty days tend to follow them. Possibilities (some already mentioned by others): 

-Sleep is impacted -- because of exercising late the day before, or even the excitement of a really good day keeping you awake
-Dehydration -- from more exercise, change in eating/drinking habits, and generally being more active
-Energy depletion -- on the good day you're getting shit done so you do a lot more than you're mind/body is used to. You may keep going even after you're a bit exhausted because you're on a roll but it's eating into energy reserves for the next day. So you wake up feeling no energy or will power to get started.
-Disappointment -- After doing a bunch of healthy stuff and feeling like you're doing really well you might expect that you're emotions will stay good/fulfilled. When there's a dip in feeling good (even just tired) it can seem like all the effort put in was a waste. Who could sustain it forever if taking a slight pause lets the good feeling disappear. The disappointment can zap motivation and desire to keep doing stuff.

Probably other possibilities but those are what came to mind!
Yes... I've recently started mountain biking and of course that adds to me being sore and stiff in the morning, but also just have been having a general shitty feeling each morning. Don't know what that is 
I get this too. I think that it is a kind of emotional hangover. 

I will have one day that I'm really proud of myself, and feel kind of high on the whole self-care thing. I start thinking about how great my life could be if I keep it up. I get attached to what is really a fantasy version of my life. 

Then, I wake up the next day and realize that I'm still the same person I've been for decades. It hits me that one day didn't change anything in the long run. It feels like the work to keep it up would be impossible. It feels like even if I did keep it up, it wouldn't have the effect I had convinced myself it would. 

Part of it, I believe, is the way our brains work. When we think, it creates neural pathways and so we are more likely to think similar thoughts in the future. Depression creates millions of "negative thought" neural connections. So in a way, depression is a negative thinking pattern we've hardwired into ourselves. So after the 'reset' of sleeping, we return to our normal state of disappointment in ourselves and our lives. There are a few ways to rewire those thought patterns - forcing yourself to repeatedly build more positive connections so the old negative ones die out (CBT is built on this in a lot of ways), drugs/medications, putting yourself into new and different environments in which your old thought patterns don't really apply (so you *have* to form new neural pathways because of all the new inputs and situations you aren't familiar enough with to live on mental cruise control), etc. 
I was under a doctor's care until I moved cities 10 months ago. I guess the withdrawal theory makes sense.
I think the disappointment thing kind of hits home for me. Probably a bit of dehydration too. Thanks for putting these ideas out.
Get back to the doctor!! Seriously, treatment works. No need suffer from untreated mental ailments in 2017.
Thanks, I need a bit of a kick in the ass. I know I need to go back but it helps having others tell ya.
I keep on forgetting certain things. Like, when I'm talking to my family about what we're having for dinner, I'll ask them, then 10 seconds later I think "Oh! I came out here to ask what/when's dinner". So I ask them the exact same question, completely forgetting that I asked just 5-10 seconds ago.


Also, I cannot read books. It's (mostly, not always) fine when I'm reading things online, but when I read a book, I completely 100% forget what I had just read. And I absolutely hate that, because there are a few books that I would absolutely LOVE to read as a physical copy. 

Does anybody know anything to 'cure' or 'help' this? Anybody else experience this too? Thank you :)
Usually this is related to attention. Do you feel like you're 'in your own head' a lot? The other thing that commonly does this is anxiety. In either case training your mind can strengthen it. Meditation and yoga are good. Exercise and eliminating stimulants (like caffeine, cocaine, etc.) can help so you're not hypervigilantly attending to every which thing. 
Ever been tested for ADD?
Just curious, but are you distracted when you ask these questions? I know sometimes I'll just be talking and not paying attention to a word I'm saying because my mind is off somewhere else.
Bump, also experiencing this.
I'm in my 30's and experience this too. I listen to audiobooks but often find that 5 minutes just went by and I missed the whole point because I was thinking about what's for dinner. I really have to focus on movies or the plot gets muddy quickly. Real books? I may have read 4 or 5 total my whole life. However, I love Reddit. It's like the fast food version of reading. I get in and get out. I don't know what would fix it since I can't take uppers due to having schizoaffective disorder. They cause mania which causes me to spend thousands of dollars out of..you guessed it..boredom! Oh, and I was diagnosed ADD all through school. 
I had this issue when I was at my most anxious. I believe what I was experiencing was due to anxiety-it went away after anxiety meds. 
I second (or third?) the ADD suggestion. My friend used to do this a lot, and it was SO annoying. It basically felt like he didn't care enough about you to listen even though he's a lovely guy. He has been much better since he was diagnosed with adult ADD and started treatment. 
Stimulations help me with my ADD.  
>  caffeine, cocaine, etc

Wow, that went south real quick. I feel like I have no control over my mind, so not. I don't feel like I'm in my own head.


My parents told me that I'm diagnosed with it, so yeah.
about 90% of it atleast I'm sure I was zoning out of. At school I'll start to read, then a few lines in I'll just day dream and my vision will go all unfocused, but my eyes will keep on moving as if I WERE reading, but I'm not
I do that with movies too. 95% of the film I can focus, but sometimes I'll just drift off, usually thinking about my girlfriend.
[deleted]
Well there's your answer.
[deleted]
Sounds like some Donnie Darko shit. 
Not really, no
I want to die. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt this way. I don’t feel anything anymore. I’m not sad or angry or upset or scared or bored. I’m empty and I want to kill myself. It’s not an edgy teenager line, I really feel this is the best decision and course for my life to follow. Death speaks to me, life does not. But I said I would keep on loving you and when I said that, I meant that I’d love you forever. So I can’t go – not yet. But I really want to. In this murky, dull afternoon I want nothing more than nothingness. I want to be over. I want life to be finished for me. Not because I don’t love you or I can’t feel happiness, but because I feel this is the right and only choice for me. I’ve always been alien to this world, always felt I don’t belong. And you will never understand that and you will never understand me. I don’t want to cry in bed anymore because I know you don’t truly care about me. There is no caring in this world, there is no love. There’s only pretence, falsity and lies. I don’t care if you think it’s different, you’re just lying to yourself. If you take a hard good look in the mirror and you’re scarily honest with yourself you’ll see this too. I just want to keep on loving you – but I want to sleep more. Bring to me that sweet, eternal sleep that no love can outweigh. All I want is to rest. Nothingness is the only reality, everything else is a lie and I want to put an end to it. Love does not exist, it is a wilful figment of our imagination and I don’t like daydreaming a better future from within a prison. I can taste the cold steel of this jail everytime the bitter-acid flavor of beer burns and streams down my throat. If only poison can come down these air pipes then I want to shut them down for good. Bind them together so that no love, but also no pain can pierce through anymore. I want death, my one, my everything, my only truth and friend in this world. Please take me.

My name is Jeremiah. I know that feel.
Sorry you feel like shit.
That sucks. I can't say I know what you're going through, but I feel that I can say you won't always feel this way. 

Take a journey, escape, try some adventure, travel to a new country. Do ANYTHING that you never would have done until right now.

That dark place that your in is your depression suffocating you so that you don't see the light that can be in your life. It can be exhausting to fight those thoughts all the time but you are loved and the world would be a sadder place if you were to leave it too soon. Depression controls the way we look at the world and at ourselves, don't let it win. You are worth more than that! Please hold on and find a helping hand to guide you out of the darkness. My thoughts are with you Xx
Please don't die! Your friends and family will be melancholy for years to come! I know for sure, that there are people out there that love you! 
i can't say that i know exactly what you're going through because i'm not you; however, I have experienced extreme depression for very long periods on and off for about 7-8 years now. I wanted to kill myself so many time. I never had a date planned for suicide or anything. I just figured that on the right day I'd just know it's time to end it. I knew exactly how I was going to commit suicide. i'm going to be a bit morbid with you so in hopes that maybe you might relate to what I went through and that you'll see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I knew that I was going to end my life using carbon monoxide and that i'd drive my car far into a logging road and park off to the side to do it. perhaps you already know how this is done, if not, I'm not going to tell you how to do it. 

anyways as you can see I had it all thought out, just so that when the right day came I wouldn't have to think too much about it and I could just take off. for the last 2 and a half years I have been trying different medications. i'm one of the unlucky ones who don't have any luck and pretty much become a lab rat. I used to be afraid of and very against medication and thought i'd never take it. i was wrong. I have been on 16 different medications and have only recently found medication that helps. many people find the right medication much faster, and a lot of people get lucky with SSRIs which are the first line treatment for depression.

anyways, I just want you to know that I have suffered tremendously with anxiety and depression for about 7-8 years, and it wasn't until about 6 months ago that I was diagnosed with bipolar ii disorder with social phobia. the reason it took so long is that I was reluctant to seek help because i was against drugs. if you seek help now, you can save so much time and i promise you, you will get better. just don't give up. there are a lot of great things you need to experience in life, try not to focus only on the bad. i know that's far from easy, but it's possible. 

I'm not gonna lie, you may still deal with depression for a long time, but I promise that the severity can be changed quite dramatically pretty quickly with help. I still struggle with depression, but I haven't had a true suicidal thought for at least a year now, maybe more.

I hope this message helps you out. I know i talk a lot about myself, and that this is meant to be about you, but i just figured that it may make you feel less alone hearing someone else's story and seeing that i have improved that you will believe in yourself. i hope you'll get through these dark times and come out of it stronger and happy again.
Please don't. Please stick it out. We can stick it out together 
You dont sound like you have a clear head at all, you come across like you are all messed up about something and confused. Dont do anything stupid. You might feel this way now, but that dosent mean you will always feel that way.
You don't really want to die.
How old are you? 

I really wish that there were people who'd rush home from an important event to save a person drowning in anxiety.  I hope this inspires someone to feel for someone with anxiety.
