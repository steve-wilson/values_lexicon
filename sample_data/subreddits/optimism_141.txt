I don't care about the grammar at all.  That was fabulous!
Are there grammar nazis in this sub?
Adorable.  Thanks for this.  :)

(shush grammar)

I would love for this to be true, but it seems like we may have to wait a bit longer than 2020.
Have to agree. Peace will not come through political or technological means. As long as humans have selfishness and conflict in their minds and hearts there will be selfishness and conflict in the world. It's fundamentally an individual inner change, and you cannot control this in others, particularly en masse. People will have to willingly change themselves and this can only happen very gradually. It *is* happening, but at a glacial pace. And, unfortunately, those in power are the least motivated to change, which substantially inhibits anything resembling large scale progress.

Eight years will not see any significant change on this fundamental level. Maybe 80. Or more likely 800. And I think I'm actually being optimistic here. That infographic is pure fantasy.

Nothing wrong with fantasizing though...
I just got here and can't read anything. Thanks! 
I second that!
Or change the transparency settings everything is impossible to read!
We should get other people involved and maybe change up some things like the background so text is readable.  The world could use some optimism!
> the background so text is readable.

I second this notion.
I like your attitude!  And, I agree.
Unfortunately, don't have the time to dedicate to fixing this space up & keeping it active.  
Will definitely post & join in conversations, though!
I have time to work on this sub, if someone wants to make me a mod! I also help mod /r/tricking
Yea, it's better than it was.
I have spent most of middle school up until now, going in to be a junior in high school this year, thinking about death and whether there is life after death. I was severely depressed however was not diagnosed medically. So as of today, I have found a way to avoid the countless sleepless nights and lost concentration. Life is just to amazing to be thinking about death. just typing this brings a tear of joy. Today, and for the rest of my life, Life is good.
People always say things like 'life is short, don't waste any time worrying about how life is short'.  That's not easy to visualize for me, though, since life is, actually pretty long - it's the longest thing that any of us will be aware of, really.  
So, I like to put it in context of something easier to visualize.  Imagine you're on a 1 week vacation.  You've only got one week, then back to school/work/whatever.  You could choose to spend that week worrying about going back to school/work/whatever when it's over -or- you can spend that week forgetting about the fact that it's going to end some day.  It's going to end either way.  You're going back to work or school.  Why not make the most of the time off that you've got, while you've got it? 
I remember being paralyzed by such fear, from the time I was young (around 7), through high school. For me, it was the realization that what I was really scared of was dread, that feeling of being trapped in a coffin or seeing nothing forever. But, the realization that that requires actual cognition to perceive (something I won't have when dead, lulz) allowed me to get over it.

TL;DR: What you won't perceive cant scare ya. And yeah, life is fucking  incredible. Enjoy the rest of high school, [fastpat6](http://www.reddit.com/user/fastpat6). 
"I have found a way to avoid.."
Please share? I'd appreciate some advice thanks! 
Life is to be experienced! We know of our shortcomings so we can make the most of what we can.
That only works assuming you have 'time off'. With responsibilities, or the onset of responsibilities from change you lose that freedom to 'make the most' of it in a meaningful way. I suppose what you value as meaningful is important though.
Ugh, look at me bringing pessimism into this place.
Definitely agree that it comes down to what you value as meaningful :-)  
I'm well into a life of responsibilities.  I'm 48 years old - 3 kids, 2 dogs, 3 cats, mortgage, etc & just went through a period where my husband & I both lost our jobs at once, after working there 17 years & 22 years respectively.  
We had months of worrisome unemployment during a job search in an employment market that is 100% different than the last time either of us looked for work.  And now we're adjusting to new work schedules & longer commutes that truly restrict the time we have to spend physically with each other and doing the things we enjoy (after doing the things we have to do).  
But, still - isn't it wonderful to have each other through it all?  And, how exciting to face these challenges & dive into new workplace environments!  And what a great opportunity for our kids to try on some independence and for all of us to discover what we can do to make things run more smoothly in our home!  
And, oh, that time that we do have together - it's so much more beautiful because it is precious & rare!



there's a lot of truth to this.

even in the most horrible circumstances (the most obvious example in history might be the holocaust) there are usually people that want to help rather than go along with it.

Wow, beautiful!
Thank you! I have plenty more [here](https://www.facebook.com/marcusjehrlanderphoto). 
Cannot see any post properly
Moderators ,are you listening?
[They are asleep. Quickly post pictures of dancing wizards!](http://imgur.com/1WMntac)
Yeah, it is a bit hard to read. Text links are even worse.

Kind of a pretty background, but is there not some way to keep it from conflicting, increase the contrast, or make it so the foreground of posts is not transparent?
Agreed, it's extremely hard to read.
I agree.  It's very hard to see the text of a post.
It's pretty bad.
Yeah, any text that goes over the trees is more or less unreadable.... which means a big chunk of the screen.
That's all, love you guys (:
I feel ya. Stuck in the same boat.

I spend a lot of time absorbing news and current events, and just the reality of it all can be crushing. 

I really appreciate people's efforts to post lighter topic, things to be optimistic about, things to feel good about.

Cheers :)

I definitely agree and I have found my own path of happiness through my own ways and I believe the book Stop Thinking, Start Living by Richard Carlson is what helped me to become self aware and tap into my healthy functioning. 



Trash cans!  If you consider a trash can half empty isn't that more optimistic than thinking of it as half full?
Hmm.... Interesting thought. I like it.
Think of all of the fun you had using the things or eating the things that made all of that trash!  
Or, think of how much cleaner the world is around the trash can, since the trash can is half full :-) 
A trash can made out of glass? 
That could be true for other stuff too... like a glass half full of cough syrup, or raw eggs, or human feces. Those are things I would like out of my glass, please! 
I would like your glass emptied then carried past the recycling bin right to the dumpster for forever disposal, please!

Congrats! But I don't feel like this sub is the right place for this. 
I really wasn't sure where to post it. It gives me a lot of optimism.
I am a Sophmore in high school. I have few friends, but that's okay. My head tilts naturally to the right, I have weird hair, and I have a mole on my face. But that's okay. I am a very moody person whose moods come and go as quickly as the summer breeze. But that's okay. I used to suffer from depression because of my lack of friends until I realized something. You don't have to be popular or have everything you want to be happy. The things that make life worth living are the moments. Some are good, some are bad. But even during the bad ones, life goes on. You can choose to live in a sad state of depression all the time and become bored with life and grow complacent or you can choose to live life to the fullest. You can choose to have a happy life. You don't need lots of friends or money. A few close friends are a lot better than a bunch of acquaintances. Choose to live life for the moments. Choose to look at the sun rather than the shadows. Come out of the shell. Smile a bit. People will always try to hurt you. Instead of hurting others, do things that are mutually beneficial. Because helping others makes life worth living. And you only have one life. So choose to live it well. Choose to love.
Very inspirational attitude.
You're attitude's awesome
>And you only have one life. So choose to live it well.

Yolo

damn straight!
But, on July 17th, I'll have been seizure free for 7 months and my life is getting back on track thanks to my family, boyfriend, best friend and my current hobby, judo. :)
oh NICE (Y)!!!

and i cnt help but being grateful for the little  things like seeing and hands and feet and motor function and speaking etc...

(epileptic here too)
Those aren't the greatest things to think about when I've been seizure free long enough to start doing again but hey, I agree
i know..but not often do non-epileptic realise how important it all is and how easy it is to lose it all. when ive lost it (partially) i just realise how important it is to me.

didnt mean to offend, please disregard. i dont want to tread sensitive issues. we all deal with epilepsy differently, that's something i've learnt at least.

My personal outlook on life when i'm down in the dumps
Things could always be worse, I could have Ebola. unless I already have Ebola in which case I'm pretty screwed
wise words my friend.
This is one of the things I love about this subreddit. We can post things like this just to brighten somebody's day. When I resolved to be an optimist, this is exactly the kind of thing that I wished everyone would participate in.

Posting in r/optimism does have benefits - upvoted!
Well this seems like a great place to share my own recent experience of being a nice guy.

In a similar vein, there's this awesome girl (shares common interests, awesome personality, but the first thing to notice is that she's very pretty) that I met in one of my classes.  I'm generally an unattractive, socially awkward guy, though I'm almost always helpful and nice to other people.  I get along with most people, but it's often superficial: friendship as far as the classroom or job space, never really hanging out with anyone beyond what's necessary.  Sure, I'll see people from former classes in the halls and have the standard, "hey, how have you been?  How far along until graduation?" etc., but as soon as I'm off campus, there's nothing.

Anyways, it's a small class (like 10 people), all people I've never met before, first meeting there's a big table we're all sitting at, plenty of open seats between us (who doesn't love their personal space?) and she sits right next to me.  The only reason I even thought she would do that is because she didn't want to get hit on by any of the other guys there.  She later singled me out as the person to keep her company on one of her breaks (it's culinary school, kitchen breaks are basically on your own terms when you have the time).  We had a good conversation, then had more breaks together, asked her to add me as a friend on facebook to chat some more because I enjoyed our conversations (adding classmates and coworkers on facebook isn't something I do often, as I keep basically close friends on it), and she did.  I recently asked her why she picked me out of everyone, and she said it's because she quickly realized that I was the only guy in the class who wasn't a douchebag.  Being a nice guy has never really done anything for me apart from getting me used (cash loans, rides, borrow cell phone, etc.), but finally, someone who enjoys my company (with no ulterior motive) because I'm a nice guy, despite my awkwardness and looks.

TL;DR: pretty and interesting girl likes me because I'm a good person; never asked for anything from me except my company.
Thank you! ;)
Well I'm happy for you! It always gets depressing when being a good person never seems to bring anything good to you. Well I hope you and this girl are friends (or more) for a good amount of time.

She seems like someone with the right kind of priorities, ;)


I agree with the general thrust of the video. Conditions are improving worldwide and one can see that by taking an historical perspective. Thanks for posting!
From my facebook earlier tonight:

"I BEG YOUR PARDON, but I just want to interrupt the silence tonight with a quick emotional outbreak to anybody that would read it:

I love it when people look at me and think I'm nuts. I have made a lot of people in my life laugh out loud because of how devoted I was to seeing the world as a beautiful, positive place. Subsequently, I made them roll around on the floor when I told them that they are beautiful and that they have something to give back to the world. And the same folks are dumbfounded, and never believe me, when I finally tell them that I think I am truly beautiful and that I am worth somebody's time. Because "How could this pansy make a difference in MY life?"

But this is no laughing matter. I am on a quest of self discovery and a search through my mind and body for personal integrity. It's a life that many choose never to face because they are too afraid of what they might find. I have found beauty in the greatest disasters in history, and I have shed tears of amazement at the sight of a mere ant pushing its way up a tiny pile of dirt. Just because some people see the world as a cold, dark, and hideous place where we all harm one another doesn't mean that it's all like that. And just because some folks think that their lives are meaningless doesn't mean that I treat mine with that same sort of indifference and disrespect. I also understand that not everything is inherently good in the world either.

But what I'll never do again is focus my attention on those bad parts. Because I don't have time for that!! I am too busy healing to notice when somebody hurts me. I am too busy laughing when somebody else is fearful. And I am too tired of trying to convince dubious people my age that we are all in this together and that we all are significant, and that the world is a wide, bright, and extraordinary place to be alive right now.

I am not a joke. I am not retarded. I am not crazy. I am the happiest person I know. I am an overwhelmingly positive spirit that cannot be broken or hurt. To get to know a person like me better, all you need to do is open yourself up to me and to the idea of being happy. I could say so much more and talk about it forever. But I've already said everything that needs to be said for anybody to understand who I truly am at a base level.

That's all."
What a fantastically affirming sentiment-- I enjoyed reading this and am happy you feel this way. One thing that I have told others as a kind of motto for myself is "assume good intentions", in that I so often see arguments get sparked and people get bent out of shape because they attribute malicious intent to others. While obviously you don't want to go around waving wads of money and getting into cars with strangers and whatever, all those safety considerations, it seems that in the majority of cases (family, friends, colleagues, etc.) a better outcome can be brought forth simply by avoiding the trap of assuming that the reason someone is doing something is to be bad or harmful. What you've said seems kind of similar in that you are consciously choosing to attend to positive aspects of your world and ignore or dismiss things that, dwelling on, will make you unhappy. It's important to consider the broader impact that the behavior you've described can have, in that by keeping yourself from becoming unhappy in as many cases as possible, you are increasing the happiness in the world-- others will see that, and they will be affected by it, regardless of whether they find it strange or comical. 
I just found a new blog that might be of interest to this sub. The Intelligent Optimist's editor Jurriaan Kamp just started a new blog that outlines the benefits of optimism.

There aren't many posts yet, but the newest one I found really interesting, on Pollyanna and why saying she wasn't really an optimist- http://whyoptimism.com/optimism/2013/10/18/pollyanna-was-not-an-optimist-and-why-optimism-is-the-best-strategy/

I liked it and thought I'd share!


Can I ask a favor of you guys? Could you please send pictures/drawings/words of encouragement/etc to my cousin, who has finally decided ON HIS OWN to go to rehab after years of drug abuse? We have hope that this is really his chance to clean the fuck up and be someone his daughter can be proud of. No names, no return addresses. Please no vulgarity, nudity, money, or objects of any kind. Just anonymous little notes of encouragement. Please PM me for the address of the facility he is in.
		


Thank you so much, you guys. I really mean it. It will only take you a second and a stamp.



**EDIT:** It's come to my attention that I need to clarify that I am not asking for letters or people's stories about their own addiction/their friend's addiction/etc. Literally just shitty drawings of dinosaurs or a print out of LeVar Burton or a blank card with the words, "Great job!" on the inside.
So the girl I've liked since 5th grade (she's also my best friend) got in a relationship with a guy that I do not like about 5 months ago. When it happened, I went into a depression. And since that time, I've sunk in and out of the same depression. But just recently I've discovered how stupid I've been. I still like her, but I have been depending on her for my happiness. My happiness shouldn't depend on other people because they do things that hurt. I should love people, but not depend on them for happiness. Through this time period of the relationship, I have focused on the fact that I want it to end, not that she's probably the happiest she's been in her life. Now I will not depend on others for happiness, I will simply love them and not expect them to be perfect and to love me as well.

P.S. However, if her boyfriend ever hurts her, I'm still going to hurt him.
You've already learned the most valuable lesson that I gained from a heavy year of depression. "I should love people, but not depend on them for happiness." Makes me smile just reading that. You go, dude. 


Met with my new advisor, and although it's only associates degrees, I'm officially going for a double program for graphic design and web design.  Just waiting on credit transfer reviews and I'm set!  I couldn't be more excited!
Go for it.

But I would balance additional education with practical experience.

Grow your portfolio, that is very important in your field.

Join a local user group, so you can see what education and lessons they learned.
I've actually already done work in the field.  I was hired based on a random project I did for them out of curiosity to see if I could, and the employer assumed I had the school.  I have several marketing and promotional pieces that have been published and are currently being distributed.  It's always been somewhat of a passion of mine.  :]
Awesome, good luck!

Yahuh.

Yesterday my day was brightened when I was stopped at the traffic lights and watched your average joe walking home with a big pizza and grin the size of King Kong on his face.
It just made me feel so oddly overwhelmed with happiness!
Yeah!

Today's been really good, I've been arguing less with my boyfriend by talking more and I've managed to have full conversations with students at my teaching pracs and I'm feeling a lot more confident :D

Life IS great, thanks for the reminder :)
Yes it is :) Thank you for posting!
If you need ANYTHING I'm here to serve you!
I need a link to r/pessimism please! I hear that place really rocks.
I can tell this place is gonna turn right around thanks to you!
I just know you're going to be a wonderful moderator!
http://www.reddit.com/r/pessimism lol
sarcasm or optimism? haha
You will come back from the grave. Be optimistic.

Good luck.

BTW, I can help in moderation if this takes off.
Even if r/optimism is small and slow - [r/pessimism is smaller](http://www.reddit.com/r/pessimism)! So by that standard, r/optimism is a raging success - now let's make it EVEN BETTER, because we're all REALLY AWESOME!
YAY for optimism! 

*willing to help as Mod too. =D

And it still sucks for some people. ;)
My username describes me best, so happy to have found a subreddit dedicated to optimism :) Thx.  
care to share some of that? :) 
My emotions go up and down all the time, yet I'm trying my hardest to be optimistic as much as possible.
It certainly is tough! I heard this great saying, "circumstances don't matter, only state of being matters" 

I just believed that and am thinking different with a positive sense :) 
Everyone has ups and downs, regardless of whether or not they're "optimistic". Everyone struggles, its just important to keep fighting the good fight and keep in mind that you're an irreplaceable human soul. That's regardless of religious beliefs, too. You're a fantastic consciousness. The only thing in the universe that *knows* that it *is*. That's such a beautiful concept:) keep on lovin', keep on fightin'.
[deleted]
Some days I'm extremely low, other days I feel low and then positive then low again, and other days I just don't give a crap and focus on positive, and I just never know what's gonna come of each day unfortunately. 
It will take take time, I'm sure you can do it :)  
That's part of the beauty of it:) you never know. Think of a photograph. Which is better, the dark parts of the photograph, or the light parts?  
  
The answer is obviously neither. It's both the light and the dark that make the picture what it is. Such is life. Times aren't always great! Don't I know it, I've had the flu for the past few days. And yeah, it sucks. Sitting on my couch unable to move isn't fun. Nobody is happy then. But I can always think: "this is existence, this is part of life". I encourage you to do the same! It's all about perspective. You got this. It's not immediate, its a journey. But it's a wonderful thing! I'd recommend reading about Buddhism, that's what really helped my transition.     
  
I used to be really depressed. Not suicidal, but close. I never thought i'd be where I am. You can do this. You can do this.
  
Everything will be OK.

There really is a subreddit for **everything** . Tonight I was doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen and was annoyed with something a roommate does, as every roommate seems to have that one things. The more I considered it, I realized that it proved to be a beneficial thing. Then I thought, there should be a subreddit where people describe and/or shed light on simple optimisms they find in things. This might help others to count there blessings, if you will, and I decided it would be called r/optimism. Turns out you guys are real. That's Number One
Its not very active but nice stuff pops up here every now and then.  I feel ya on the roommate thing. Living and working with my best friend of 20 yrs I came up with something to remember when it comes to living with somebody you really care about.

He who keeps score always loses. 
My roommate is my dog and although he can be brat and cause trouble, it is so worth it to have his companionship.  When I get home from work he leaps of the bed and runs towards me and then twirls in circles.  He always makes me smile no matter how bad my day has been.
I was actually thinking about how most sub reddits I see are negative so I wanted to make one where people post random acts of kindness that they see other people doing. Such as, I was walking to the bus stop today and waiting for the light to change when I see the bus coming. I waved my arms at the driver and he stopped and waited for me. Then on the bus there was a man who had limited use of his legs with a wheelchair in front of him when another lady in a wheelchair was boarding the bus this guy gets on his knees ( he had knee pads on) and he lifted the seats to make room for her then when the lady got off he took off the support hooks and put the seats back down.  People are good you just have to notice and appreciate it. I want to see more of that on reddit and I found this sub. Bravo. 
Amen to that one right? I'm the same way with my roommates. I have known them forever, one since preschool. My preschool friend works at Lowe's, as do I and my other roommate just got in interview at Lowe's as well. It makes for interesting times but damn good ones at the same time.
I couldn't agree more. Thank you for sharing! haha that's what r/optimism needs more of I feel. Just simple stories like that where people recognize the great things they have in their lives. I have two dogs of mine own so I know exactly what you mean! Can't live with em', can't live without em'! :)


Thanks for everything, TheSimpleArtist!
Good luck, I'm sure you'll be an *amazing* moderator!
Thanks mrjack, glad to be here!
The title basically says it all. I have extremely negative feeling toward basically all strangers and most of the people that I know. I'm not a loner, like I do have some people that I know and love or that I consider to be descent, but there are probably fewer than 100 of them. If anyone has suggestions for other subreddits to post this in that would be great. I don't really plan on becoming an optimist, but I think optimists are probably the people I should talk to considering that they're the opposite extreme of me. I feel like my hatred of people, both individuals and mankind, is a contributing factor in how difficult it is for me to form new relationships with others. I also think that it has taken a heavy toll on my mental health
Hey OP, I'm a bit of a misanthrope myself so I can relate. Kudos to you for calling yourself out on it. From personal experience, something that helped me out a lot was a quote that said, "behind every cynic there is a disappointed idealist." Maybe you've been let down or hurt by someone you cared about? Hopefully you come closer to reaching your goals, I wish you the best of luck!
Sorry for leeching off of your post but I am the same way and I want to change. I only have 3 people in my life that I care about
Have you always been this way? 
If something good could happen, it would be awesome :)
Hello,  Reddit!  My life has been  tennis match between pessimism and optimism.  For a little while it seemed like it was optimism's game... but over the past 5 years,  pessimism has been dominating. 

Let me start by saying,  in my line of work... optimism is key.  I am a special education teacher.  For the past 21 years,  I've always put the positive spin on every situation that occurred with my students to make them realize life doesn't  suck.  I am also married and the father of two young children.  I always have to be an the optimist.  This being said... It's not my nature.  My parents were worriers.  They worried about everything.  This became my nature.  When I was 14,  I remember having a panic attack because one of my friends told me the planets were aligning and Earth was going to have massive earthquakes and tsunamis.  Needless to say it didn't happen,  the only thing shaken up was me.  As I got older I learned to put on a "tough guy"  exterior.  Tried not to show my friends and family what was going on inside. Going back... at 8 years old,  I found my grandpa dead on the kitchen floor. I went in to call him for dinner... He had a massive heart attack.  There's nothing you can do to unscar an 8 year old from that.  The idea of death (more so the fear of losing my loved ones )  loomed in the background of my thoughts.  While in my early 30s, my 13 year old cousin passed way from muscular dystrophy.  I was there with him after he passed.  He was still sitting up in his bed.  Messed me up.  He was also mentally handicapped.  It was like losing a baby.  During the events of 9-11 and the aftermath... I was falling apart (I live 15 minutes outside NYC.) Didn't know what to think.  I was so happy I was getting married the next year... but would I make it to my wedding? Was this the beginning of WW3? Threw myself into a life of optimism.  Felt great.  Started looking at the glass half full.  I knew it felt right.  Problems in the first year of marriage threw me into a depression.  We almost split up,  but realized we loved each other too much to let it go.  In 2007, I had my daughter...it was an amazing experience.  In 2013 after years of not being able to conceive a second child and a bunch of fertility drugs... we had our second child,  a boy.  During that pregnancy,  the doctor told my wife the placenta was attached to her uterus... There was a risk she could die.  She was prepping me for life without her.   
I'm 45...my family is healthy,  my parents are living... I have all to be thankful for. My wife is difficult,  my kids are difficult,  and we struggle financially,  but we're together and we love each other.  The problem is,  I can't get back the brief year of optimism I had before I got married.  I fake it well for a those around me, but inside... I fear the future and for the safety of those I love.  I know it's irrational.  I know I can get back my sense of optimism. Just need help.  Any ideas or links to stuff that will push me in the right direction.  Thanks!!!! 
Funny, i have a somewhat similar experience in some ways. i come from a dysfunctional family life and i'm a serious worrier. Never have i had enough money. I have a beautiful wife and two beautiful kids but we struggle with money. i have a very hard time being optimistic but sometimes i'm  successful with it. i'm not religious and could never be so, more existentialist (we create meaning where there really is none). The only thing i can say is, look for the smallest success in your day that will help you be more optimistic. Sometimes the overall life challenges aren't going to let you be optimistic as much. If you bring it down to smaller chunks it may help, it does for me. Hope this helps a little. 
Thanks! That's good advice.  I've tried it before,  but forget It's how I used to have "personal"  good days.  I have used the little successes as a boost.  I look at those who are simple in nature... those that don't over-think life and are just happy with the little things and yearn to be like that.  I'm trapped in the mind of a "thinker".  The hardest part is not projecting this on your family.  Only my close family knows how I really think.  Especially at work,  I'm the "happy guy".  I always want others to look at the silver lining when inside I'm like "this sucks!!!! “.  I'm always waiting for the hammer to fall instead of enjoying the moment.  I'm not religious at all.  I'm somewhat existential myself.  I believe that everything we believe is wrong and that life, death,  and time are only what our brains can understand.  I find comfort in that fact.  I've also come to realization that it doesn't matter what you believe and your own death is nothing to fear because a)  There is nothing... so follow whatever religion you want because you will cease to exist upon your death and never know it wasn't what you thought it was b) you never die... the energy that is your life gets reused (some form of reincarnation or loop in existence where you continue on with no knowledge of previous existence... Which also won't matter,  because you will have no recollection (which connects to the brain)  of your previous life,  or we do move on to some other plane of existence and there is some sort of 2nd life.  Any way you slice it, what you believe is just comfort,  because upon your death it's either something or nothing.  Either way... It satisfies the end.  I choose to believe in something  because nothing seems pointless.  It's the worry for my family that destroys me.  I know as much as I protect them.  There are things that are  beyond my control.  That's what gets me.   

Hey,  thanks for the response.  It's really appreciated.  Sometimes being like this,  you feel alone. It's nice to know someone else understands. 
You are not alone, I totally get it. Religion does bring comfort for some, for me, just makes me bitter/angry. I try not to even think about it. Just small things in your day that are good, amplify them as much as you can. I also always try to be happy and positive for my kids, strangers, etc. just  to make them feel good. On the inside I struggle sometimes. I've looked for answers my whole life (i'm 54) where there really is none. What is there is an interesting universe of stars, planets and scientific exploration to discover. I play guitar to myself, golf sometimes, etc. At one time I studied Buddhism, some of those tenets help greatly too. i'm not really a follower though and can not sustain any beliefs for very long, they end up ringing hollow for me. That's o.k., it's all learning and experience. Enjoy some friends, have some wine, enjoy chasing yer wife, play with your kids. Just keep movin on.

Good start, keep going!
Thanks for sharing 😊
Thanks! :)
Absolutely! We need a dose of positivity now and then :)

Rush is my favorite band and Marathon is my favorite song. It helped me through a pretty dark phase of my life. 
I only discovered Rush two days ago. It's like some of their songs' lyrics are reading my mind. How is that even possible?
Oh man, you're in for a treat. They have 40 years of music for you to dive into. Anything in particular that opened the doors for you?
Well for a while I've felt this feeling of growing angst; it's like the whole world and mass-media is falling into a wave of mass-pessimism. All the old *Beyond-2000* dreams of the future have come true already, so we're now living in the future, but it's still not quite right and we're all out of things to dream about. I try to imagine something better in my mind's eye but nothing seems to show up.

I don't know why, but this kind of music feels like the antidote... somehow.
Someone told me recently to think positively and good things will happen. i'm often too negative and have a lot of bad luck and hard times. Has anyone done any studies on this?
I'll  be totally honest with you, being optimistic has worked wonders for me the past few months.



Back in my senior year of highschool, I acted very negative and cynical about things. The problem with thinking like that is that there is no end in sight. You will always be rolling yourself over to the next negative thought, and so on and so forth. It is like a snowball that keeps getting bigger and bigger.




When you think positively, you are constantly reframing your thoughts. You are always looking to seek the next best thing, and sometimes, it doesn't always come out of no where. Sometimes it takes a long time to find a good experience from a long and shitty one. But don't let that discourage you, because if you think positively even about the little things, you'll find yourself getting better and better at dealing with harder situations and finding out more better ones to combat them.
[Science says it does.](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950) I've been in all sorts of psychotherapy for PTSD over the last seven years or so and at first I was totally adamant that it doesn't do a thing to "force yourself" to think positively, but that was when I didn't have control over my ruminations. My current therapist has been really helpful in establishing ways where I can't avoid reminding myself to be positive and slowly I have been able to change my outlook. While I don't know for sure if the good things in my life have increased in amount, I do know that I look at them in a less judgmental light.
To me, it does not change reality. It alters your perspective so that you view the unchanging reality from a different angle. A better one. Positivity can influence other people and situations; with that being said a greater atmosphere is available to live in. So, I change my viewpoint from when I first started typing.  It DOES, change reality. Try it for yourself, tell us your expirience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNo7t9GbQTY
i think you're totally right. Finding something positive and focusing on that more and holding on to it will lead to another positive (eventually) and holding on to that one will continue.
I freaking agree with you, yo! Reality still can be a pain even when I'm optimistic, but the difference is that I know that things can get better, and that there's a true and proper path towards getting better. Optimism doesn't involve being delusional. Optimism involves being realistic, and reality isn't something that only holds negative things, yo. :)
Seems like it's very underused. i came here to be more optimistic and motivated to be positive. No one here???
No clue, but in keeping with the theme I'll say that everyone here achieved enlightenment in the ways of optimism and then left the sub to go out into the world to bring enlightenment and joy to others. 
Cool, how do I get some of that "enlightenment" stuff? Gotta be waaayyy mmmore optimistic???
Hell if I know... I'm still m0rose ;)
What if the sub was a little more active? Betcha it would help....hope things get better for ya!
My girlfriend (27) is quite pessimistic, complaining all the time and never quite satisfied. I am quite content and positive most of the time.

We had a long discussion yesterday, and I brought up that her negativity was an issue for me. She said she's willing to try and change because she actually wants to be a positive person. Her parents were always very negative so this attitude has been deeply engrained in her for years.

What's the best way to approach this? 

Thanks!!

tl;dr: girlfriend is pessimestic but willing to work to change. Is this possible, what are the steps?
Something that I found this really really important has to do with habits. She may want to change but her habits are deeply ingrained in her (as are everyone's) the best thing you can do is help her change her habits and coping mechanisms.
 For example if the first thing she does is look for problems when she meet people for the first time, maybe you can make a game with her where you point out people's positive attributes , or encourage her somehow to make changes.  You are in for a long road ahead of you and I would encourage you to do research into habits. Remember that she spent 27 years of her life to get to Wear she has right now, so she has to unlearn all those habits. Hopefully this helps





"Someone who was once depressed and suicidal is grinning ear to ear, having discovered newfound purpose, solace, and joy." I am grinning from ear to ear reading this, because *that's me.*

These are exactly what I need after my hangover!  It'll get better though!


Right-o.  It most certainly will, there's a good chap.
I have thought on this subject for a long time now. Essentially, I love many of the concepts that a church represents. I think that this type of establishment could help spread ideas, open doors to friendship and enable people to grow much as a church does. However, I do not want to involve religious views in anyway. I would like the sermons to be more like TED talks, philosophy discussions, and things of the sort. I think that you could add yoga, farmers markets, music and many more things to these gatherings! I feel that we have grown to avoid discussions and if we had something to facilitate this, it would help us move forward. How would you title the church to attract yet not sound religious or stupid. Anyway, I respect the reddit community immensely so I came here looking for ideas and opinions
I think that is a beautiful idea.  Not sure what you could call it, but I would think you would want to make sure the name made people feel good about joining in.

Have you ever been to a unitarian universalist service?  It is very much like the type of experience you describe
Church of none, for everyone. The idea is great, reminds me of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z78_rAg4Ldg
No I haven't. I will look into it. Thanks for the heads up!

I just watched the 2015 movie "Tomorrowland" and it is, in the end, really about optimism. 

Striving for a better world is easier if you start off imagining one rather than thinking obsessively about how everything is going to hell in a handbasket.  

As I'm sure anyone who has subscribed to this subreddit knows, that's not about ignoring reality.  It's about vision.  

This is a movie that unashamedly celebrates that.  

I think you'll like it.
sold, will watch tonight. 
watched it, liked it. thanks

I very much like this. I will add this to my morning affirmations. Thanks!
Place a simple stone in your pocket, every time you touch it think to yourself what you are thankful for; at the end of the night and at the end of the day place it back into your life. 
I love it.  Good idea.
Summer was the roman candle that took my favorite color up into the air. She splashed rainbow after rainbow across the sky and let them crackle, flicker, cool and eventually fade into silver metal flecks that floated above my head so far out of reach. Teenagers set off cherry bombs in parking lots and kids ran around backyards with sparklers in both hands, illuminating the evening in irregular streaks. Music was playing but from somewhere far enough away that it sounded like a dull heartbeat — only if you plugged your ears, you could still feel it because it was in you. Burnt orange and baby blue hung suspended in a mist for what seemed like hours even though there was a breeze blowing down the length of the coast. In the valley far below, a glowing galaxy of streetlights cast blurry shadows around the city, through alleyways, around corners and across the sides of buildings. You could touch the shadows and if you did, your hands came away black and sooty. You could walk through shadows hanging in mid-air like sheets on a clothesline and you could feel the tiny grains touch your open eyes before you blinked and they fell to the ground like dust. I imagined I was somewhere in the sky, running my hand down a moonbeam like you would a staircase banister but rather at an upward angle. I followed it across the sky from one star to another, connecting the dots until it led me through the deepest darkness I’d ever known. Finally the morning light turned over on the horizon like an ember in a fireplace before it glows and eventually catches fire. I made it home and you were there waiting for me and it was then that I realized it was you who stirred the fire and guided me through the blackness. I’ve been called a moonlighter before but this may be the first time it all adds up.

I really wanted to not like that movie but I ended up thinking it was ok. 
Ever since "Bubble Boy" I've liked Jake Gyllenhal.


It's just nature. Optimism is never a pressing matter of life or death. But negative stuff *can* theoretically become life threatening, so that means we naturally focus on negative things to defuse them first. Optimism is just no priority.
:/

A lot of people are getting really upset over trump, and I just want to say that everything gonna be all right. the world will survive, and if it doesn't trump will be the least of your problems. Kick back your feet and watch the fire works. Another lying politician will be in the office another 4-8 years and the cycle will continue. In worrying you only hurt yourself twice.
I usually refrain from commenting on political posts, but this is not optimism! This is being sedentary and refraining from action! 


Now I'm depressed.
How is this optimism? 


I use to be depressed for 15 months. Between the ages 13-14 and now I am not. When I was 10-11 I was so optimistic. I want tips to become more optimistic like when I was 10 :) Please. :3 Ages 13-14 destoryed made me kind of pessimist. I need to come a optimist! I also gave up: 
Caffeine
Pop
Chocolate
Eating after dinner
Workout 20 mins a day.

Give me tips to come back to optimistic! PLEASE. 2 years off because of damn depression and pessimistic. I did had suicide thoughts when I was depress to tell you how depress I was. I want to become optimistic now like I use to be when I was 10-11. Give me tips :) Appreciated.   

I'm counting on you guys. Don't let me down. 

First post on this subreddit. 
Depression kind of killed some of my optimistic I WANT IT ALL BACK. 

Help. lol
middle school does that to ya

Basically i need to feel better about the future of the internet and the free flow of information and opportunity.




Wow, first post in months. Great job!
Amazing, so amazing, thank you thank you for this!


Nice!

So I have a problem. I'll be happily going about my day, looking positively to the future, doing my own thing, etc. 

And then it hits me like a wall of bricks. Once I had read where someone said basically we are all slowly dying from the moment we are born, and my subconscious seems to bring that back up constantly even though I don't agree. I'll be enjoying myself and then the thought will pop up of "why do this and how can you enjoy this if you're going to get older, eventually die, etc." 

Worse is even though I'm agnostic my overthinking brain makes me think "if there is an afterlife what if it's so different that normal human experience is actually wierd, and if it's eternal then this life is short and not worth anything" like wtf? I don't even try to think of crap like that, so apparently I need some help beating some more optimistic thoughts in my subconscious. Throw me some better perspectives reddit!

Tl;Dr: Subconscious makes me think nihilistically out of nowhere when I'm enjoying myself, need some suggestions on a better perspective to fall back on.
I read a book that really helps me it's The Book of Joy by Desmond Tutu, Douglas Carlton Abrams, and Lhamo Dondrub. Basically it talks about how helping others makes you happy and changes your perspective. From two spiritual leaders' perspective it has instructions on mind exercises you can do at the end of the book to exercise the right mindsets. I'm not religious at all I'm also agnostic but this book definitely one I go back to time and time again.

Also Up : How Positive Outlook Can Transform Our Health And Aging by Hilary Tindle
A book based on a real study gives scientific proof of why optimism physically helps us live longer and benefits our health as well as methods to increase positive thinking and healthy habits.

Hope these help.

I hate the title of this, which is unfortunate because it's a great read.  
There's one in my town (I just moved here yesterday) and I am interested in learning more about the experiences of those who have participated in one!
My Dad was in one for years, he loved it.  

They did alot of fundraisers, pancake breakfasts, etc.  Lots of charity type stuff.

It takes at least three votes to surrender :3


Maybe it's been said so often people are tired of it, but I think a lot of people fail to see how powerful this idea is: *When life gives you lemons, make lemonade*.  It seems that people tend to see this as advice for how to think in a truly terrible situation. Life gives us these little lemons every day.  With a bit of effort and imagination, we can be making lemonade all the time.  When a pencil breaks or whenever anything goes wrong, that gives you opportunities.  A broken pencil isn't much, but neither is a broken atom.  These things add up.  
Totally agree with you but sometimes hard to remember. I should write myself a note!

yea, I think the news makes life look really bad all the time. Not enough positive reporting going on. Doesn't make news I guess.

:D Just another reason why PessimismSucks!


So I just watched Cinderella... and suddenly I have this air of hope that no matter how things get or could be, they CAN and WILL always get better!

SO what I am asking is, what has happened to you, that you would explain as luck and how did it change your life for the better?
try askreddit? itd be an interesting thread to read.

My cake day post :-) 
Heard this song on Saturday Night Live last night & it's my new favorite.  Love the lyric - chaos around, world falling down...  Well, time to figure out how I'm going to look at this in an optimistic way.  Such happy, peppy music at that point in the song!  
I have loved this song because of the line you posted about so thank you :) I'm not alone.





Hanson??

technically your cup runneth over.




Amazing blog about true love, how did this workout??

http://www.myhusbandisasociopath.wordpress.com
This is a blog about a codependent and her narcissistic ( or borderline narcissist as she says) partner.  I'm not sure I'd call this a positive or even healthy relationship as a codependents source of happiness is doing whatever it takes to please their partner while the narcissist focuses on taking.  She says she's changed, but if you Google Sam the narcissist videos you'll see why this is quite hard to believe.  He could just be extremely selfish meaning he had the ability to change, but refuses...making her then seem delusional for believing the behavior is the result of a mental health issue.



if you're feeling good about things, well, just forget it
Words to live by

Thanks for sharing! Really made me think and look at things differently.
How can one be a comedian and still be optimistic about life? Many of a comedian's material is from emphasizing flaws in humanity. Standup material does not always seek to correct human flaws, only highlights them. How can one make material like this with only the feel good laugh lasting for as long as you are willing to make fun of it?
I'm not a comedian but I try to keep one idea alive in my head. My words do not define reality. My thoughts do not define reality. Likewise, other peoples words do not define reality either.  

So I am allowed to think terrible things, or to muse over negative ideas. I can later amend my thoughts: "No I don't feel that way after all." I don't seek out negative thoughts, but I am willing to forgive myself for occasional transgressions.  I haven't set the world in stone by thinking. 

When I speak things out loud, I often come to understand myself a little better by paying the consequences or just working through it. Sometimes a bit of cynicism is healthy. Other times it seems injurious to my spirit, and I look for a better way to view the world.  

But it is wrong to bury a bad thought, throw on a smile and pretend everything is great. It has to be chewed on, analysed, and if so, I might as well spit it out. Perhaps someone else will set me straight.  

So if I were a comedian, I'd make jokes about my fears, my angers, my sadnesses. And then I'd have to deal with them. And then I'd be done with them.
I have this exact issue.  Here's what I do,... not saying it's right, and I definitely still have problems with pessimism:

Learn to observe without judging whether the thing you see is good or bad, right or wrong.  Learn to hold a thought in your mind without committing to it or believing it.  If you are writing jokes about a subject full of personal pain points, write as many jokes **from as many different perspectives possible** about the pain points. Jokes are a way of capturing and taming our fears or pains, jokes make them manageable by giving us a way to laugh about them.  If it still hurts you, you haven't written the right joke yet.

fyi, I use joke writing as a form of therapy.  It doesn't always work but it works enough to keep it in my toolbox.

re: perspectives,... I often take a setup or a premise and imagine it through the eyes of an alien, or an 8th grade fat kid who farts a lot, some famous folks from history, certain relatives and people I grew up with, and current celebutantes.  I do this because they will each **view the thing** being joked about **differently** and because of their background, they will **respond to the thing differently.**  This helps me find more jokes or funnier ways to deliver them.  But I've also found that the more perspectives I have about a thing, even if the thing is clearly a problem or a point of pain, the cooler I can be while handling the thing.

tldr: zen mind tricks + more perspectives.
So, I just flew in from Dallas (and boy are my arms tired). 

Anyway, I don't why you have to do cynical comedy. 

1. Comedy, even stand-up, is not required to be cynical, it's just about juxtaposing expectations. 

(So I was pulled over by a traffic cop and he asked, "Do you know why I pulled you over?" I said, "Sure, so it wouldn't so windy when we talked!")

(I'm an optimist. I like to think of everything as half full. Like life!  . . .  .  . . . And landfill space!)

(I have an excellent watch dog. Keeps a watch on everything. A few months ago he watched our house get broken into. Than last month he watched the garage burn down! Than he watched some kids egg our front door! Never misses a beat that old dog!)

2. If you think stand-up comedy goes against your nature, why are you trying to do it?

(Only on an optimist subreddit could there be a background like this. "Hey, you can still read comments if you highlight absolutely everything! Glass is half full!)




You could make fun of cynicism.  :)

The other thing you see a lot of comedians do is create a character.  Andy Kaufman's "Foreign Man," for example, was basically an optimist. I think people would like to see someone on a stage who seemed a little too optimistic - and then always seemed to come out on top.  ("So I told the police officer, 'Yes, I was speeding!  I wanted to get to the beach!  It's a beautiful day!  Why spend it at a job you hate?'  The cop said 'Hold on,' then came back with his swimming trunks....")











You cannot change the truth but the truth can change you.
Is this true in your life?


Adam says that he always has tried to give his songs a more optimistic outlook on life even when the world seems to be the opposite of that.



Loved it.
First part is little hard to understand .
Thanks for watching.
Because it's nonsense. Optimism changes perception in a useful and positive way, but it does not physically change the world around us. The claims in this video are the result of a little knowledge being misapplied. But it's a nice thought (even if inaccurate).
Thanks for watching.

But the scientific results in video proved that our conscious intention create matter.







😢👍☺

This is great! I feel so much better about my laptop now!!! 
Thanks endurendal for the appreciation....
