So I'm in a relatively new marriage of 1.5 years. Circumstances allowed me to only meet my two (8yo boy and 11yo girl) once prior to marriage. 

So myself being a guy, the 8yo was no problem. I know how to entertain a kid who just digs sports, video games and poop jokes. An 11yo girl going through puberty though? Nah no clue. 

Our girl is extremely shy/quiet. Probably because she is going through a pivotal point in her life with a complete stranger (myself). Today I asked her to cook dinner with me for my birthday gift. What followed was a miracle.

She immediately responded to my request to help. Seemed interested in what I was showing her. And showed a sense of concern when I inevitably burnt myself. 

I'm far from an outstanding stepfather or truth be told, a person in general. But I am loving this moment where I was able share something. 

She probably doesn't care all that much. But it made my year. 
That's very awesome to hear :-) thank you for sharing and I hope it continues to go well!
That's awesome! Maybe cooking can be your "thing" together.  Find out what kinds of food she likes, and let her help plan the menus. It sounds like such a good bonding experience, and since you're doing something that requires concentration, it's probably easier for a shy young girl to participate without feeling awkward. 
That's great. It seems like you do care about your step kids and want to make them comfortable and a part of your life. They may not fully appreciate that right now, but give it time. I hope things continue going well and that your burn is only minor.
Hey Reddit! I haven't posted very much prior to this, but I found something today that would bring me a great deal of joy to share with you all.

My mom passed away on Valentine's Day, 2009. She had recovered from breast cancer in 2001, but it returned and metastasized to her brain and liver in summer 2008. Last last year I stumbled upon a journal she used to journal prayers and thoughts during the last year of her life. My older sister had the idea of getting tattoos of our mom's nicknames for us in her handwriting, so I used this journal to find our nicknames. I've since kept the journal and flip through it on days when I miss her. Today, while cleaning my apartment, I picked it up out of my desk drawer and opened to a random page, where I found a quote from my mom while she was in hospice.

"To love someone is to learn the song that is in their heart and to sing it to them when they have forgotten."

It is dated for January 18th, 2009, which happened to be my 15th birthday. After shedding more than a few tears at this blessing, I thought about the significance of this for my mother. She also battled alcoholism and depression for most of my childhood but persisted and remained sober the last year of her life. She was always surrounded by our family and friends who were hurt by her drinking over the years, but they knew that her heart was not defined by her drinking. It was spoken over her time and time again, until she remembered the song that was in her heart. 

She was a speech pathologist who helped children with autism and other disorders speak for the first time. Many of these children were Hispanic immigrants and came from a family that couldn't afford much. She showed them compassion and empathy and helped many families get on their feet. She was an incredible woman, who struggled like many others. 

To end, I feel like on my birthday in 2009, my mom realized how much significance her life had, and she remembered that the song of her heart, not her afflictions, defined her. And I think that's the best birthday present I've ever received, even if it was almost 8 years late.

Thanks for reading everybody!

Very nice!

I have been leaving notes for my children so that if I die, they find them. One thing is though, I have posted negative things online. I am thinking I need to go through and delete them all so they cannot find those when/if they figure out my user names.
That is absolutely beautiful. Thank you for sharing it :)
Made me tear up. Thanks for sharing 
What a wonderful gift, from a wonderful human being!!  Have you thought about having that tatooed somewhere on your body?  I don't believe in coincidences and coming across that note at the same time you and your sister are considering getting personal tatoos makes me think the universe wants you to ink that on yourself.  Just a thought!

If you don't mind, too?  I'd like to copy that, just for my own use.  I tend to jot down sayings and things that strike a chord with me, and that one.....well, it caused an orchestra to sound in my mind, when I read it!  Is it okay if I jot it down?  Don't be afraid to tell me now, I'm a big girl and can take it.  LOL 

I'm sorry you lost your Mom, honey.  She truly sounds like one of those remarkable people about whom books are written, y'know?  I wish I could have known her!
That is a great idea!! I think notes like that are a great reminder of who a person is. When I read her journal I can also hear her voice, so it feels like a conversation. Your children will be very lucky to have those, but in the meantime I wish you a long life to share with them!! 

And hopefully they won't have much interest in your online activity...but smart idea haha
Thanks for your reply! We actually got our nicknames tattooed on us last year-I paid for my sister's for her birthday and got mine with her. But after finding this, I'm considering getting it as well!! It would be my fourth tattoo, and my third in remembrance of her. 

You can absolutely use that quote. I'm not even sure it was an Annette original!! Regardless, words that touch people should be spoken and shared. 

She would love your kind words!! 
Thank you so much!!  Now I wish I had a nickname so I could get another tat!??  lol
I'm not posting this to ask for advice, I'm not troubled by any of this. I'm posting because I feel that what I'm about to say is a taboo that few people want to break, and because I'm honestly interested in seeing how people react. 

With a title like "I don't love my parents", your first question is likely "How bad were they?" The answer: Almost certainly not as bad as you imagine. I don't know if any of the physical pain inflicted meets the legal definition of abuse, but it probably does not. Hitting wasn't daily or even weekly. I was never neglected in terms of food, clothing, education, or basic childhood needs. Neither of my parents were alcoholics, junkies, gambling addicts, or criminals. I lived in a middle class home, I even lived there after turning 18 and was financially supported for a little while before getting married and moving out. So you wouldn't call my parents terrible people, and I wouldn't either.

To me, my parents had the best intentions but were absolutely in over their head and just weren't good at parenting. Rather than a huge narrative, I'll offer a few examples:

- When I was 7 years old, I was upset that my mom wouldn't let me do something and complained "You're being just like [very strict parent of my friend]." She threw a very hard object at my eye and then immediately broke down in tears and apologized. I wasn't injured but it was very traumatic. 

- After a run-of-the-mill argument between my mother and I, she threatened that she would divorce my father and leave. My father wasn't involved in the argument and had nothing to do with it. I was 10 years old. I was shocked that she would leave my father over something I did, something very insignificant - not even an action like drawing on the wall or stealing something, just arguing. 

- At age 11, after a very loud, intense argument and being hit, I locked myself in my room and they demanded that I come out. Not five minutes later they kicked down the door. This happened two more times in the same year. 

- When I was 12, I was a straight A student in school who never got in trouble, but my teacher was bothered by the fact that my locker and papers were disorganized. My father was told this after school. He opened my locker in front of all the other students, threw all my things on the floor, and yelled at me to pick it up and organize it. 

- When I was 13, I was depressed and self-harming. My mother said "If you're trying to kill yourself, you're doing it wrong, dumbass." 

- When I was 14, I came out as an atheist. Both my parents told me that I was a piece of shit, and screamed at me for 2 solid hours while I continually spoke in a calm voice and tried to deescalate. 

- When I was 15, I was going to skate to my friend's house on a summer day like I do every day. It was an extremely windy day with 40mph winds blowing nonstop. As I was in the driveway about to leave, my father came out and said "you always look like a bum, brush your hair before you go!" I pointed out that the wind would completely mess up my hair no matter what. He said if I left without brushing my hair he would break my computer. 


So, you listen to these events and might want to say to me that I have no idea what having a bad childhood really is, that you dealt with drunk parents beating you with a belt, being evicted, not being fed for days and that I should be grateful. And I say this to you: I don't think any of those things make them terrible people, and I don't hate them for it. I've forgiven all of that and I also recognize that everyone including myself acts irrationally and hurts other people sometimes. 

But those events made me lose respect for them. They broke a door after five minutes when I would have come out in an hour anyway cause of hunger, boredom, or having to pee. Wasn't "my" door, I wasn't the one paying to replace it. Or the hairbrushing thing, it sounds so petty to bring up an incident like that. But my father was either bullying me or was really stupid, and either way all of these events collectively put me beyond respecting them. 

My relationship with my parents has improved significantly since reaching adulthood and moving out. I talk to them, I visit them, I even enjoy time with them sometimes. But I'm not close with them. There are easily 20 people in my life who I would rather talk to about a personal problem, a deep insecurity, a great fear than them. And even if those 20 people couldn't help I would rather talk to internet strangers. They're very bad at empathy and worse at advice. I don't have any sense of trust. And I really don't love them. I don't hate them either. To me they're like acquaintances, I am polite and they're decent to me more of the time than not but I don't have a familial bond. The most important person in my life is my spouse, and then my best friend.


I know some people have an unbreakable bond with their family no matter what. Hell, there are kids who have been prostituted by their parents for drugs or had parents break their bones who still love them. I don't get it. I can tell you with certainty that if there was severe abuse like those examples, they wouldn't be in my life at all, I would not have contact with them, I would not be at their funeral.

I'm not sure my lack of a bond with them is entirely or even mostly their fault. I think it's something with my brain, how I form bonds and how I give love and respect. In conclusion in regards to my parents: They tried their best at raising a kid, they were really bad at it, I was kind of a difficult kid as well and accept some blame, I don't hate them, I don't resent them, and I wish them the best and that they have happy lives. Now that I'm living very, very far away it's easy for me to be at peace with them. It's just that family as this sacred concept never clicked for me. 
I read the first part of your post and was ready to say something like "maybe you should cut your parents some slack, I'm sure they did the best they could"...but after reading some of the examples of their behavior I'm actually a little disturbed. They WERE abusive. Maybe not the most abusive parents that ever existed but plenty abusive enough. I do not blame you one bit for not being close to people that treated you like that during your vulnerable, formative years. 
I've gone through life being told by my mother "I brought you on exotic holidays, I have paid for so much for you, I drove you everywhere etc." - it is a parent's job to provide for you in whatever way they can while you grow and mature, sometimes though they fail to provide the essential emotional care that helps you develop. There is no excuse for irrational behaviour, constant jabs and torments. I think people (including myself) need to get away from this obsession with family as 'sacred' as you say. Nobody would put up with that type of behaviour from a friend, so why accept it from your own parents?
This, to me, does constitute abuse. I have a 7 year old cousin and I couldn't imagine ever throwing anything at him in anger. You didn't deserve to be treated like that. I'm glad you're at peace now.  
It was my brothers birthday yesterday, and I shared a story about him at his dinner of my favorite memory. Growing up we were very different and didn't always get along, or even like each other. When I was a freshman in high school I used to get bullied everyday walking to the bus stop by a group of other guys. My family never knew, nor my older brother who was a senior, and we barely talked at this time. One particular day they were walking behind me calling me names, as usual. Then one of them ripped my backpack off of me and they wouldn't give it back and when I tried to get it they started pushing me. My brother had come to school late and so had the car and went to the bus stop to pick me up. He saw all of this and got out of the car. Now I was a stick back then, but he was effing huge, I'm talking 6'4 and 215 lbs or so. He walked up from behind so no one noticed at first, picked up the kid who was filming all this and tossed him aside like a frisbee he then grabbed the kid who was kicking me and started bitchslapping him in the face until this kid was sobbing. No one was brave enough to stop him. He shouted something like "any of you try this again, I'll find out where you sleep" or something horrifying like that. We didn't even talk much the car ride home but after that we came to some sort of understanding. Siblings don't have to like each other, but if anyone fucks with them they go to war for them.
My sister and I didn't get along until we were adults. She is 2 years older than me and she was pissed over something. My shoe was close to the tire and she tried to drive off to "prove a point." She caught the heel of my foot under the tire. It was all bruised. She begged me not to tell my parents and didn't. Now that we are adults we joke about it all the time and my mom knows it happened.
My wife is pregnant, Reddit. We planned to not have a kid until next year, but, things happened and here we are.

Unexpected, unplanned, but not unwelcome.

😊😊😊
Congratulations!
Congratulations!!
Congratulations! Maybe come over to /r/babybumps and /r/predaddit!
Thank you! It'll be a ride! Our best friends also just told us they're pregnant, and the wives did the math and found out they both conceived at the same time.
I am an 18 year old looking for a home, representing myself as a fostered teenager. Any older stable couples or families, preferably in my area or at least in the Midwest at last resort, who would physically take me in as their kid? If you are single, okay, but please be sure I'd have some more family other than you or a good amount of time with you. Looking for my parent(s) to be a somewhat realistic age to have a teen, maybe around 30 or older. I am just looking for support, a family really, who can care for me as I slowly find my way up as well as make me feel comforted and welcome and give me another chance at youth before I face the outside world. Maybe I could also provide a broken family with a child figure, or open myself to people escaping abuse like me who need more family to live around or people who cannot get enough of helping/fostering and want a challenge. I need a second chance at some love and order. I am not materialistic, I just need a lot of love. I have had a lot of problems, mentally and domestically involving substances and self harm/disorders and neglect/abuse/drama, have been down suicide lane many times, though am much better than I've been but I need guidance majorly here. I am not ready to be in the real world just yet, please try to understand or just don't even continue with me. I seriously have no motivation and am afraid of the world because of past abuse and neglect, I have mild substance and self harm issues. I have problems that currently are causing trouble with employment, my past school record and disorders that need to be settled, and I am in no condition right now physically or emotionally to maintain an independent life even if I do get a chance. I currently attend public classes at my library and it is my "going to school" for the day, my attendance isn't perfect since my problems can still arise but my self discipline hopefully keeps balance. I am very willing to do chores, possible sibling/etc babysitting, or family business, and can (try to!) conform to routine and rules that come with being a teen.

I am opening myself up to an actual live-in home with a determined parent/parents (and maybe even some cool siblings at home or grandparents/extended). A family life with a rules and privilege system to help me with routines and priorities and keep me involved in "school" and productive activities - and maybe make me open up to actual higher education within time. Really, an actual family and a well-reasoned home that can either treat me like biological child or foster child where we have the fun and memories and drama and good and bad everyday life. I am 18 but would like to be your teenager, maybe 14 or 15, with just a little more time and non-neglect and non-abuse to make things right before I put myself out there and possibly cause a lot of problems and lack ability. I want parents to make proud and care for me unconditionally, even when I happen to cause trouble. I need a stable-ish routine. I would provide most of my own clothes, which isn't really much, and I do have my blanket and pillow and interests/junk (enough to fill a few grocery bags). I would really only need school/activity supplies and daily health products, maybe a few new clothes. I may have a laptop with me by the time anything were to actually happen, not seeing a phone or anything happen soon.

I like superheroes and some fantasy or action, might be interested in crafts or cooking if I was motivated, not too sporty but I do sometimes really need to be active or I get cranky, haha. I can be a hermit and depressed but with my good days I really, really desire spending time with a family or going out places or just sitting down and joking around, and with motivation I can open up well. I want to get to you whoever responds very, very well before even trying to meet in person. Please keep it in IA/IL at best, or reasonable distance if you could truly help me. Please reply only if you want to try me out or are considering it, no insults or bull (seriously people, that is immature and hurts me more than it amuses you).
I feel obligated to write this because it is so important and I want everyone who reads this to really soak everything in. I needed tell somebody this because it's been on my mind for so long.

I am 16 years old and I recently lost my father to cancer a little over two months ago. It was hard.. It's still hard. I watched him take his last breath and his eyes close. Words cannot describe how I feel and what I'd do to see his face or talk to the man one last time. However, I am very thankful for having a therapist at my side during his last days. The day before my father passed was one of the most emotional days of my life and I don't think I'll ever forget it. It was the time where I knew it would just be me and him and no other soul between us during this talk. I told him how much I loved him, how I held him responsible for raising such a good son, that I was headed in the right path, and that I was going to be great. I knew he was listening because he tried to get up (he often stood up as a sign he was still strong and fighting) I remember he couldn't and he fell asleep after that because of how much energy it took out of him. But it was that moment I communicated to him, and he responded. It was our last interaction I'd ever have with my father and I am extremely thankful for it. I want to tell you that once your parents are gone, they are gone. You will never see them again in your lifetime. Please, I encourage you to tell your mom you love her. Tell your father you love him. Send them a text or get them something to show your appreciation because one day you won't be able to. Family is one of the most important things in life and if you have family that loves you then you are blessed.
You sound incredibly wise and compassionate. I'm sure that last interaction meant the world to your father and brought him great peace. I'm so sorry for your loss. I dread the loss of my father. I can feel the love that you and your father shared, nothing can take that away.
I am so sorry for your loss
I am so sorry for your loss. You clearly loves your dad very much. He may be gone, but that love will always be a part of you. When things get tough, hold on to that love. Grief from a major loss can last over a year. It will always hurt, but one day it will go from being what you feel the most to being a part of who yoi are. Be kind to yourself. I wish you all the best.
This is so true and it's a beautifully written sentiment. Take care.
thank you for taking the time to write this. It was extremely moving.
All my life I had temper issues and about the age of 14 I had low mood, overweight, low libido, irritable for no reason, rage, sluggish, fatigue and everything. So naturally they take to a therapist ( anger management )  and a psychiatrist for medication, which I never took. At the age of 16 I stopped going to the therapist. I actually opened up very easily and was enthusiased to answer all his questions. His thing was that anger is a secondary emotion and that theres a deeper issue. I spent 2 years with him and we got nowhere, I spilled my guts constantly everyday. When I stopped my parents swore I was going to get arrested due to my anger and not taking my meds. Well funny enough I decided to fix my diet. Before I'd be eating popcorn, drinking sodas, sweets, and chips right before bed everynight. I felt extremely down and crappy the next day. I then began eating 3 meals a day and only water. Turns out not only did my blood pressure and blood sugar go down, I lost weight, I'm way more energetic, no brain fog, my libido slowly increased, I feel alot stronger my mood is perfect and I'm more enthusiased about life and alot more confident. I still get angry but the intensity of it has dropped significantly, now I'm able to be mature in arguments and piss people off from my calmness and smart comments. I'm 18 now and at a healthy weight, this has been consistent for 2 years, this helped me more than therapy ever did. I'm in a constant positive mindset. My parents keep hassling me to go to therapy and try the medication. What aren't they getting? They seem to not really believe that I fixed myself without therapy or meds, but just a big switch in diet. They keep assuming theres something deeper. 
I understand both sides of this. You may feel like you are doing better and that is great, but diet isn't going to fix your anger issues. There is more to therapy than just talking about your problems. A good therapist will teach you techniques for coping and you have to work on using them yourself. Not taking the medication was a bad idea and if you still are having anger issues it probably is good to be evaluated again and if a doctor recommends medication I would consider it. With therapy you only get what you put in. You can't just talk and do nothing else. There is more to it than that.
Thanks. So in your opinion how come my temper has gone down? Things that used to make me rage don't now. I still get angry, but I have no urge to raise my voice or breakthings any longer, my anger just doesn't feel that strong, like a more calm anger. I can now have a civilized argument, it's been this way for 2 years. I also was motivated getting my drivers license and helping out around the house which used to irritate me. I had a discussion about this earlier today  with my father and yeah it was a frustrating conversation, but I was able to speak in a calm manner, in fact he was the one raising his voice and getting angry. I'd also like to point out, I'm functioning better academically in school since my brain fog is no longer effecting me.  Again thanks for the reply and I'm not arguing with you or anything.
Honestly, when you eat better and are healthy you feel better over all. That and hormones. Adolescence is a really difficult time. It is hard to see how much of a role hormones play when you are in the middle of such a change, but they can really cause mood swings. If you are in a better place that is great. You may not need medication. If your family is saying you are not cured it may be because they still witness angry outbursts you dismiss. Or maybe they are just stuck on the idea. It can go either way and without knowing all of you it is hard to say. That said, seeing a therapist is never a bad idea. You don't have to discuss what goes on there and you don't have to discuss your treatment, be it meds or no meds. Just something to consider.
MY mom's in palliative care,l living her life out. 
I just want to say thanks mom,for all the pain and sacrifice and love you gave me.  You never once complained because we had to drive ten hours and an hour and a half ferry ride to go to the Shriners hospital so I CD get a new prosthetics.there one day back the next,never told me how hard it was for the Sunday night collect calls when I had to stay,and I cried because I missed you,you showed me that my leg was no excuse,you pushed me to do it no matter what,or when I screwed up you never gave up on me. Even when I went to jail,you were there for me. And now,that I'm ,63days clean,got a job,an apartment of my own,and doing good,you are proud even as you lay in bed dying,you never gave up on me. You were hard on me,only because you knew if you weren't,life would swallow me whole. You only wanted the best for me,and even when my brother,your son,died,you showed me how something positive came from it. Through my addiction and incarceration and all my troubles,you never gave up on me. So as I sit here,hour after hour,knowing you won't be coming out of the hospital,I just want to say that you are the best mother you could be to me,and the best friend I could ever hope to have,and I will continue to stay clean,and go to work,and make my life not just a potentially good thing,but an actuality,one that you can continue to be proud of,wherever the next step may be for you. I love you momma,and thank you
That is beautiful. Make sure you share that with you. I am.so sorry you are going through this. I can tell you, as a mom, that the best thing in the world is knowing your children love and appreciate you. If you ever need to talk, I am here any time. Congratulations on staying clean. 
Hi there my mum passed away when I was 12 from breast cancer and it's hard I also had to watch my mum die for 6 of them years it's a bad thing to lose your mum..please keep strong and here for a chat any time okay x

Congratulations! Wishing your sister a safe delivery :)
WOOOOOOO!!!
Best gig, ever! Congrats!
Update to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1whvmi/im26_just_found_my_biological_father_i_want_to/).   
So I contacted my biological father through facebook. He responded within ten minutes, telling me how surprised he was that I contacted after 26 years where he couldn't have any news about life (more on that later.). He wasn't at ease with facebook or the phone so we agreed to meet the day after. And we did.   
It couldn't have been better. He was extremely happy to finally meet me. It turns out we do have a lot of common, and I'm his spitting image. He told me a lot about my family history, most notably the circumstances of my birth which were always shady, and that my mother basically ruined his life and did all in her power to prevent him from ever reaching me, going as far as taking his apartement and making him lose his job so he would live on the streets and wouldn't legally be authorized to have any right over me... He basically tried to reach me for 26 years, but because of my mother's crazy sheltering he never could (my mother made all sorts of arrangements so I wouldn't even bear his name before my adoption by my stepdad... crazy stuff).   
I'm still being cautious as I still don't know him fully, but from our first meeting, he is the kind of person I naturally respect and trust, and we have so much common interests that he is the kind of guy I would be friends with before anything (we have the same passions for music, motorcycles, video games, scifi... it's so unexpected ! I mean, he rides the exact motorcycle I was heading for after getting my license ! It's crazy !). And what he told me about my mother is disturbingly coherent with what I have seen and suffered from her and her batshit crazy family. And on top, he was insanely happy and proud of what I became... something my mother could never be and never told me. In the 4 hours+ we talked, he told me more than my mother did in 20+ years.   
We are meeting again next week and I plan to bring him some pictures of me growing up.   
I would like very much to thank /u/Cmboxing100 for his help in the first thread, it really helped me to find what to say in our first meeting and to stay cautious. The second I have enough to buy reddit gold, it's yours !
I am glad you were able to meet him. Please, please be careful. I don't know how your mom is, but when I hear things like she caused him to lose his job and be homeless a red light goes off. It makes me very suspicious because it sounds like someone who doesn't take responsibility for his own actions. I could be very wrong, and I hope I am, just make sure to protect yourself. He may be everything he represents, but he may not be. Get to know him,  but be careful if he asks anything of you. 

I hope this doesn't come off too cynical. I am happy you found him, but I worry that joy can cause you to see him through rose colored glasses.
My mom basically did the exact same thing she did to me : throwing me on the streets, taking my money, trying to brainwash my friends, ruining my reputation with absolutely everyone to the point that I can't show up in my hometown without being judged and hated... I'd be very suspicious too if his story wasn't so similar to mine. I'm naturally cautious, but his story with my mom is so strikingly similar that I tend to trust him. My mother is a terrible narcissist (like I said in my first post, /r/raisedbynarcissists is the story of my life) and everything he said to me correlates big time what I have seen and experienced myself.   
He has been honest on the fact that he's by no means an angel in the story and I'm being extremely cautious too ; but I'm reassured by the fact that our stories are the same, especially since we never knew each other and that could never know what I was doing.   
Thanks for the warning nevertheless, I'm so happy it can get hard to stay down-on-earth.
I am so sorry for what your mom put you through. If she has done it to you it makes sense she could do it to others. I hope you can have a good relationship with your dad :)
Thank you very much. I hope that too =)
I love my family. I love my sister and my brothers and my mom and my dad. Then there's my other family. My "Family." 

My Uncle Karl recently moved in with our family. He had nowhere else to go after his drug-addicted roommate kicked him out, so he hopped on a Greyhound and made the two-day journey from Alabama to my front doorstep. He speaks with a thick country accent. He's out of work due to an illness where his hands shake but is having trouble getting disability. On the day he moved in, we went out to eat and my dad and him told the story of how my Uncle Karl has a federal record because he shot road signs on government owned property. They also told the story of how five guys came to their house to beat up my dad over some girl and my Uncle Karl ran to get their oldest brother who came out with a shotgun. It's like my uncle Karl and I have lived lives in completely different worlds, and now both of our worlds are colliding and they are supposed to fit, but they don't and I don't understand how they're ever reasonably supposed to. 
That's the thing with extended family, your parents plop you next to them and you're told "This is your family," and now you are supposed to be. But you're not. Not really. You're on different levels, you have completely different realities. I like my life a lot, and the life my uncle has is not my own and I want to be selfish and not have them touch. I stay in my world and he stays in his. I wish we could completely avoid the weirdness of trying to make two puzzle pieces from completely different puzzles fit together because I feel out of sorts in my entire life. 
I come home from school and I don't put my stuff down in my room, I hide upstairs, because I know he'll see me from his spot in the den and I don't want to have to think of something to say and I don't want him to feel like he needs to say anything. I can't stand that clunky, awkward dance, I can't. 
I'm the lead in the school play this year and a lot of my siblings can't come, but my Uncle Karl is coming. I wince at the idea of looking out on the crowd and seeing a stranger who's my alleged family. What am I supposed to feel at that moment? I see my parents and siblings and feel familial love, but what about Uncle Karl? I don't know him. I don't know him at all and it feels all wrong. 
I know my uncle probably feels just as awkward as me, and I can empathize with his situation, but it doesn't mean my feelings aren't valid. 
My mom always says that the thing she most regrets about raising me is that I never had much of an extended family. I never knew them. But honestly, I think it's best I lived my life separate from my extended family and all their drama. I don't know if this is true for everyone, but it seems to me like everyone's cousins and aunts and uncles are crazy dysfunctional. The cousins my age are brats, and my older cousins have a lot of drug habits and too many kids for their age, and it's no wonder because their parents are equally dramatic and, well, crazy! My occasional visits give me headaches and anxiety like I can't explain. But, the worse part is I can never tell my mom, the person I most rely on, why I'm suddenly so anxious and awkward. 
I know I have to get over myself. My uncle Karl is actually the saner of my Uncles and is a nice person, but he's just lived around some trashy people, and he's in the situation he's in by no fault of his own, and it's the right thing for us to do, bringing him in. But that doesn't change the way I feel. Uncle Karl isn't really my family. He's "family." 
I'll learn to live with him because to my real family, Uncle Karl is family. 
It is hard because this is a family member, but you don't know him well. Things will be awkward because you don't know each other and you don't have much in common. You need to find something you have in common or something you at least enjoy a little. Just keep trying. You will figure it out. He cares about you and he wants to be included. Give him a chance. 
I would recommend going out on a limb and spending some time with them in an earnest attempt to get to know them better. Outside of the comfort zone is where the biggest rewards are.

You won't ever regret putting in the time, and you may end up with a lifelong friend. What I've come to learn is that family and friends are not mutually exclusive, and those people who happen to be both are truly a blessing.

Have a good one.

Thank you so much, guys! I didn't really expect anyone to reply, and I'm really surprised by the sincerity. I think I will take your advice, and again thank you for your warmth and positivity. 
All he does is sit around all day playing Minecraft. He is 13 and has practically dropped out of middle school (he's been homeschooled for 3 years and never does any of his school work). My mom never checks up on him to see how his school work is going so he gets away with just sitting on his computer playing games all day and lying to my Mom saying he did his school work. He is morbidly obese and literally the whole house shakes when he walks. He only walks to get food from the fridge or to go to the bathroom and then back to him computer. He never bathes or showers and hasn't changed his clothes in MONTHS. His stench is unbearable. My Dad bought him a 400$ bike and he never rides it. He lies about riding the bike and even about bathing himself. He is so gross, but unfortunately he's my brother and if my parents are unable to parent him properly then I feel like it's my problem... What is wrong with him?

This is going to be hard, but you need to report this to Child Protective services. He is being neglected. Your parents seem to have given up on him and someone needs to to step in. You don't have to leave your name in most states (if you are in the US). 
My brother was like this, he has Aspergers that my mother neglected and now he's 26, still living at home playing video games all day, and does nothing around the house. I made him get a job because I had a kid, and if he was going to sit around the house all day and do nothing while I worked, he could just watch the baby. He didn't like that idea so he went out and got a job so he could buy his own food, clothes, and gaming stuff. He has improved a little, having to go to work he showers more but his room is still so gross. Maybe it;ll get better, maybe not. Maybe he has some form of Aspergers/ is autistic. No one knows unless he goes and gets tested.
Keep him off 4chan
I agree, your brother needs the kind of help that most of us aren't trained to do. The 'We Tip Hotline' is a good place to call also, you DO NOT need to give your name and they will inform local services to help, not condemn your parents, but help your family. You are a good sibling! Sending love and strength to you.
Hi guys, I'm 23 years old girl. I lost my job 6 months ago, I was working in different city, far away from my home town. After that I had to move in with my parents again. We are good family that gets along very well except one point of view. They won't let me sleep over anywhere. Even over my best friend, they know her all my life and still they don't let me. They have been that way all my life, I tried to talk to him about that. They say it's inappropriate and that I'm under their roof. I lived by myself for about 3 years in different city, now it's silly to me that they are acting this way. They made me come home through very rough neigborhood in 3 AM in the morning. I had to drive from another city home after my friends wedding even though I could sleep there etc. It's insane. I don't know what to do anymore, I only know I can't move somewhere else right now.
That is ridiculous. Unfortunately, you are stuck unless you can strike up a compromise or move out.
Maybe they still haven't gotten the point that you're an adult and you can determine your own choices? I can see why they use the "you're living under my roof" excuse, but they need to understand that you have lived independently for 3 years already, and have done well wihtout these rules. I think you're going to need to make a compromise with them, or remind them that you're a full grown adult.
Alright so this started since March last year me and my cousin hadn't seen each other since we were both 4 She's 17 now and im 18
anyway she came over with her mum and dad for a holiday in NZ and we put them up and they were great to have over


After they left i asked if could come over and they said yes and my cousin was actively encouraging me to come and said she is so excited to have me over 


Anyway come December and i'm here in the UK
My cousin was over the moon that i'm here and she said she wants to show me everything and do loads of things with me

A few weeks later she left her Facebook signed in and i saw her and her boyfriend ( she met in October ) slagging me off behind my back 

They were calling me a creep weirdo perv knob spreading lies about me saying i should watch them have sex  ect 


Her boyfriend who i really dislike has been doing sexual acts to her in front of me like groping her boobs and bending her over in front of me and slapping her bum repeatedly an saying yeah you like that don't you and whispering to her how was my D!ck last night when im in the same room and it really disturbs me 

I told my other Aunt who lives within the Area and my mum whats been happening and they said they're both being immature and bullies and they said i should confront my cousin about it 

So i confronted her about it and she said she is so sorry and she's not used to having me around although I've been around for months now anyway there was about 3 days of apologizing about what she did then she started slagging me off again 

She started asking me if i wanted to go to parties i say sure lets go and she tells me not to bother going at the last minute and she and her boyfriend were ranting on to each other about how im a little nosy mong who should mind his own business 

Im just annoyed right now i have never mouthed off at her I've never offended her at least i don't think i have. 

we were supposed to be family not this if anyone could give some advice i would appreciate it


Stay away from her?
She sounds like a lot of drama. She isn't worth the trouble.
its a bit difficult when i have to live with her for a year
My little brother turned 7 and my Dad told me he loves Paw Patrol, so I bought him a bunch of Paw Patrol stuff, a card, and a game for his slightly older brother. It was great to show love in a simple way, I guess.
Aww! That is great.
There's nothing like being a good big brother!
My brother was married for about 15 years to a wonderful woman whom we all adored.  She had what is usually considered a very manageable auto-immune disorder but began showing signs of liver damage a few years back as a complication of the disorder.  The birth of their fourth child two years ago marked the beginning of the end.  The birth itself nearly killed her due to hemorrhage and her body just never fully recovered.  She got sicker and sicker.   Her liver began to fail completely.  My brother spent all of their savings and all of his time (left his work almost completely) trying to save her.  New doctors, new treatments, alternative medicine, one hospital stay after another.  Nothing could be done.  She even told him to move on and remarry as soon as he was ready because she knew she wouldn't make it.  He refused to accept the ending of her life and fought to keep her alive and with them until the last few weeks.  Finally she begged not to go to the hospital anymore and he provided round the clock hospice care for her himself in their home.  She passed away surrounded by her husband and children.  The whole family was devastated even though we knew it was coming. 

Her funeral was a few months ago in October.  We had all anticipated her passing for a long time but I don't think anyone but my mother (who stayed with them to help with her care and the children) really understood that my brother had been without a spouse and functioning as a single parent for years before her passing.

A little over a month ago my brother went on a dating site.  He let my siblings and I know a few weeks ago that he met someone and was dating her exclusively.  My brother is Mormon and quick courtship and engagements are common so I was mentally preparing myself for him to progress quickly even though I was hoping he wouldn't  Tonight he texted me saying he had proposed and they were engaged.  Way sooner than even my wildest imagination had guessed.

I burst into tears immediately.  I don't want my sister-in-law to be gone.  But I know my brother being single won't bring her back.  The thought of someone stepping into her place hurts so viscerally.  But in the back of my mind I understand that my brother has been alone for a long time and has been craving a companion.  He wants his kids to have a mother figure.  My sister in law wanted that too and told him to find someone who would love their kids as soon as he was ready.  He's not the type to do well on his own.  I know he needs someone. I want him to be happy.

My biggest concern is that this is still part of his grief.  That this is a rebound and it's too soon for him to really know this woman and if they're ready to make a family together.  I'd hate for him to look at his life a year from now and find that it's not what he hoped it would be.  Or worse- what if they came to the point of divorce some time in the future?  Alone again and even more wounded?  I'm worried about him. I have no idea how to express it.  I know he's aware of how fast this is and that everyone is a bit taken aback.  Right now I'm trying to be understanding and supportive. I'm emphasizing that I want him to be happy and that I know he's been alone a long time.  Those are true feelings.  But I'm keeping the pain and the worry to myself.  I'm just not sure what to do.  In the end it's his decision and we're not really close enough for me to expect my concerns to change his mind about anything...  but I just feel... worried.  I don't know how else to explain it.

It's strange to still be so close to her death that I worry about hurting him but for that to also coincide with him getting engaged.

tl:dr  Sister in law died of long, wasting illness over the course of a few years and told my brother not to wait around after she died and not to be alone too long.  Brother has been lonely a long time and basically single parent to 4 kids due to her debilitating illness.  He just got engaged 3.5 months after her death.  He knows he's moving really fast.  He wants to move on and I'm trying to be understanding and supportive.  Feeling very conflicted and concerned.
I am very sorry for your loss and I do understand your concern. He hasn't known this woman long and that in and of itself is concerning. That said, he is an adult and you can't make him do anything he doesn't want to do. Let him know you love him and are there for him. He is likely going to do this with or without your consent.
This might be a part of his grief, but everyone grieves differently. I know this hurts but this isn't a choice you can make for him. It might end in divorce a year from now, but all you can do is try to be welcoming and supportive. That's what he needs most.
 Hi every one,

A little background info:  I am a first time Mommy and I am currently four months pregnant. I am typically a quiet, private, kind of girl and that's the environment in which I was raised. My parents and I don't have the best relationship due to their own issues. I have basically raised myself and as a result, I have become a fairly independent woman. I am a person who typically has no problem speaking my mind very directly to people, especially when I feel like they have over stepped their boundaries.

My boyfriend's mother is from the complete opposite end of the spectrum and unlike any other parent I have ever met in real life. She is obsessive, needy, passive-aggressive, paranoid, and extremely jealous of everyone. She constantly needs attention to feel loved and is overly emotional/childish about everything. If someone says something nice to me she literally storms out of the house in a fit of jealousy or tries to win attention back by comparing the compliment to something she has done "better".

SO is 26 years old and you would think he was 10 by the way she speaks to him. Constantly forcing her way into literally doing everything for him despite how many times he insists she doesn't. For example; If she is around and he is trying to cook a meal for himself she will find a way to snatch the spoon out of his hand and start cooking for him. Or how she will waltz into our home and start folding our laundry.  Now, this may seem like standard mom/son tendencies, but she literally will not let him live his own life just so she can feel needed which has kind of made him a dependent, unmotivated, person. 

Anyways, the woman has always had a secret hatred for me. She hates that her other son and her husband like me and think that I am a good fit for SO. When ever something good happens to me she always pretends to be happy but the jealousy is so apparent in her tone of voice that its almost sad. Any small talk I try to make becomes a competitive response. For example; When I was in college she was going to school to be a medical assistant  and would constantly ask what my assignments were and what I scored on tests just so she could have an opportunity to say "Well I got a point higher" (very childish).   She is constantly talking about me to her other son saying that I am an outsider in the family even though I have been with her son for over 5 years. If SO spends money on me for Christmas or hears that we went out to eat she just demands that she get those things too or just puts on a sour puss face.  She has the maturity level of a teenage girl.

Now that I am pregnant she is acting extra crazy/obsessive towards me and given the history of my encounters with her, I am not too happy about any of it.  She has been rubbing my belly without asking since 8 weeks...(yes when the baby is the size of a pea). We had to tell her that early so that she would stop being such a b*tch to me all the time (which is working for now). She asked me if she could come to the first ultrasound (Which is just something no one should ever ask to do. It is a private moment for the couple to share !) and then guilted me and cried when I said no . She wants to be in the room with me while I am giving birth (I don't even want my own mother in the delivery room, nevermind her). She will pull me aside and literally cry about how we are not letting her be involved because I don't want her coming to the OBGYN with me and looking at my who-ha.  The other day she said out of the blue "Don't be sad if your child is disabled." I am still in my early stages of pregnancy, WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT IN SOMEONE'S HEAD?! Today she called me and asked how my appointment went with my midwife (she didn't use a midwife so she has been trying to steer me away from using one). I told her the appointment went great and that SO and I like and trust her a lot and she responded "I'm going to need to meet her soon." as if this has anything to do with her at all. The appointment itself was just a quick urine sample, they checked the baby's heartbeat and my blood pressure and that was about it. She was upset that I am not keeping her "updated". Now I haven't had the autonomy done yet so I know as much as she does at this point and I don't really know what to update her on. I  explained that there isn't much to tell and she replied with "What do you mean.. nothing to tell?!" I lashed back with "Well, if you need to know how my blood pressure and urine sample went, it went well. Other than that, there is nothing to tell". I can't stand this woman.

With the addition of the hormones and my already direct personality, I am really finding it difficult to keep saying things nicely. I have tried basically all the nice tactics. I have had SO explain the desire for privacy, I have personally said things directly and indirectly. I have let her know that my own mother is not being included in these events either so she should not take it personally. For some strange reason, although I can't say I like the woman very much at all at this point, I haven't just screamed at her like I have wanted to but I feel the moment is soon approaching. I just feel like I have exhausted all options at this point. She is just so over emotional about everything and possibly has some undiagnosed psychological issues that I don't want to make worse. BUT, it's MY baby.

God help me never be like this woman. I am so stressed out that she will ruin this whole experience for me (she already is in a way). That she will try to come over everyday and not leave the hospital when the baby is born or just show up in the delivery room uninvited. That she will make comments about me to my child to try to me him/her dislike me like she has done with others.  I fear for her because I have a feeling I will stop being nice cuss her out at some point if she keeps this up.

I would just like to hear some successful experiences in dealing with this or even just some other crazy stories to make me feel better about her because I can't take it anymore.
I'm sorry you are going through this.  Especially on your first child. Put your foot down and don't give in. This is a private affair and she's not invited.  Also, give her the number to a good psychiatrist. She has something going on that's not good. 
You and your boyfriend need to have boundaries or this woman will walk all over you. Set boundaries and stick to them. This could mean no contact, no answering the phone, etc. Your mother in law sounds like a complete narcist. Expect it to be worse before it gets better.  But you have to be firm.don't allow her to throw a temper tantrum and get her way.
I agree that there is 100% something wrong upstairs in this woman's head. People have recommended she seek therapy for years now but she just thinks everyone else is the problem. I just need to try to not let her get to me so much and look at her as a person with mental illness. Thank you all for the replies :)
You can start by cutting off information to her. If she doesnt know you have a doctors appointment she doesnt have the opportunity to ask you about it or invite herself. If she doesnt know when you go into labor or where you are delivering than she wont be able to show up without permission etc. And before the baby comes you and your SO need to sit her and your fil down and make some clear boundaries. And add the consequences for those boundaries. IE- she is not to show up uninvited to your home. If she does, the consequence is that not only will she not be allowed in but you will also put her in a time out for a set period of time. When she is in time out if she persists and will not leave you alone the time out gets extended. go over to r/justnomil and talk about it there. They are very helpful and trust me youre not the first person to deal with a jealous MIL Its super super common.
Thanks so much. It's good to know I am not the only one dealing with these crazy people. SO definitely needs to be the one to lay down the law because she just ignores any boundaries that I try and set. Very frustrating, but that's life!
Well you can start by telling him he is absolutely violating your trust by giving his mother information about your doctors and pregnancy without asking you. My SO wouldn't dare tell his mother my private info without asking me because that is what a healthy relationship is about- you keep eachother and each others business safe and between you two . 
Secondly you can stop communicating with her all together . Start by telling her that after repeated attempts by you to establish boundaries like no touching your belly and keeping your pregnancy private she has not taken you seriously and you don't want to communicate with her anymore. I would absolutely do this if I were you. Or you can let her keep ruining your pregnancy experience - it's up to you
I have an aunt and two cousins who genuinely hate me. They hate me because I had a wedding 3 years ago with only a few close friends and some family. They RSVP'd and added +1's that I've never met before (SO's they never cared to introduce). I kindly asked them to drop their dates because it was a smaller wedding. 

They were furious. Told me I should kick 2 friends off the guest list so they could have dates because family comes first. I told them I wouldn't do that. 

First they boycotted my wedding. Honestly I didn't give a shit because they'd been shitty family all my life anyway. Then they decided to show and - no shit - bring their SO's I asked them to leave behind. At the wedding I didn't let this fuckery get to me and greeted their table with a smile. They ignored my presence. 

A few days before this past Thanksgiving (3 years later) my sister dropped the hint they were boycotting Thanksgiving at my parent's house because they heard I was coming home. My dad gets upset when family is all torn up so for the sake of his happiness, I thought I'd apologize for upsetting them so maybe we could put this dumb shit behind us.

Their response was explosive...  "u took so long to apologize for somethin that shouldn't have never happened," "who da fuck say I wasn't coming?" "u only apologizing cuz u heard we wasn't gonna come." These uneducated people actually thought they were entitled to an apology. Incredible.

I went home for Thanksgiving and sure enough they didn't show. My aunt did show, 2 hours after dinner, and ignored me the whole time. Apparently she's in on it.

Today on Christmas Eve, I called my dad because I couldn't get home on leave. He told me they were there. I told him to tell them hello even though they probably didn't want to hear from me. He quickly changed the subject. 

Oh well, at least my in laws are rad, and my life isn't miserable like theirs. 

Merry Christmas!


Honestly they sound like real pieces of shit. Screw that family! Get a dingo one instead!!!
Screw them. If family tried that shit with my kids they would no longer be invited to celebrate the holidays with us. It is ridiculous and petty that they have continued a fued, especially when they were in the wrong.
Why would you not allow family to being their Significant Other / wives / husbands / boyfriends / girlfriends? It's very normal to bring regardless if you met them or not.  Everybody does it and it happens all the time.  Don't know why you would think otherwise unless there's a personal reason, grudge, or something.

Even if it is a small wedding, having family members bring a few +1's isn't a big deal unless you have financial problems, on a super strict low budget wedding, and have issues paying for the food & cake (cuz they count heads).  In that case, set up a donations stand or gofundme.com online fundraiser, to help fund the wedding.  

You should take charge again and do the talking to your aunt and two cousins, squash it.  A weak introvert, too quiet, reserve shy person would not be able to do anything.  Be the bigger person and talk to them, solve it for once and for all.
Weddings are about celebrating someone's marriage, not about bringing your girlfriend on a fucking date. I don't care if it's "pretty normal." If you make it between going to a family member's wedding or bringing a date, then you know you're being an entitled fuck. 

I only wanted a few people there, I wanted it to be more intimate and that was my choice. To demand a date or show up with a date despite the bride/grooms wishes is complete disrespect. It's the principle, not whether it's a "big deal" or not that they brought their +1. If you need to have a date to celebrate someone's wedding then you've got your priorities all kinds of fucked up lol. 

To set up a fundraiser for a wedding just shows financial irresponsibility. So that's out of the question. Thanks though.

I think you read over what I said above about apologizing for upsetting them and how they had an explosive response regardless. Believe me, I tried my heart out! If people don't want something to be fixed, then why am I going to waste my time? 
If it is a small wedding, they should be able to come without guests. They were still being invited. Not everyone can afford for others to bring a plus one. They shouldn't need to.
Because it's not their wedding? I don't want randoms I've never met be the reason I can't have my friends at my special day.
100% agree. It's not about them! But apparently they're entitled to a +1!

awwww that is cute fam i vote

also really good sweater, she is very good.
I just met a guy on the subway on my way home. 0:30 o'clock. U1 from Warschauer Straße, he got on at about Kottbusser Tor. Looks like a tough guy. Sits half on me when sitting down. I scoot over a bit, we play some leg wrestling. He starts talking about the woman sitting opposite of us who's looking at her phone. He is rude, but still playful, not too offensive, not aggressive. I pick up the conversation, try to keep it civil, argue politely with him, smile. He is actually sincere. At about Nollendofplatz he shows me a picture of his two children. They are gorgeous. He's my age, his kids are my kids' age. We get off together at Wittenbergplatz. He obviously wants to talk. He's been married seven years but separated now, he loves his kids more than anything in the world. He was at his daughter's kindergarten Christmas party tonight, and felt how his distance to her was growing bigger. I see his tears streaming down his face. He looks like a friendly father now. He tells me more about how seeing or thinking about another "father" picking up and cuddling his kids just 'breaks' him. I am dumbstruck. I give him a hug. We talk a while and say goodbye. I come home, write this, and cry -- for him, I guess. 

We should only judge people once we actually get to know them.

What do all the petty things matter in life? What matters most are family and friends.
Thank you so much for sharing and being kind tonthisbman who really needed you tonight. It is a very tough time of year to be away from your kids and separating is rough. 

I was just saying to my husband that I am old because the best part of Christmas is spending time with everyone and seeing my kids happy. 
Wonderful story! All the pettiness is so unnecessary when you really think about it. 

I loved reading this. I'm going to share! 
I was under the impression that it skips a generation? 
Yay!!! And the only kind of genetics that play in to twins is fraternal. But statistically, some identical twin will have identical twins.
Congratulations! Anyone can have twins at any time. It isn't necessarily genetic. Enjoy your new niblings (I love that word and never get to use it!)!
Congratulations!!
When I was a kid, my mom used to work early mornings but she also owned her own business so she would have employees at the house even tho she wasn't there. My dad was a construction worker, and would leave early as well. One day, tho, when I was about 7 or 8, I remember waking up and hearing voices in my parents room. I didn't think anything of it until I was eating cereal and watching cartoons when my dad and one of my mom's employees walked down the hall. My dad tried to cover it up by asking her if she thought my mom would like some "gift" my dad bought her. Bullshit. Even at 7 or 8 I knew what was going on. 

I've never said anything but still remember every detail of that morning. I'll be 30 this year. 
Children shouldn't get pulled into their parents' lies. It is unfair. I am sorry you went through that.
If you are still bothered about it 20+ years later you need to talk about it.  I would recommend you visit a therapist.

My 21 year old son who was raised solely by my husband of less than a year has saved me in his new phone as "mom". He's never been close to anyone my husband has been with until me. I'm so proud and crying now.
Hello everybody, my 2-year old son (almost 3) has been occasionally watching YouTube when he eats his lunches throughout the week. He recently started watching a bunch of "Toy Review" channels and told me he liked them, but wished the people would "just play!" 

My son LOVES to use his imagination and we spend every single minute of my 2 days off during the week playing, going on adventures, and just having TONS of fun. So, as a surprise I decided to purchase a few GoPro cameras to help make my little buddy's dream come true. He was, to say lightly, extremely excited. 

I started "The Gabriel Show" for him about a month ago, and slowly but surely we have begun shooting videos and uploading them. Luckily, I major in computer science and spent a ridiculous amount of time during my childhood doing video production in school...so, I also do all the editing. :) (Full-time worker, full-time Dad, and full-time video producer and editor) lol

My fiance is a stay-at-home mom but has never edited a video in her life, so I'm thinking of slowly teaching her to edit videos to help alleviate some of the extra work I am doing...but, alas' I will do anything for my children. :)

If any of you Redditors have children and they occasionally watch YouTube to pass the time, please feel free to watch our show and let us know what you think! My son asks me to check the "views" every day to see if any other "kids" have watched his show. :)

Any feedback, likes, subscribes, or comments are much appreciated and I will have my son respond to as many people as he decides he wants to. 

Thanks guys!

Will he email, or respond in crayon?  
Of course! He loves to respond to people, and he actually grasps that he is speaking to people across the world. If you ever have any questions, I would love to give him the opportunity to respond in his own creative way. :)
First off, I'm a reddit lurker. I rarely post and would greatly appreciate opinions and advice. Here's the situation: I am 20 years old, recent college graduate, and am a pretty positive girl. However, about 5 years ago, my mom lost her job due to her slew of illnesses and I've been taking care of her since then. My family, which includes my father and older sister, has offered very little help. My mom is not an easy patient but she's also in a lot of pain all of the time and I seem to be the only one that understands. Fast forward to about 3 months ago and my father (separated from my mom) had a massive stroke that paralyzed the entire right side of his body. He lived with us for about a year until this happened and is now in rehab for recovery. My sister, her girlfriend, and my 2 year old nephew moved in to our 3 bedroom house and I worked most of the time to bring in the money that we lost from my dad. She eventually got sick of it (as usual) and bolted the minute things got tough. And she created a hell of a scene in the process, saying extremely mean things to me and my mom. She's acted like a sociopath for most of her life so that's not a shocker. She's been taking care of my grandmother (I say that lightly) for 3 years on and off and stole a lot of money from her in the process. So when my grandmother's temporary caregiver moved away, she moved in with all of us and my sister pretty much left her here for me to take care of on top of everything else. Fast forward to now and I am on a leave of absence from my job, which is being threatened if I don't return in August, I am taking care of both my grandmother (who is in stage 6/7 of alzheimer's) and my mother who is also extremely physically sick. We have exhausted all avenues of help. Can't put her in a nursing home, due to lack of funds. Can't ask for state help because she has "too much" money, home health is too expensive, and we are considering admitting her to the nursing home for hospice care. My dad has cussed me multiple times for not bringing him home and I pretty much handed the responsibility over to his family and my sister so there's that. I have no contact with my sister because well, I hate her for leaving us the way she did. My mom is worried that I'll do the same. We're also broke as hell. The only joy I have in my life is my fiance and he's been more than patient and helpful in this situation, so I'm lucky there but it's put a huge strain on our alone time. I'm just feeling really depressed and anxiety ridden lately and I feel as if I won't be able to move on with my own life due to taking care of everyone else's. I don't really have a choice not to take care of my mom, because then my conscience would eat me alive. I feel selfish for feeling the way I do but I can't help it. Any advice? 
**No mean or rude comments about my family please. I love them and I'm very protective over them. Thanks!

What area do you live in?
I am sorry for all you are going through. Are you sure there isn't state assistance you can apply for? It sounds like you would qualify for something, especially when it comes to your grandma,  although understand it can be difficult to get the help. Does your mom qualify for disability? I would see if you can get social services involved. They aren't just for children. I don't know what else there is to do.

Your sister is a lost cause. I doubt she will ever be there to help. Your father also has to deal. You are doing all you can. You are in over your head as it is. I wish I had good advice. I really don't know what you can do. My husband's grandma qualified for hospice (she also had Alzheimer's) but she was at the very end and they only offer services for six months or less. Best of luck. If you ever need to talk, I am here any time. Hang in there. You are amazing to be doing. So much for your family. They are lucky to have you. 
I don't have anything to offer but internet hugs! Awesome job stepping up to the plate, even if it is super large! 
Thank you so much for your comment. It really helps knowing that I'm not the only one out there who lives with the same circumstances as myself. 
I took care of my grandfather w/ alzheimers.  There are groups out there that can help.  I can't really offer much help without location but try looking up for some on google in your region.
Thanks to everyone that posted a reply! For some reason, I can't see a couple of the comments. But.. 
In response to viperbunny, hospice care is her only option at this point and we're waiting to find out if she qualifies for that. She should considering her condition and she is in her last stages, according to her doctor. Thanks! 
In response to jezzela, I appreciate your kind words and Internet hugs. It means more than you know. 
I'm 24. For my entire life, I've never been able to have deep conversations with my family. I enjoy things like science, art, history, music, etc., but they only want to talk about superficial things like sports or TV. If something doesn't directly pertain to them, they don't care. They say I'm too serious for talking about science, art, etc., but I just think they're interesting.

If something happens in my life, they don't care beyond chastising actions they don't like or briefly saying good job when I have an accomplishment. But it seems like its just words.

For example, a close friend of mine was sexually assaulted. My parents got mad that I was angry over it and told me to find something to do with my time. They basically said that because it didn't happen to them, my brother, or me that they don't care. They don't want to hear it. They gaslight me, acting like I'm crazy for caring about these things. It's normal to get emotional in these situations right? Or am I just crazy? They stand for nothing, yet act like they're morally righteous.

They make me feel like I'm insane for caring about the world and wanting to learn. They only talk about how hard they work and of course, they each say they do everything. They make everything stressful and act like they have it so hard. Yet they are in the top 10% of income in the US, have a big house, cars, go out to eat, take vacations, etc.


Sorry that you are living this type of life.  But you must recognise that it is not going to change.  Trying to get attention or admiration from them is pointless.  So if you keep trying all you will be doing is banging your head on a brick wall.  What I had to do was just leave and find my happiness elsewhere. I hung with people that had the same frame of mind as I did.  Think about it.  Is moving on a better path for you?  Make sure you are also thankful for what you did learn under your parents roof.  
I have a younger brother (21) and sister (20). The legal matters are being handled by my mother. My sister is an absolute wreck. I don't know what to do. I'm just looking for any sort of advice or help. This sucks so bad. 

He fought so hard, it happened so quick in 3 weeks. Admitted for pancreatitis from severe alcoholism, then a c. Diff infection ended up with septic shock and a perforated small intestines. The repair didnt seal and it is leaking and nothing more can be done. No more operations due to liver and kidney failure. He just got back mentally from hepatic encephalopathy and i thought he was going to make it. But he did not have the strength for the intestine to seal.
Ah fuck I'm so sorry.. my thoughts are with you today my friend.
I am sorry you are going through this. The biggest thing is to let yourself feel what you feel. Shock is common. It may not hit you all at once. It is okay to cry. It is okay if you don't cry. Laughter is great medicine. Let others feel as they feel. Help where you can.
I just feel terrible that I couldn't save him. He had been a severe alcoholic for 2 years since my mother left him. How can I go on without this man who has always been my hero?
We make our own choices. He made the choice to drink and only he could choose to stop. It sucks. Feeling helpless is terrible. You want to feel like you could do something to change things, but that just isn't the case. 

Unfortunately, our heroes aren't invincible. Hold onto the love you have for him. That is yours to keep forever. Remember the good times. Remember the things that made him your hero. It is okay to be angry or hurt. Grief is a process. It is going to take a while and that is okay. Let people help you. 

I am here if you want to talk. I have been through some tough losses and I know it can be lonely. You are not alone.
Thank you for your reply, it was really good. 
The past 2 years have been tough for everyone since my mother left him. At the same time, I had my 5 yr girlfriend break up with me after college. It was all so much at once, I feel like I just crawled out of a dark place these past few months. It really sucks to be pushed back down there after so long. We still have our mom for support but it's difficult nonetheless. 
How can I find the strength to carry on? What can I do? I already have a tendency to avoid being alone for prolonged periods of time due to the last bout of depression. 
Therapy helps. Really. It can feel like one bad thing after another. Unfortunately, the universe doesn't stop, even when it feels like your whole world is crashing down. Take things slowly. Get through an hour, then a day and just keep going. Accept that it is going to be a tough time for a while and be patient with yourself. Find something to focus on. Small tasks that you can finish. It may seem like an impossible thing, but you will make it through this.
In private conversations with my 6 year old niece (call her M. for short), as well as just witnessing their regular interactions, I have discovered that my sister (call her J for short) is royally screwing up the mental state of my niece.  M relentlessly nags and lectures J over everything, right down to making simple, uneducated mistakes like picking out green bananas instead of yellow ones.  Many of M's typical  actions are criticized unnecessarily by J in my presence,  and M has very candidly told me that no matter what she does, even when she is "trying to help", she just frustrates J, leaving  M feeling "worthless" and "alone" (M's exact words)....a very brave and poignant emotion to convey as an only child at a young age. M has now developed nervous ticks and blatantly expresses a fear of making J "frustrated".  I am sickened by this and want to do something, but don't know what. When I confronted J about this she gives me a "so what? " response. J is married but I don't know if talking to her husband is the best idea.  I know J's husband is also aware of J's unnecessarily angry responses to just about everything, but hasn't done a thing and I don't know why.  It's my sweet and caring and sensitive niece I'm most worried about.  Should I say something, but to who and how?
This is awful. It is great that you want to help. Make sure your niece knows she can come to you. This is emotional abuse, but unfortunately, CPS is not likely to help. I would talk to J's husband and  J again. Make sure to keep supporting your niece. Let her know you are there for her. Having someone to trust makes a difference. 
Thanks for your feedback.  I almost cried today to hear my niece tell me this story in confidence.....not an hour after I witnessed J nag M to death over not wanting to go for a walk.  A WALK!  I don't have kids, but I can see when someone is scared and hurt.  M is very clearly telling her mom, right in front of me, that she doesn't want to do something but she'll go along because she "doesn't want to make mommy mad".... but mommy gets mad over EVERYTHING...especially really petty small stuff.  J's job is wearing her out and she's taking it out on her child.  I HATE seeing this.
Has your sister always been like this? She sounds like she loves to feel powerful and to make others feel helpless. This is a real issue. I feel so bad so your niece. You may not be a parent, but your instincts are 100% right on this. I have two daughters and I can't even imagine treating my kids like this. Sometimes you need to nag to get kids to do things when they have to do them, but not all the time. Kids need to be kids. They are going to make mistakes. My dad used to berate me for mistakes and then crying. If it was an honest mistake I don't get mad at my kids. That is how they learn. Even if your niece somehow managed the impossible and became person, her mom would find something to nag. Make sure she knows that.
Also my sister claims that she has to nag her daughter constantly....yet I can convince my niece to comply with very little reinforcement.  Is it an age thing?  Is she just balking at her parents because she's testing them?  Does she not test me because I'm an outsider to the immediate family?
I just want my sister to get help.  Yes, she's been like this 4 a long time.   Her husband has confided with me that he sees it but is scared of her or something.  I tried to explain it to her today as a "picture how you would feel if" scenario, but it fell on deaf ears.  I'm worried that she'll take the course of medicating a perfectly normal, passionate 6 year old just to give mommy some down time.  I witnessed her sugar the crap out of her kid then complain that she has ADD.  Later on, my niece and I were horseplaying and I fell and got hurt, and my niece freaked out nd frozelike it was her fault, but it was totally my fault.  I tried really hard to tell her that it was NOT her fault, but her mom blamed her.  That made me so mad.  My sister's husband can't do much because my sister is hyoer-srnsitive to everything, and all suggestions for self-help fall on deaf ears.  I want my niece to feel comfortable talking to someone, but I can't help her and an outside source (school counselor, etc)  might get her in trouble.  My attempts are failing.  I am at a loss for what to do, but I can see my niece is struggling with this situation. 
I mean, it can be. Kids can be difficult. Kids are also going to be better behaved for people who aren't their parents. It still sounds like there are bigger issues. 
If your brother in law is scared of your sister too, that sounds like a big issue. She isn't going to change. She enjoys this power play. She does need help, but that won't help unless she is willing to change. Your niece needs to be away from her, but that won't happen unless her dad steps up to the plate.
Life is still the same if not worse for my family.   My bro-in-law ran away to Oregon for a week to get away from my nagging sister.  He's still out there.  It's a real shame.  I feel sorry for my niece.
I am about to be a grandmother for the second time but wanted some help in dealing with my daughter-in-law. She does not let me have any say in the raising of my grandson. He is the first and I was so excited to pass down all the family heirlooms that I saved from when my children were young. I have everything- clothes, highchair, bassinet, all the toys, etc- in the attic but she wanted none of it except some clothes. I've tried to explain to my son that these items are very important to me and that it would mean the world if they used it but they wanted all new things.

I don't know what to . Everything I did with my kids she tells me is wrong. She doesn't want any advice from me regarding breastfeeding, sleeping, etc. even though I have 5 children and would consider myself a pretty great mom.

She doesn't put a jacket on him in the car, she refused to feed him baby food out of a jar when he was younger, she has put him in daycare instead of staying home to raise him - I just see her making so many choices that I don't agree with and I have no say. I can't even give my grandson candy without her getting upset. And it is almost like my whole family agrees with her and gets on my case as well.

We weren't allowed in the room for the birth of our grandson, although her mother was, we weren't allowed to stay for longer than an hour at a time and not while other visitors were there, and my son wasn't allowed celebrate with up that night. Now with the birth of our second grandson looming, I am fearful that I am going to be upset about these things all over again. My son has already told us that grandson will be visiting the baby first and on his own and I would really like to be there to celebrate as well and see my grandson meet his baby brother as well.

How can I make her see that her choices and my lack of involvement are hurting me? Right now my grandson doesn't even want to be around me because of the things that she is doing and it hurts my heart. My family is so close and I rarely get to see my son and grandson now because of her and none of the things that I saved to passed down are being put to use like I imagined. I just don't know what to do. 
Sorry, Grandma, but you are out of line.  How your son and DIL raise their child is not up to you and the recommendations you are making and things you think are okay are currently out-of-date and incorrect based upon actual scientific research.

1) You are not supposed to put a jacket on a child in a car seat.  Doing so leaves extra room between the child and the straps and could allow the child to slip out of the carseat during a crash.

2) You are not supposed to feed solids (including babyfood) prior to a certain age.  That age is a decision only Mom and Dad get to make.

3) MANY Mothers nowdays choose to work outside of the home because they want more purpose out of life or they HAVE to work outside of the home due to finances.  They do not have the luxury you did "way back then" to be able to financially survive on a single income.  Be grateful you had that choice, most moms now don't.  

4) I have no plans to have children, but there is an absolutely 0% chance that I would ever allow my MIL in the birthing room if I did.  My MIL has absolutely no business seeing my crotch.  You can sit in the waiting room with other people that you DIL doesn't want to see her private parts.

5) This baby is NOT about you.  Repeat that to yourself over and over and over again.  Your son is having a child because he wants a child.  He is not having a child FOR you.  How they raise their child is 100% up to them.  You should really consider calmly and quietly falling in line with their wishes or they may just stop allowing you to see your grandchildren all together.
It's obvious that you care very much about being a grandmother and being involved. But I have to say that the level of involvement that you hope to have seems far less about an emotional bond and much more about your own control. You can be emotionally connected and close to your grandchildren without meddling in your son and daughter in law's lives. 

The sentimental value of the baby gear you've saved may be of importance to you, but your son and daughter in law are under no obligation to use them. Safety is most important, as others have said, and your son and daughter in law want to choose their own items, which they should! Your advice regarding breastfeeding or other topics is, I'm sorry to say, completely unwanted. And as far as meeting the new grandbaby alongside your son and his wife and firstborn - that is a very special and private moment for their family.

I have to add that while it may be easy to assume your daughter in law is the one who is resistant to your help, advice, etc., it's just that: an assumption. There is A LOT that my MIL says/does that my husband asks me to "handle." 

Your son and daughter in law are a team and if you want to be considered an ally, I respectfully suggest that you leave your ego at the door. 
You are the one who is being controlling here. Your daughter in law seems to be doing it right. It makes sense she allowed her mother into the delivery room. She has a life time relationship with her mother and wanted the comfort and support. She wasn't looking to have an audience while she gave birth. Unless she asks for tips on breastfeeding and feeding, that is up to her. You shouldn't be commenting. As others have said, kids aren't supposed to wear jackets in the car. It is dangerous. 

Did you ever stop to think the things you are trying to give DIL are either not her style or she doesn't want to use because of safety reason. A lot has changed. Hell, things have changed between the time I had my 4 year old, to my almost 3 year old, to my 1 year old niece. You need to trust that she is following the recommendations that are available right now. Also, it is really unfair to judge her for working. It is very hard to be a single income family these days. Also, there is nothing wrong with wanting to work. Lots of kids go to daycare and are just fair. I stay home with my kids, but I know some people who work full time, some part time, some stay home. They all love their kids and are doing what is best for their family as a whole. That is up to your son and daughter in law and you have no place in that decision.

They get to decide who is there to meet the new baby, and when and for how long. You are worried about things being special for you and forgetting what is special for them as a family. You keep saying how hurt you are without any consideration to what you are doing to her. You are making a lot of demands and none of them seems reasonable, which is why she is likely limiting contact. It's what I would do too. You should like my mother in law and mother when my husband or I don't take their advice. Yes, you raised kids. That is great. These aren't YOUR kids. These are their kids to raise how they see fit. Things are not the same as the past. So much has changed. You could be the best mom to ever have lived and it still would not be your place to comment. If you want to be a great grandma then you need to stop making this about you. Support the decisions your son and daughter in law make. You don't have to agree with them. You need to show you aren't working against them or being negative about them. What you are saying to them is they are not good enough parents, whether you mean to or not. You should only care that your grandkids are happy and healthy and doing well. Stop trying to be their mom and stick to being a grandma. You will all be better off that way. I apologize if this comes off harsh. My intention is not to rude or mean, but to explain to you that you are not in the right on this one. I am sure you love them all very much, but you are the one who needs to let go.
It's not your problem.


I agree with the other comments. I also hear your need for inclusion and closeness with your son and his family. Those are perfectly natural desires, and it's important for you to feel happy and content, but your feelings are your responsibility, not theirs.

 From what you've described, your idea of inclusion is for your advice to be heeded, and to be physically present ...in the room...for some very personal and emotional moments. I bet you can find better ways to meet your needs. 

Consider from her perspective, being completely exposed in a room full of people...including someone who is likely judging her performance and choices. Her need for some privacy is very reasonable. 

I recommend brainstorming other ways to be involved, that don't include giving unsolicited advice. You are more likely to be invited for more/longer visits if they don't feel judged. 
Ask them how you can help. Ask which treats would be acceptable alternatives to candy, or maybe candy is okay if limited to one or two pieces, and he has to brush his teeth afterwards?  Maybe you can set up those baby supplies at your house for when they visit. 

Remember, just because you and she make different choices does not mean anyone is strictly "wrong", but rather you had children in a very different context. Trust and accept that they are making decisions out of love and dedication to their children. 

I hope you find a happy balance as a grandma.

I agree with this 100%. 

A lot of standards and advice have changed since you were parenting young children. Safety standards have changed for cribs, high chairs, bassinets, etc. Candy is bad for kids. Baby food can be full of junk, a lot of parents now do baby led weaning where the baby eats real food. 

If you feel disconnected from your grandchildren, maybe you can offer to babysit the older one occasionally to give mom & dad time alone with the new baby? But you have to show that you are willing to follow their rules when watching him. Maybe those toys you have saved can be special "grandmas house" toys. 
This is exactly right. If you want to repair your relationship and not damage further, you need to stop offering advice and just enjoy being a Grandma. It isn't up to you to "raise" your grandson; that is the parents' job. Follow their rules or your grandson won't be allowed alone with you. Your imagined scenario is getting the way of happy times.
I 1000% agree with this. They are their kids first and your grandchildren second. You will forever damage your relationship with your son, daughter-in-law and grandchild if you do not take to heart everything that was written here. It's very hard to hear but it's the unforgiving truth. 
As a working mom I want to second this comment. Working moms aren't any more "at fault" than working dads. Everyone is doing the best they can. 
I am dangerously lonely, I live in almost complete isolation. I've tried for the past 2 yrs to connect with people and not been successful. I am originally from Texas but lived here for a number of years. I took early retirement due to illness and this basically completed the isolation. My career has ended and I have no family and 1 friend. I am in my 50's and it seems most places, groups etc are for younger people. PLEASE can anyone HELP !!!
 I suggest you join a gym or look around for something that interests you. 
I'm sorry. It can be hard to meet new people. I would say to get out to events you enjoy and try to talk to people. Even so, I know it is hard. 
Are you looking for ways to meet people IRL where you live?

If so, I would check your local park district, your local library, museum/botanical garden, and your local continuing education/adult education service (the latter is often through the county rather than the city). 

All of these should have events/free or low cost classes/activities for people of all ages (and in my experience a lot of them skew toward older people/retirees). The parks might have things like weekly fitness walks, birdwatching, astronomy nights, nature hikes, etc. The others might have things like cooking classes, book club, beekeeping classes, web design, volunteering/mentoring opportunities, dance classes, fun painting or photography classes, you name it. Sometimes you can sign up for bus trips to another city's museum or a musical or a different park, which is a good way to get thrown together quickly with people. Overall this stuff is a good way to find a hobby you like and the classes are often taught by people from the local club for that activity. And like I said, a lot of them are specifically targeted at older adults/retirees! Check it out.

Let me know if you need more ideas or want to talk.
I don't understand the language, IRL? GSDs? I live in Atlanta but from Austin. I am desperately lonely!

Yes I want to talk but I can't figure out how to use this site. I am desperately lonely
Honestly, I cannot take this any longer. I will try to keep this short, so I will not go into specifics.

I am 15, a freshman in HS with a 3.8 GPA. My stepdad is a teacher there. He moved into my life 2 yrs ago and was a very nice man. I don't know what happened, but he got worse. He always yells at me over the tiniest of things. And by yelling I mean screaming, insulting and cursing at the top of his lungs. I could do something like say I want to do something or say something that he disagrees with and he would explode on me. Once, I told him that I am tired of him saying the F word and instead of apology or a reflection, he screamed at me and called me a f***er!  A couple years ago, I was homesick because I recently moved states and missed my friends. I was bawling my eyes out and he invited himself into my room and told me that I am pathetic for crying and shot me a nasty glance when i kept crying. He then screamed, "I didn't cry this much when my f***ing grandmother died!" 

To be honest, I cannot live with him. I tried to talk with him about this stuff once but he was defensive and never even apologized. I did not go over everything he has done, there are many more examples. I just don't know what to do at thos point.
Tell your mother, send her via email what you posted here.

If she doesn't step up, you go to a school counselor, or your father.

Get other adults involved.


Seconded!
Thank you for responding. I have notified my mom prior to this and she is not sure because my stepdad is so nice to me around her. I could tell school counselors, but my stepdad teaches at my school and he would get fired. My mother told me that if I got him fired she would cut off my financial aid. So idk, do i tell anyone?
Yes! And also tell them your mother is threatening to withhold support, financial and emotional, because she doesn't want to step up and actually be a parent.

Whatever may happen to your stepfather when this comes out, is not on you, he should have been a normal person and not an abuser.

I know it is all very easy for me to tell you what to do, I am just a person behind a screen over half a world away from you.

Please speak up to everyone who will listen to you and hear you. Counselors, CPS, police, anyone.

Edit: Also reach out to family, tell them what is happening and that your mother is not going to help you. Try maybe to record your stepfather?
Thanks again! I want to move into my biological father's house, but I know my parents well and that they will challenge me to a court battle if I want to move there. I could try to record but I do not have a phone, and the only things I have that can record are a bulky iPad and a 3DS that makes a loud bleep when I snap a photo/video, so it would be really obvious that I am recording so I would probably have no evidence anyways. If I get my stepdad fired by telling someone he will get mad and spread lies about me like he usually does. My dad knows about all this and will step up if my stepfather hits me. I turn 18 in 2.5 years, so even though I hate the situation and want to get out of it, I don't really want to turn it into a bigger mess than it already is. So... maybe wait out those 2.5 years and move to my dad's house?
That is totally up to you.

A court battle might be a lesser of two evils, in options, but that is for you to decide.

Whatever your decision will be, keep in mind that your mental/physical health is most important here.

Whatever consequences there are in regards to the behaviour of your stepfather and your mother towards you, they are not your fault! That is completely on them.

If it were a stranger acting this way toward you, would your mother also accept that? Then why should you have to accept this behaviour from her husband? Because faaaaamily? Nope. not acceptable.

Please talk to your bio father, ask him what the options are and if he would go to court for you should it be needed.
Thank you for responding and sorry for the late response. I have taken this to my bio father and he is completely aware and offers to step in if needed. My stepfather has gotten better at the very least, but still tries to find oportunities to twist words to incriminate me for mistakes and yells at me. He is still an asshole; he talks about me behind my back to his friends and says to them how "unsuccessful" I am going to be. Last week, I took a serving spoon for my dish to my Spanish I party and accidentally left it in the classroom, and he was screaming at me the whole way home for "stealing the spoon" and "throwing it away." He always tries to use my mistakes to cover up for his intentional actions (like intentionally leaving me at school alone for an hour without a word is justified because I was late getting back from art club). Every time I try to tell my mom about it she either changes the subject or hushes me out. She doesn't really care, she just wants to stay out of it, so idk if I should involve her. Though, I do agree that what she's doing is pathetic.
Good to hear your bio-dad is willing to step in when needed.

Have you asked your mom point blank why she doesn't care that her husband is being abusive to her son? If she even cares about you?

Do you feel she cares about you? How do you see your relationship with her being after you turn 18?
I love both of my parents so much. But they are both brutally honest even when I never asked them their opinion and I don't want to know. My mom makes comments about how I'm so flat-chested, and my dad always tells me I have really ugly teeth. I don't want to hear this. Why do they think its ok to say mean things to me? The last time they did this I got so angry and didn't speak to my parents for the rest of the day. They said I was over-reacting, but I feel that's the only way I can show them how serious I am when I say I want them to stop. Am I over-reacting? Is it normal for all parents to say mean things to their offspring? 
No. It isn't okay for parents to say things like that. Being a kid is hard enough. Being honest is one thing. Making someone aelf-conscious is another. That is just plain mean.
That's really tough, I'm sorry you're being treated that way. My mom is the same, she's constantly commenting on my appearance. She will be shocked and horrified and say, "What's on your face?!!" If I have a pimple and then stare at it like a second head. She also talks about my weight, comments on my 'big fat tummy' which doesn't exist (I'm 5'7" and 135 lbs). Oh yeah, and I'm 32 years old! I think some parents see their children as an extension of them and feel that it's okay to say those things because that's the type of stuff they think about themselves, which is sad. I wouldn't worry about being seen as overreacting, set a limit and stay within it. I've told my mom that if she comments on my appearance I will leave or hang up the phone. I've only had to do it a few times and it's happened a lot less frequently. I hope it gets better for you. They're opinions don't matter. 
That's definetly not okay for them to be saying stuff like that. It only makes you doing yourself. My mom called me get when I was eight and now I've developed an eating disorder. I'm really sorry that they say that stuff about you.
No that is not normal parental behavior, at all. 
I couldn't imagine ever commenting negative on my daughter's appearance, unless it was like an ugly outfit or something. But never her actual appearance. 
I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I know it's pretty, but maybe start making comments about something they are self conscious about. Maybe they'll see how awful it feels and stop. 
Have you sat them down and talked to them, and told them how much the things they say - and the way they say them - bother you?  If you don't feel you can do that try writing it to them in a letter.
It is not right, try and talk to them and make them understand how bad that makes you feel. If they keep going and don't respect your feelings then ignore them and avoid talking to them. I know it sounds bad, but you need to think about yourself, and the fact that they are so mean to you it's not right. My mother is the same. She keeps making comments about the way I dress and about my belly, saying that I look fat and that I can't wear tight things. She makes me extremely uncomfortable so I just stopped caring. When she makes comments I just reply "I don't care if you don't like the way I look, I do and that's enough"
*doubt 
*far

Sorry I'm on mobile
Yeah I did. They told me I was over-sensitive and they're only being honest with me so that I can "improve myself". I told them I don't need any improvements. Something just isn't going through their head. 
*fat 
Omg I hate autocorrect
Oh dear!  I'm so terribly sorry to hear that, hon!  It's awful to be faced with such harshness from the very same people who are supposed to build up your confidence, not tear it down.  I'm old enough to have learned, unfortunately, that not all parents *are parents, * if you catch my drift...?  I'm sending you lots of warm, fuzzy, loving vibes, my dear!!
But it made my day, so thank you!   LMAO
LOL
Long story short, I'm an only child. My parents are doctors, who had me when they were a bit older than the average parent (40 and 42).
I'm in college now, not exactly sure what I want to do, but possibly dentistry or pharmacy. Anyway, my parents had a sit down talk with me the other night about me being a trust fund kid, since they're getting older and whatnot. 

Basically they told me 'not leaving you much money, so don't expect to be a lazy bum.' I wasn't planning on doing that thing anyway..... Then they went on to tell me they're leaving me 3 million, with a 2 percent annual payout. That roughly translates to 60k a year. 

WHO THE HELL THINKS 60k A YEAR IS 'BARELY MAKING ENDS MEET?'
(For a single adult)

Sorry, my parents.... just... real first world problems right there.
Lol! At least you recognize that they are leaving youna gift that will help keep you stable. Some people wouldn't realize it. I love hearing that people like you have that safety net because you appreciate it. Best of luck in school!
This made me giggle. Glad you have this net to give you some peace of mind. I'm so happy for you and wish you all the best! 
I just want to send out warm Christmas wishes from me and my family to you and yours. 
Merry Christmas internet stranger friends!
Merry Christmas!
It all started around 3 weeks ago when my parents and I were inside the car listening to current news. My parents (and grandparents) respected Politician A like they legit worshipped him so my sister and I grew up listening to good stories of this politician. However, when I grew up, I found out the ruthless things this certain politician did, it was all over books and research articles (both local and foreign) from credible sources as well. So I began to have an entirely different political view from the rest of my family. But this was not really a problem as I tend to just be quiet and not jump in whenever they talk about politics because I didn’t want any disagreement to arise within the family. 

However, that day, I found everything that my parents were saying to be too much. They were laughing at how countrymen were killed during the dictatorship of Politician A, and how Politician A did so much to the country and such. I was so disgusted with all they were saying, they were basically advocating crime just because we were in a pretty higher class, and they were supporting a politician who killed millions of people and didn’t even have the audacity to say sorry for any of it. 

So I had too much of it. I talked to them about it, even showing some sources and facts along the way. But my parents were not even listening, they kept on asking me with baseless and repetitive questions like, “You weren’t even born at that time, who are you to talk about that?”, or “Why would I listen to you? I’m the parent here, you listen to me”. In the end, I lost because I was outnumbered in the discussion. I even ended up crying out of frustration. 

Ever since then, my parents have called me names and laughing at my political views and beliefs. They think it’s funny but I feel so disappointed with everything. They even turn on the television really loud whenever news about that certain politician come out and talk with my sister asking her opinion on it (which they like because she has the same political view as them), even when I’m right in front of them.

I’m so disappointed with them so I’ve been locking myself in my room and not talking to them and using my earphones whenever we go out to avoid hearing their opinions and teasing. I sometimes feel guilty of feeling this way because I’ve always loved my parents, we have always been really close. I’ve also thought of just letting go of my own political views just so we could go back to the relationship we had again. But when I think about how they don’t even listen to what I’m saying and how they don’t even try to avoid the topic so we don’t get into a fight, it just feels unfair to me. Why should I be the only one to adjust in this situation? Why would they let this politician affect our relationship so much? 

So yeah, thank you for listening. I just wanted an avenue to rant everything I’ve been feeling these past few weeks. Every night I’ve been crying while thinking about how our relationship has been. And to be honest I’ve never been this depressed in my entire life. And please don’t hesitate to give me comments/advice on how I could go from here on. Thank you.
start listening to punk rock, not on headphones.  

if they object, say "F*CK YOU OLD MAN"
Well, who isn't disappointed with their parents?

First, I can sympathize with your inability to tolerate their acceptance of mass slaughter.  I think your mistake was to enter into dialogue with them in the (vain) attempt at changing their minds.

What would have been better (and surely safer) was for you to talk about your own emotional reaction to their comments, rather than the actual comments themselves.    It's much more difficult for people to dismiss someone's personal reaction/feelings than it is for them to dismiss their actual opinions, even in your case, where your opinions seem factually (and morally) grounded in reality.

If all that sounds reasonable, then you might realize that you and they are entitled (and in this case, thankfully entitled) to have different beliefs, opinions or ideas, and that it's best to stay away from any direct confrontation (or even conversation) that is inflammatory.  Then you might talk with them, as I have suggested... not so  much about the obnoxiousness of their beliefs, but rather your reaction to them.,,that it hurt your feelings, and "You probably weren't aware of that".

In much the same way that you are offended by their opinions and their response to the talk you (attempted) to have, it seems like they are as well.  Try to get the toothpaste back in the tube here, and remember not to squeeze it again.

It happens a lot with families. My dad and his mom are complete opposites. I am not like my parents. Sometimes we talk and when we do we fight. We are better off not talking about it.
You're their legacy. When they die, so do their shitty ideas. Their efforts to taunt you are because they are afraid of that fact. Know that and treat them with love while they are here.
I am a Senior high school girl with a twin brother in my grade. Ever since we were little, he was fascinated with math, and is approximately two years ahead of the rest of my class.

In addition to that, he has good testing skills and a good memory. Because of this, he surpasses me in every class. He has a 92 average in all AP courses and completed all the regents math courses as a junior. He tested into the top 10% in a math competition, (1 in 10? So what?) But few kids took it with him, so he got a "special award" for his math at the school awards because only he got into the top 10%. He gets a lot of academic awards. In addition, he got a lot of prizes in Science Olympiad. He originally got a 1340 on his SATs but took it again. It was superscored to a 1470.

In addition, he played varsity soccer, did track, sings well, always got good roles in drama club, and had his own role in the musical. He has social anxiety but he is kind of the nerd friend and lots of people like him.

He wants to go to Carnegie Mellon and he might get in if he applies early decision.

Me? I'm pathetic. My average is 84 with one AP class whose test I got a 2 on, (I hated that teacher). I have Asperger's and no friends, no one likes me, I had a mental breakdown in 8th grade and so I missed the "track" for AP STEM classes. For two years I was in places (geographically) where I couldn't do extracurriculars or AP or honors. I worked hard to come back but I missed a lot.

 Because I liked to read when I was a kid, people say I'm an English prodigy, but I'm not. I don't read anymore, my English grades are average, and my SAT essay was a 12 out of 24. My counselor always brings up my apparent literary supergenius, asking if my brother is as good. He gets better grades than me in my regents English class in his AP one, and always got better essay grades than me, and got an 18 out of 24 on his SAT essay.

I tried doing Science Olympiad. I lost all the information I needed for my test with my binder, and neither of my partners had studied literally at all. I won nothing. He won two top ten medals with his partners and they had been prepared.

I never played sports due to social anxiety and have no talents. I know I struggle with more mental health problems, fatigue, and anxiety than my brother. In conversation over intellectual topics we are equal, but I have no skills of my own.

I feel like he is a pancake and I am the little droplet you get on the side and wash off. I suck and I think often it would be better if I didn't try to dignify myself by living. The only kind of good thing I have done is get 1320 on my first SAT, which I could not superscore because I scored lower in both sections the second time, with a large disparity between all my SAT/PSAT scores... I might have that problem due to testing difficulties.
Stop comparing yourself to your brother. You are not him and he is not you. Life isn't a competition. You need to the best you can do. Don't worry about anything else.
If it helps at all, my daughter says the AP classes were easier than the regular. It was that way when I grew up. She really thought she would have easy grades in regular classes over AP. Nope. In fact, they graded hard and the weighting for the GPA was lower. She never took regular classes again. Once she decided that, her GPA went up. So don't be fooled by the schools claims that regular classes are so much easier than AP. Literally, in AP Chem, the teacher gave automatic 100's for every test and spare assignment if you just turned it in. It did not matter if it was all wrong. The only grades that counted were tests.

Stop comparing yourself. I wonder where that binder went. And how are your parents about this? I hope they are not part of why you feel this way. Find your own niche. You sound like a great person. And Carnegie Mellon is not everything.
I got a 1320 on my SAT, I thought it was a decent score.    Average is 1,000.
There is so much more to personal worth than a bunch of test scores in high school.
Usually things completely switch around to the opposite after highschool.  Its not unusual for someone who was really popular and was homecoming king to be an alcoholic barely getting by on minimum wage and for the nerdy ugly one whi nobody paid attention to to become owner of their company and become hot.  I've seen it happen multiple times now.  Also, after highschool nobody talks about any of that stuff.  The only time an sat score or ap class will be mentioned is on a college application.  Thats the last time anybody will care.  Youre first employer won't even care.  I haven't been asked about sat scores or ap classes in years and years!!!!  This stuff may matter to you now but college is a whole other beast.  Your brother could really struggle with it and party too much and get himself in trouble while you end up finding a major you're really passionate about and are really good at.  Trust me in 5 years none of those achievements of your brother's will anybody mention or care about.  You will go to a good college and fall in love with the career of your dreams.  No joke.  And you and your brother will end up moving to different states from eachother and will only see eachother on family holidays.






1. Go watch the movie "Twins" starring the governator and Danny Devito. (good for a laugh based on your situation)

2. All of the stuff you are talking about: AP Classes, SAT, HS Sports... you're not really ever going to talk about them again after High School. They are just things you do in High School. When you go to college or enter the workforce, no one is going to ask about your AP curriculum or what you got on your SAT. These things seem big to you NOW, but they won't later.

3. Can your brother lift more than The Rock? Is he the top academic in the US? Does he have more followers on IG/Twitter than the Kardashians?  No.  Because he is a different person. 

You are not your brother. If you want to measure yourself, measure yourself against your past self. Are you improving yourself? Are you happy with what you can do or do you want to do better? Focus on that. You will ALWAYS find people better than you at anything, but if you can look at yourself and say "I'm a little better than yesterday/last week/month/year.", that is really saying something.


You have no talents you say. Talent comes in two forms: natural, developed. Some people are born with genetic predispositions to do well at certain things. Some people work really hard for their talent. It's the whole Superman/Batman dynamic. One of the superheros was just given his abilities, the other one made his own. If you want a talent, go out and make one.

4. Wait until your brother falls asleep and right "SPARE" on the back of his leg or something, when he wakes up let him know you are the better twin. When he asks why, point out he is the spare parts for you. :)

Okay, so I'm a 19 y.o. female, and I live 3 hours away from my mom. My mom has been a widow since I was 5, and never really dated anyone since - except for now. She's now dating some guy named Billy.

So first, let me explain Billy. He's a website designer, but is essentially unemployed because he rarely ever does any work. He lives in a small apartment, drives 2+ hours away almost every day to see his "friend" (female), he ALWAYS mooches off of my mom (ie: she always buys dinner EVERY night for him, pays for drinks for them, etc.), he's just using her for money, oh - and he's also a compulsive liar on pretty major things (ie: told my mom he has been married before, told me he has never been married). And to top all that off he is the single most disrespectful person I have ever had the indecency of encountering, and everyone thinks that way. Her roommate (she rents out a room in her house) thinks so, I think so, her friends think so, my fiancee thinks so. We've even all had a sit-down with her to express our concern for him and how he treats not only her but everyone else.

Anyways, a few days ago I was over at her house, as I was going to spend the weekend with her and watch The Walking Dead this Sunday (which is a tradition ever since the show started). Within the past few months, she's started smoking more (about 4-5 packs of cigarettes a day), and she's drinking as much as a severe alcoholic (to where she's so drunk she's falling over, unable to drive, unable to form words, etc.). 

The night I arrived down there, she was already "asleep" (probably passed out from all the alcohol), so I went into her room to see if I could wake her to let her know I had arrived. There I saw her phone on the floor, lit up. I went over and looked, wondering why it was lit up, and there was a text from Billy. He was expressing how mad he was that he wasn't able to spend the night that night because I was going to be there (I refuse to spend the night in the same house as him - he is a VERY creepy person to say the least). Well, from there I unlocked her phone and read through a few more messages from him. Initially it was to see how many other things he was saying to her that were rude and uncalled for, but my curiosity peaked once I saw my name in the messages and I read about 2 weeks worth.

From there, I realized how much shit she had been talking about me. Yes, I know it's wrong to snoop, and I am not justifying myself in any manner. She had been saying countless things to Billy about me, and he was saying countless things back. Such as, how I am completely "self centered and selfish" and how she doesn't want me to come down and visit as often as I do (I come down a lot because my fiancee's family lives in the same area, as does my grandpa whose time is becoming slim). She also says that I am entitled and thinks that I take things from her home and how she needs to lock her bedroom door (which, I have NEVER stolen ANYTHING from her. I can guarantee its her boyfriend). She also says how disrespectful I am to everyone all the time, which I think is coming from Billy because he was completely egging her on. Also how she's been lying to me. Also they were saying bad things about my fiancee and grandpa, because I spend so much time with him. 

I then looked through a few messages from her and my sister (21yo, lives in Colorado for college). They both had been saying bad things about me as well. My sister was saying how she doesn't want to see me when she comes to California to visit this Christmas, and how my mom shouldn't listen to the concerns I express about Billy and her drinking/smoking because "what do I know."

Needless to say I was beyond furious. I never had the best relationship with my mom growing up but after I moved out I made a huge effort to try and rekindle it. This was a total slap in the face. I put myself up in a hotel for the night, spent the next day with my fiancee's family (we all get along wonderfully), and went home.

What do I do? Am I supposed to tell my mom I saw what she was saying about me? She's wondering why I left, and is pretty upset I did. I don't want to tell her it's because I snooped, but I also don't really want to talk to her much.

Please help! Thanks
Welcome to a bonus of adult hood. Go on with your life and leave these people alone and at arms length at all times. This is toxicity and you cannot fix it.
You should check out /r/raisedbynarcissists 
I have tried to contact my biological dad throughout the years, with no luck. A few months ago, I found him on facebook, and sent a friend request. I also found out his sister's name, and sent her a pm. SO, on Tuesday 18/10/2016, I got a friend request out of the blue, it was my bio-dad. I had totally given up, and now he's extremely keen on getting to know me. This is... almost too much, but I am intriguerd/excited!
I pray he doesn't break your hopes or heart. Take one day at a time ok. Sending happy & positive vibes your way! Take care & stay safe!
Don't get your expectations too high. Take things slow and see where it goes.
Thank you so much! 
So I asked my girlfriend to marry me, and she said yes. (who has a daughter from a previous relationship) (bio dad bolted when he found out she was pregnant, not on the birth certificate, never seen her, doesn't even know her name or of its a boy or girl)

My girlfriends daughter is MY daughter and I'll be adopting her. I want to dance with her at the wedding when I marry her mom. I just can't find the right song that says something like I may not be your biological father but I am your father or that I love you like my own daughter kind of song. (She's 5 if that matters)

I want to have that moment with her I just can't find the right song.

Can anyone help a guy out?


So to clarify 

Marrying someone whose been a single mother since I came around, want to dance with her daughter whose 5. Need song help 
Here's a good song that is both upbeat and relevant to your situation. If you listen to the lyrics, it's about a guy whose gone through so much and finally found the one that he loves (aka your wife) and how he will never turn around and leave her in any circumstances (contrary to your wife's ex). 

The song makes vows throughout such as how the man will promise to his wife that he will stick with her through thick and thin and never leave her, how he will never lie to her or hurt her (emotionally or physically). It's a really sweet song that I'm sure will make a great dance song but also have meaning to your devotion to your wife and your commitment to her unlike her ex.

[Here's the song by the way.](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
Congratulations!! That is so awesome. No songs come to mind, but you will find the right one. I have no doubt you guys will have an awesome dance.
That is a fantastic song.  I wasn't expecting it, I feel kind of tricked.  but I guess I shouldn't have, because it is a very fitting song. 
I found a letter my MIL wrote to my (now ex) husband back when I was a newlywed, tender age of 21.  The line that always stands out to me was, "Is your new wife still all play and no work?" The reason why this STILL pisses me off, even though I divorced him less than 2.5 years after marrying him, is that at the time I was a full time college student.  I do not recall leading anyone to believe that my life's purpose was to be a professional student. This, from a woman whose entire family was a bunch of dropouts who skipped school annually when hunting season started. Not a one of them had a college degree.  By the way, I earned that degree, even after I let her stupid letter guilt me into finding a job that interfered with my studies, but probably made her happy AF. Wish I'd had the balls then that I do now so I could tell her off. Sorry for wanting to better myself! It's not like we couldn't afford to eat and pay our bills.  Grr!! Mothers in law....
I understand. My mother in law hates my guts. My husband finally sees the shit she tries to start. Don't give her that kind of power.
There's really only one way to look at this: people like that don't care about how it effected you. She's not losing sleep about it nor did she even take a split second to think about it after she wrote it down. And confronting her would have done nothing but strengthen her beliefs about you. By thinking about it, you're just keeping it alive and it's hurting you and only you. Just let it go and move on. :)
Education Promise. For every family member I helped get their education they gave me a sworn oath that they must help a less fortunate family member get their education. I now have 3 college grads with no loans paying it forward.  I thought it was a great idea years ago and today at 52 I can now see it was.😊
Hello. I'm writing this here because I wasn't sure where else to put it, since I've abandoned all social media to my benefit. This is a story I feel must be shared in some way. It's long, so don't say I didn't warn you.

My grandmother's (96) time is running short. She's been a tough old bird all of her life, bouncing right back from a broken hip and back injury in her early 90's. She's always loved at home and never stopped driving or working in the yard. Most importantly of all, she has always been the most loving and caring figure in my life (male, 23). A couple days ago, she was put in the hospital for pneumonia, which eventually led to congestive heart failure and being put into ICU today. She is currently stable, but I have the most terrible feeling that she doesn't have long left. 

Our family has been extraordinarily blessed to have had this lady in our lives for such a long time. My two favorite parts about growing up at her house were her cooking (I've been all over this country and have never tasted food better than hers) and her stories. I'll tell you one of them.

She grew up in a small farming community in northern Louisiana during the 1920's and 30's, the daughter of a cotton farmer during the Great Depression. Growing up, she was very timid, but when WWII broke out she became a supervisor at a munitions facility which produced mortar rounds. This job taught her to be assertive and outspoken in whatever she was doing, and very responsible. In one particular instance, she stopped the entire assembly line and outward-bound munitions train to track down a single faulty shell which had no primer and thus would not function. My grandmother told her boss "I've got two brothers in that war, and that very shell could save their lives or someone else's."

She would meet my grandfather, a Navy Corpsman, at a postwar homecoming party for him and his brothers. Love at first sight. I never met him though, as he passed away in 1960. Having no other choice, my grandmother, mother, and uncle moved to town to pick up the pieces. Once they were grown and gone, grandma moved back to where she and my grandfather lived, where she has remained to this day.

She has had many grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and most recently a great-great-grandson, but I am probably the closest to her in my family. I understand that she has lived as full and happy a life as any of us could ever hope for, and reached an age that I certainly won't achieve, but I really do hate to see her leave us. I like to think I've somehow helped her memory remain sharp and her mind good through her later years, being a captive audience to all her wonderful stories. But maybe she's just tough. Hers is truly the Greatest Generation, and none before or since has measured up in my eyes. I've written down stories that she's told me over the years, and plan to write a novel with them one day in tribute.

I don't want to give up hope that she will bounce back and cheat death yet again, though. If any of you are of the praying type, please keep my grandmother in mind. I would greatly appreciate it. If not, then a kind thought or good vibe works just as well in my experience. 

Thanks for your time in reading this post, and good night.
I will definitely pray for your grandmother and your family. What a beautiful written, wonder account of your grandmother. You obviously love her very much and I sure she love you too. She has lived a long and interesting life. It will still be hard when her time does come to leave you all because you love her so much. Opportunitistic infections, like pneumonia, are very hard to come through, but you never know. No matter what happens, it is so great that you have such an awesome matriarch to your family. It is awesome that you have been recording her stories. So many people wish they had after it is too late.

This kind of post is absolutely welcome here. It is so nice to read such a wonderful tribute. I truly hope she is able to recover and if she can't that she doesn't suffer. I can't imagine anything better than being so loved. If you ever want to share the stories that she shared with you or need to talk (I know it is hard to see loves ones like that) I am here any time.
Hey guys, just a follow up update.

Well today we took her to a water park. Had a blast, but something interesting happened. This is relevant to the story but I'm white and my girlfriends daughter is half black. 

She was playing by the water and I was just sitting in a chair watching, I was worn out and just spent awhile going on slides with her.

So she's playing in like ankle deep water and a life guard comes up to her and asks if she's lost, which okay no big deal. So I get up and say she's with me it's okay I'm watching her, and like I said I'm not mad or didn't take it personally. He said Oh okay I'm sorry blah blah blah and our daughter  (in my last post I mentioned her mother and I are getting married so as far as I'm concerned she is my daughter and my girlfriend feels the same way) said don't worry my daddy is watching me and kinda went by me and held my hand (the hand holding I assume was her trying to feel safe and hide, she's very skittish.

No problems life guard said I'm sorry blah blah and I looked at my daughter and said you know I'm always watching you, you will always be safe with me and mom and she said I know  (my real name).

Like I said before she's a very very cautious little girl so when she called me daddy that's like winning the lottery, I didn't push it any further (she's 5 after all).

So days over I take them home. And we do not live together, financially it would be to tight with me being a full time college student and just a cook at a restaurant.

I call them every night and tell them I love them before bed time even if it was 15 minutes ago, it makes her happy so I do not mind. So we're saying our good night's and she said I'm glad you and mom want to marry each other, and when you marry mom that means you're going to be my dad. I told her I'll always be her Dad, today, tomorrow, and forever. She said I know, but we have to wait till you finish school to marry mom so you can adopt me so I always have a daddy. I told her she will always have a daddy right now, so we say our good night's and that's where we are at right now.

Slowly she's coming out of her she'll for me. Slowly every day.
That is so amazing! Thanks for the update. You are awesome. It can take a lot to earn that kind of love and trust and it is clear you love her.
Why don't I like him? Oh, where do I start?

1. **He doesn't know how to communicate.** At times, he seems to think that I should already know what he's thinking. For example, during his visit in college, he was out at night, and he stopped by McDonalds and asked me what I wanted. I told him that I wanted a full Number 2 meal, and he rudely said, "Um, you better pick something else!" Um, excuse me, but you never set a boundary on what I can get in the first place, and I don't see how it's unreasonable when I've bought you meals from places like Pizza Hut and McDonald's plenty of times. In fact, I do it more often for him than the other way around. Another example (I don't remember this too well) is when he told me some positive news about himself. I didn't know exactly what he was talking about, so I asked for clarification. He got irritated and told me, "Have you not been paying attention?" Again, you never told me about this, and just because you told my mother doesn't mean I was around to hear it. That, and it seems that there's this idea in my family (particularly my mother and brother) that if one family member tells another family member about some news, then everyone knows about it. That's not how communication works. I have another example. Sometimes, when I talk to him, he seems inattentive to what I'm saying. When I check if he's listening, I find that he is, but he doesn't seem to understand that if someone is talking to you, you have to make eye contact.

2. **He keeps picking on me.** All the damn time. Not in the sense of being randomly mean, but in the sense of micromanaging everything I do, especially when we're in public. Why are you sitting like this? Why are you doing that? Put some more bass in your voice! Bitch, no! Leave the fuck alone! I can't change even if I wanted to! I'm so tired of all his nasty glares, scoldings, and "corrections." My mother and sister have even told him to stop doing this, but he simply refuses to. I don't understand why he cares so much about how I look to others when he doesn't even obsess over his own appearance. It's normal to monitor how you look to others but not to that extent. Most people don't even care about how you look or what you do unless it naturally attracts attention. I have social anxiety, and even I understand this. It's just talking to people that's the problem.

3. **He's thoughtless.** Seriously. There are times when he'll make an insensitive comment towards me, and he knows that it's rude. Once, I told him about this, and he said that I was being "too sensitive." I get that being open and assertive doesn't mean that you'll always get what you want, but this happens too often. Once again, he's been told several times to stop, but he simply refuses to do so.

4. **He's offended at the fact that I don't always share how I'm feeling.** Oh, make up your damn mind! Every time I tell you that you're being an ass, you don't relent, and now that I don't share my feelings with someone who doesn't give a flip, you're shocked that I don't?

5. **He never apologizes.** No, really. I can't remember the last time he's ever apologized for being an asshole. Ever. I know that saying "I'm sorry" is not the easiest thing ever, but he doesn't even try.

6. **He's too competitive.** This kind of ties into a few of the points above in that he thinks that I should, in a way, be like him. NO. Remember that episode of George Lopez where George teaches Carmen how to drive but ends up upsetting her because he yells at her? It's exactly like that. Almost every time I play a sport or video game with him, he always chastises me for making a mistake. Being competitive is not a bad thing, and some people actually do respond well to that style of coaching, but the thing with him is that he doesn't realize that it's not fair to hold me to that same standard. I don't screw up intentionally, so I don't see why he feels it's necessary to admonish me every damn time I mess up.

...and you know what annoys me most about all of this? I once told my mother that I don't like my brother. Did she react with concern or worry? No, she acted very negatively, telling me that, "He has helped you with paying for something important, so you should like him!" No, that's not how liking someone works. Helping someone is a basic human trait, especially for family. My mother didn't even hear me out; she just reacted viciously. Not going to her about that ever again.

**TL;DR - He has NO emotional intelligence. None whatsoever. Asshole. I don't even know why I bother with him. Part of me knows that he's an ass, but part of me wants to spend time with him. It's clear that no matter what I do, my brother refuses to change himself. Fine. If I can't change him (and I can't, sadly), then I want nothing to do with him until he changes, and I plan on letting him know that.**

EDIT: To be fair to him, until fairly recently, agreeableness wasn't exactly emphasized in our household (my parents weren't all that great). However, I'm 21, and he's 20, and we've all grown up. There is no excuse for that.

I really thought I was the only one with this problem. My goodness. I wish they'd stop doing that.

I wish you good fortune.
She is really so stupid it gives me a headache. She believes in "fairy people" and tells people I was abducted as a child(and is not joking in any way shape or form) Because of her shitty parenting my brother has turned out to be a using dickhead who goes through family members lending money and not paying them back despite having a job. She lends out money she can't afford then ends up behind on bills. 1 night she went out got really drunk, fell over and then goes round telling everyone a taxi driver ran her over. She had some nasty boil thing on her back and tells people she got shot. Every single time I need to do anything, I find out that she has "misplaced" all of my important documents that she shouldn't even be touching. 
Just a minute ago she let 1 of our cats get into our attic somehow while screeching at me to stop it happening whilst she was in the same room as the cat. The attic door was previously shut and the cat would have had no way of getting up there...
I know plenty of people have it worse but I just can't help think that if I had proper support as a child I wouldn't have to struggle through everything I do. 
On one hand I count my blessings that I haven't turned out so stupid, but at the same time I just think people like this should not be allowed to have children when they aren't going to give them any support and are just detrimental to their lives. 
 Ok.. rant over.
I understand how frustrating it can be when a partent is so eccentric. Try to remember that there is a reason she is this way. Do your best to get to a point where you are out of the house so you can keep dealing with her to a minimum.
It sounds like it's time for you to get out of that home.
She needs professional help. 
I'm not sure if posting a link on this is a bad thing to do, but my brother has been feeling down and he recently drew a cat, so I told him I would upload the video he made to youtube.
Sorry if this isn't what this forum is about but it would be great for his confidence if he was to get a few likes and maybe some kind comments:

It looks much better than any cat I can draw. 
Better than I can do!
A public letter to my mother, Bonnie (aka Amber Adams)
 
Dear Mom,

Christmas is almost here and all I can think is “I can’t believe we’re celebrating another Christmas without Mom.”  I think the last time I actually saw you was Christmas 2011.  I’ve thought a lot about you over the last year, mostly as I rocked & sang to my daughter.  I sometimes hear your voice singing those same songs to me (she loves “Ants Go Marching” just like I did).  I look at her & think how much you would love her, how much you’re missing.  She’s a lot like me, your youngest daughter, your baby.  I cannot believe that I got pregnant, went through 9 months of pregnancy, gave birth & have had a child of my own for over a year now & you weren’t there for any of it.  That’s when I knew you were really gone, when I found out that you knew I was pregnant & didn’t even attempt to reach out to me.  You have no idea (or maybe you do because you too had your children without your mother around) how much this experience has made me miss you, ache for my own mother now more than ever before.  But you chose a different life, you chose Rising Life (as you now call yourselves) over your family.  You recently wrote a blog including your “story of stepping onto the personal ascension path”.  Well, this is my chance to tell my story of what it was like for me when you stepped onto that path.  Since we have limited ways of communicating with you this was the only way I could think of to make sure you couldn’t ignore me, to make this letter to you public & post it everywhere I can think of, to tell my side of this very painful & private (& somewhat embarrassing) story.  I cannot speak for anyone else.  I don’t know the loved ones of the other people on your team so I make no assumptions about the group or anyone else who is a part of it…this is about you and your family.

In 2011 it seemed to us that you started to really drift away (according to your blog, that’s the year you physically connected with “quan yin”).  I was planning a wedding & wondering if my own mother was going to make it.  I was so scared for you & our family that I started doing some research, trying to find other people out there who may have family members involved in the same group that you were involved in.  I reached out on a new age cult website , anonymously, because I didn’t know where else to turn & that’s just how afraid I was for you & our family.  And as it turned out, there were people out there who had bad experiences with the same group.  Well, I guess I didn’t count on this group patrolling the internet for anything with their name in it because I was found out (I guess I wasn’t being as anonymous as I thought).  This was the beginning of the end for me.  This is when I was asked with a threat, albeit vague, of legal action to remove my posts.  I guess something along the lines of “quan yin would hate for you to get dragged into any legal action” isn’t exactly a direct threat but a threat nonetheless.  A day or so later a new message was posted on that anonymous forum from “quan yin” publicly providing my name & state of residence.  When I received that same message in my personal email inbox (therefore confirming that he had somehow gotten a hold of my private email address) and you also supported him on the entire issue I knew that was it.  How could I continue a relationship with someone who, as my mother, was supposed to do all she could to protect me but instead blindly followed someone who threatened her daughter & publicly provided her private information for the world to see?  I could no longer allow you to be in my life as long as you continued to be a part of that group because it was too painful & too dangerous.  I wrote you the last email that I ever sent to you begging you to please seek professional help & telling you that as long as you were affiliated with that group I would consider any more communications from you or them harassment.  I never truly thought that you would abide.  You didn’t totally at first but I stayed strong & never replied to any of your attempts to sweep the whole thing under the rug.  Well the ultimatum backfired because I never really thought that it would actually be goodbye forever.  I mean how could I possibly believe that my own mother would actually willingly walk away from me?  And then cut ties with the rest of her family, including her grandchildren?  It didn’t seem like it was really happening.

And now here I am, almost 3 years later with a child of my own wondering what happened, where did my mommy go?  I had an exceptional childhood.  We had wonderful parents who took good care of us.  I had a mother who sang to me every night, did arts & crafts with us, urged me to follow whatever whim I was feeling (piano, violin, soccer, dance, my attempts to save the planet, collect donations for Give A Christmas, etc), who was very involved with my Girl Scouts troop helping sell cookies, going on camping trips, etc.  I look back on my childhood so very fondly & all I can do is thank you because you & dad gave that to me.  And because of that I know the kind of mother that I want to be for my child.  I want to give my child the same wonderful childhood that I had.  However, at the same time, it’s because of you that I know what kind of mother I don’t want to be.  I will never abandon my child, I will never let her feel like she isn’t good enough for me or that she isn’t important enough for me to be in her life.  I will never intentionally leave her when she needs me the most, I will always be there for her no matter what.

You’re repeating the cycle you realize.  It may have happened later in life for us but you abandoned us just like your mother abandoned you.  And as I imagine it was for you, it’s so hard because my mother’s not dead.  I know how that must sound but it’s true.  But at least you knew where your mother was.  Before I found the website, we didn’t even know if you were alive or dead or if we’d ever know if you’d fallen ill or passed away.  But, now we know you’re out there somewhere, choosing a life without us & flaunting it all over the internet.  Not only were we never really given a chance to grieve & move on but we are reminded constantly of your choice via the internet.  I’ve never asked them but I’m sure that must be hard for your older granddaughters.  The ones who are on the internet now & who may someday (if they haven’t already) find you out there living your wonderful life full of “love” & “light” & “happiness” without them.  I can’t imagine what it must have been like for them to have such a wonderful loving & devoted Mom Mom in their lives & having her disappear but knowing she’s still alive.  I know they ask why you won't come back and no matter what we say & the oldest cries for you a lot and wishes you hadn't left her.  Thank god for your sister & your ex-boyfriend who have stepped up to the plate & filled the void that you left for them (and for us quite frankly).

Anyway, I’m not quite sure what I’m trying to accomplish by writing this to you.  Mostly I just need closure & in my own way this is how to get it, no matter what comes out of this.  Stef & I both often have dreams where we are so angrily screaming & yelling at you & you are still as calm as can be, trying to explain ascension & your lifestyle, why it’s so important & how someday it will all be peace & love.  We both say how incredibly frustrated we are in our dreams because we’re expressing our anger with you so loudly & violently & you have absolutely no reaction to it.  I’m sure that indicates how we feel you don’t seem to care about the pain & hurt that you’ve caused us.  But, I think too it’s our subconscious telling us that the anger will never get us anywhere, that there’s absolutely no point in being so angry because it won’t change anything & will only get us more frustrated & upset in the end.  So, my New Year’s resolution is to work on my anger towards you, to move past the pain & forgive you, and this is my first step in doing that.

I guess part of me hopes for a response, part of me hopes you don’t.  Part of me just wants a chance to publicly share my story since you so publicly offer your journey (none of which seems to indicate how incredibly difficult it was to leave your family behind I might add, not sure if that’s because it wasn’t hard for you or because you don’t want people to know the reality of what it might mean to “ascend”).  I’ve been so terrified to share anything publicly because of possible retaliation from your group.  The last time I tried to speak out & find some support for what I was going through I was shut down by the group.  But, if you know me at all you know that I have to share in order to move on.  I know I’d never be able to really heal or relieve some guilt of not trying hard enough unless I had one last ditch effort to communicate with you & plead for you to come home to us.

So I beg of you…please, please, please, come home.  We all miss you.  I want you to know my daughter, to be a part of our lives.  I know you think what you’re doing is “the grandest service to others you could ever undertake” but you’ve been on the verge of ascension for years now & every year it’s the same story…”this is a pivotal year for planetary ascension etc etc etc” & every place that you decide to be is “a pivotal place for the work you’re doing etc etc etc”.  Don’t you see that it’s the same thing over & over again year after year?  Nothing ever changes except for some secret invisible thing that apparently only enlightened people can see.  The only thing that is really truly changing is time.  Time is continuing to pass you by & you’re aging & your children & grandchildren are aging & you’re going to realize one day that it’s too late & you missed all of it.  Just because your children are grown, it doesn't mean we don't need our mother.  Children always need their mother, especially daughters & your grandchildren need their Mom Mom.  I know you think that somehow one day when this ascension happens none of that will matter & all will be love & light & peace on earth but when is that supposed to happen?  And what happens if you ascend but your loved ones never do, we just go through our lives in pain & suffering never having the closure you have gotten for yourself?  I understand, it must seem impossible to come home now but the longer you stay away from us the harder it will be to come back.  It’s only been a few years now.  As hard as it might be for everyone we would figure it out together…it’s not too late for you, for us to be a family again, for you to know my daughter & reconnect with your children, grandchildren & the rest of your family.  I’m begging you to please find that tiny part of you that was a mother first, that loved her children (and grandchildren) more than anything & listen to her.  There’s some part of you deep down inside that knows that I might be right.  I know this is all in vain but I have to try.  I know you think you’re doing something that you always thought you were meant to do, something bigger than yourself.  But being a mother & a grandmother is bigger than yourself.  Sacrificing what you think is for the better of the planet because your family needs you is something that’s bigger than yourself.  That itself is actually “the grandest service to others you could ever undertake”.  I’m your daughter, you know me, there’s not an evil, malicious bone in my body…I just love & miss you so very much & I just want my mommy back.  We love you, we miss you, it hurts…please come home. 

Love,

Stacey
I just wanted to say I am so sorry for all you have been through. I can't begin to imagine the pain this has caused you and your family. You deserve better. I truly wish you and your family all the best and I hope that you get the closure you seek.
Just an update...my mother responded via a Facebook message & told me that she has no plans to return & basically that we should all move on.  Unfortunately it would seem that our mother is gone forever.
Thank you, that's very kind.
We built a garden and the whole family works on it for an hour a day. It is our first one and so far the kids are enjoying it. I don't know how long that lasts but I hope for a while. A side from telling my 7yr old we use hatchets to chop down trees and we don't punch them down, everything has been going good. Today we buy cow manure to till into the dirt and I can't wait to see their faces when I tell them what it is. After they get good and dirty in it of course. Does anyone else garden with their family?
I don't but I want to. It's not warm enough to start outside, but we might try some starts this weekend. Would you share pictures of your garden? We don't have beds yet but are going to build them when the snow melts. 

I am 23 years old, and an only child. I have always lived with my mom, but for the last 8 years I have struggled with mental illness. I was diagnosed as being psychotic 2 years ago. My mom got married a few years ago so I live with my step dad too. I have always only worked part time (20-28 hours a week), and have never been able to save money very well. But for the last year they have charged me $300 a month to live with them because I'm a grown up and its what grown ups do . I didn't get my driver's license until I was 23, and they didn't really even help me get my drivers license. But now that I want to buy my first car its too hard to save enough money when I only work part time and they are taking $3,600 from me a year when I only make $12,000 a year. 
Having and raising a child is not, and should not be a lifetime financial commitment. 

All adults in a house should contribute financially and practically to the household.

Sometimes it is not easy, but that is just part of being an adult.  
> I am 23 years old

Then the answer is yes.
They said it right. You're an adult. I earn half of that and still pay the same amount a year, and I'm 18. If you're living with them and they are providing everything for you, you need to help pay it. It's not the case of "is it right for her to do that", because only she will know that answer. But you're an adult and no matter what you have been through it doesn't change the fact that if you weren't living with her you'd be paying a lot more to live on your own or with a roommate. Why can't you work full time? 

If it bothers you that much just speak to her about it and see what she says 
Our rule for our children is, if you are living at home as a high school graduate and not going to school or some other technical program then yes you need to pay rent and your portion of the car insurance. We have 1 kid who is in school full time but lives at home and has 2 jobs. That one pays for the car insurance, school, and anything extra they want. The other one decided not to go to school but does pay rent, car insurance, their own cell phone bill and their credit card. Anything extra is for them to pay for. We also expect each one to do their chore! I'm not going to say what we charge but it's honestly not much! 
Yes.

These commenters don't understand what it's like to live with mental illness, and how debilitating that can be. It's tough enough to get ahead in this world without illness weighing you down.

Some parents agree to help a sick or disabled child well into adulthood, and understand that it can take longer to accomplish basic things that others take for granted. Some other parents refuse to help at all.

But then there are parents like yours who do the in-between thing, where they'll help you out to an extent, and then hold it over your head. They won't help you improve your life, but they will offer a handout and then take it away, or layer on the guilt, or keep you financially dependent while taking away any earnings that could help you establish your own life. I get it.

You have a clear diagnosis. Is there a way you can work with your doctors/therapists to apply for temporary disability benefits - just to help you get on your feet, supplement your income, and get independent from this co-dependent dynamic you have with your parents? 

In the meantime, please congratulate yourself for all your accomplishments. I live with a chronic disease, and even going to a part time job is a big deal. Pat yourself on the back for persevering and maintaining a job, and for getting your license. These aren't small accomplishments.

And ignore the haters. They live sad, small lives and have nothing better to do to feed their egos.
I guess the better question is, do you plan to live with them for free for the rest of your life? Eventually you have to get your own place and pay bills, that will be much more than what they are charging you now. Maybe it is there way to motivate you to better your situation, find a better job or take classes to improve. I cannot relate to your mental illness so I don't really know how that affects things. I plan to start charging rent to my kids as soon as they are no longer in school.
I understand the low income and the mental health but what is the alternative? I doubt you will find anything cheaper in a better situation. If you can then leave if not you might be able to negotiate something better but if not it will be best to embrace it. 
I don't live at home, but when I was 23 I lived in a place where I paid around $1400 for rent.  Now i'm paying $2100.  Just keep that in mind.  I'd kill for a $300 rent
Yep.  If you don't like it.  Feel free and move out

Your parents should realize the fact that you are working to better yourself, and at least cut you some slack. I know it can be hard to save money but put yourself on a strict budget. Also congrats on getting your license! Better late than never, right? I'm 19, raised by a narcissistic mother and she hasn't paid a dime towards my lessons but she paid for my brother's and even brought him a car. I have my roadtest in a few weeks and I'm hoping I get my license.

Anywho, sorry for getting off topic, I'm just so happy for you. :) Now you need to get a car so just save up, and it may be slow and painful but trust me your money will add up, the more you keep saving. You can do it! Believe in yourself! :) Personally I believe that parents shouldn't charge their children rent until they're 25 but every parent is different. Hang in there, and keep saving! :]

Maybe you can ask them to charge you less?
I feel bad that your parents are charging you rent, and you're only 18 AND working a part time job. :O
This is reasonable. I'm in the same situation as your child who has 2 jobs. I'm going to college, and college is expensive so if my mom were to charge me rent... I would be SOL.
>But then there are parents like yours who do the in-between thing, where they'll help you out to an extent, and then hold it over your head. They won't help you improve your life, but they will offer a handout and then take it away, or layer on the guilt, or keep you financially dependent while taking away any earnings that could help you establish your own life.

Where in OP's post does it suggest any of this is going on?

>They live sad, small lives and have nothing better to do to feed their egos.

Mental illness or not, OP is no longer his parents' responsibility.  $300 rent is nothing plus I suspect that OP doesn't have to pay utilities and probably even gets fed for free.  It sounds like his parents are doing the best they can in a tough situation.  What does this have to do with ego or the state of the "hater's" lives?

I swear, anytime reddit hears "mental illness" it's like the person is beyond reproach.  It certainly makes life harder but it is not a 100% excuse all the time.  
"These commenters don't understand what it's like to live with mental illness, and how debilitating that can be. " Bingo.
Undermining someone's issue doesn't help them. Keep that in mind.
> Your parents should realize the fact that you are working to better yourself, and at least cut you some slack.

$300/month *IS* cutting him some slack. 
I am working a full time job because I'm an apprentice, and my wage is £3.51 an hour, 37 hours a week. It's annoying but there is no point arguing about it
In case you missed it:

>These commenters don't understand what it's like to live with mental illness, and how debilitating that can be.

Until you walk a mile in someone else's shoes...
Fair enough
It depends on how much he gets paid an hour, how many hours he works (are they sporadic), what kind of job is it. Retail is very shitty, and hours can be inconsistent from my experience. Luckily, it's never been that bad but, there are times when companies need to do payroll cuts. Idk... I feel like the OP could give us more info.
In case you missed it:
>It certainly makes life harder but it is not a 100% excuse all the time.

Your reply is ironic considering the many assumptions you make in your initial post.  Many people with mental illness do not have half the support OP is getting yet you demonize his parents without any justification.  OP is certainly in a tough situation but we don't know the whole story.  What we do know is that OP is legally an adult, despite his mental issues, and his parents have no obligation to support him.  OP needs to understand this and, while he may be getting a raw deal from his parents, things could certainly be a lot worse.
Who gives a shit about any of that? $300 per month is cheap as shit. His employment situation is his own concern and no one else's.
I wouldn't know where to start unraveling those fallacies.

Mental illness isn't something that gets pushed aside when it's inconvenient. It's a fact. It exists. It's not a choice. It makes life hard for people. You can't think it out of existence, or write a bunch of nonsense to try and minimize it.

This subject doesn't concern you, it's not something you can relate to, so why are you here tearing down random strangers? What does that say about you?
What fallacies?  The fact that 20 to 25% of the homeless population in the United States suffers from some form of severe mental illness?  The fact that OP's rent at his parents house is a fraction of what he would pay somewhere else for room & board?  Or the fact that you're making some pretty grand assumptions about OP's parents?

Your initial post was based on some dreamed-up situation regarding OP and now you're also dreaming up nonsense with regard to the points I've made in this thread.  

>Mental illness isn't something that gets pushed aside when it's inconvenient. It's a fact. It exists. It's not a choice. It makes life hard for people. You can't think it out of existence, or write a bunch of nonsense to try and minimize it.

Where do I argue against any of this?

I'm not tearing down anyone, you are.  Your post is ignorant and cruel to OP's parents based on unsupported assumptions.  On top of that, your latest post ends with a passive-aggressive attack on my character.  You don't seem to understand what is going on here, yet you attack me, OP's parents and the other posters in here.  Don't be angry at me for pointing out how shitty reality is. 

>What does that say about you?

It says I understand how the world  (regardless of how shitty it may be)  works and respect those with mental illness, while at the same time, I acknowledge that hardship--in any form--does not relieve a person from the obligations of adulthood.  Do people with mental illness have it rough?  Yes.  Does mental illness somehow discharge adult obligations?  No.  OP still has to eat and take care of himself because he's an adult and nobody is required to take care of him.  Is that not true?

I don't make these rules but OP should be aware of them and it does him no good if you ignorantly point the finger at his parents, who appear to be doing the best they can.  What they're doing may not be good enough for you but "until you walk a mile in someone else's shoes..."  Right?

What does it say about you when you attack strangers as "haters" living sad, small lives and have nothing better to do to feed their egos?  Do you know these people?  Clearly you do not understand their motivation or what they are trying to say regarding OP.   You appear to have serious anger and reading comprehension issues.
>What fallacies?

The fallacy that mentally ill people can function, apparently.
Check your ego dude.
You really do not seem to understand some pretty basic things. 
You must love to hear yourself talk.
Help, my father is a horrible, evil man. He threatened to beat me until I died today. He even said that my mother should have left me to die at birth (the umbilical cord was stuck around my neck and the only way I could make it out alive was through c section.) He said my mother should have just left me to die like that. And he said all this all because I didn't clean the bathroom "properly." Help?
You're right. Your father is an evil bastard that doesn't deserve you. You are a kid and he treats you like that for not cleaning. Don't let him upset you, he clearly is not mentaly stable and has some inner torment and is taking it out on you.

Never take it to heart, you are not bad, you are not evil and you most certainly don't deserve to die. You need to tell an adult that he threatened you, someone you trust;your mother, a teacher, a family friend but you need to tell someone. If he Ever lays a hand on you report him send the evil bastard to rot. You deserve better than him. If you ever need to talk to anyone dont hesitate to message me.
If you are in danger you need to get somewhere safe. If you are under age it is time to talk to a teacher or guidance counselor or call CPS. You need help to get away from thid man.
If it were me, I would have challenged my dad to single combat with katanas on the roof. However, that's just me.

Reach out to someone you can trust, and the authorities as well. Get outta there.
My mother is fully behind him in the abuse. She is even worse. She constantly calls me names, like ugly, wicked, evil, she says she hopes I grow up to be poor, says I'm an embarrassment, and that she hates me. 
I'm scared to talk to anyone about the abuse. I have younger siblings. 
Call child protective services ASAP
Like I said before you don't deserve any of this, You are not the problem they are. You need to get out of that home, if you have a friend you can go see talk to their parents and phone CPS or the police. It's a scary thought but this needs to happen before they hurt you, your siblings can't do this, you need to. You are not any of the things they say you are, they are calling you evil yet you don't want to ruin the public image of your abusive father, you need to.

Please help your siblings, phone CPS and tell them everything, they will help you more than we can and they will look after you and your siblings. Please report them, no one can help you unless you tell them. Best of luck keep us updated.
That's a reason you should tell. You all neee help. 
But I can't ruin his image. He's a pastor
He is the one ruining his image. He is to blame, not you. Thr safety of you and your siblings comes first.  A real man of God doesn't hide behind the cloth.
I take great pride in being a single father.  Everytime I sit down to eat with one or both of my sons to eat, I always think about how damn lucky I am to give these boys what I never had.  And also I think about the millions of people who will never experience a plate of food like the one I sit down to almost everyday.  I have never been as fullfilled as I am today.
Fiance and I are splitting up... We agreed I would have our 4 yr old daughter in the mornings until afternoon when I work, shared parenting and all that. Last night was the last night with my family.

I'm scared of whether she will maintain the deal due to how harshly she can react. I hope it works out, I just want my rime with my child, considering the fiance has shown she never wanted to be a parent in the first place.

Im
That is awesome! I have the utmost respect for single parents. My husband has been on a business trip and I definitely miss having another parent in the house! Keep up the great work!
Get a formal custody agreement. Don't give her a chance to go back on it. Keep records of agreements. It sounds petty, but it isn't. 
You might think this sounds crazy but it is crazy to me just as well. I NEVER wanted children growing up and I always wanted to make sure I was married and finished with college as well as have a stable career before hand. Right now, I have NONE of that and I would be stupid to have a child under such poor conditions that I am living in right now. I want a baby simply because...I want to feel like I am in a family.....
My stepdad has made it so I have no relationship with my mom and siblings and I feel uncomfortable and unwanted and of course isolated in my own house. I live here still because it's more convenient since my college is around the corner but I am moving out in August. 
Anyway, I want to find a man to settle down with and have a baby with just to be a part of a loving family. I don't feel I was born into one so I feel the need to create my own. I understand I do not want to bring a child into this world at this low point in my life so I am not, I just have extreme baby fever and think about it all the time.

Do I sound crazy for thinking this way? And are any of you out there very young parents? 
You shouldn't have a baby because you want someone to love you. Having a baby isn't going to give you the family you are longing for. You don't all of a sudden get a happy family because of a baby. If you aren't stable first and in a good relationship, it is going to be a stressful obligation.  You will bw exhausted and overworked. You won't be spending much time with youd child because you will have to work to support you both. Your family could kick you out. You may or may not have the support of the father. You may not finish school and that could mean working a nimum wage job with little hope of advancement. You don't want to resent your child when the dream doesn't live up to the reality. You sound depressed. Get help for that. Make your own family by surrounding yourself with people who are supportive. Friends can be family.
Hello! Young parent here. I had my daughter when I was 18, pregnant at 17. I'm now 20 and married to her father. 

It's NOT easy. I know everyone says that- but please believe them. I love my kid to death, but having her definitely took away a lot of my young adult years, such as going to college for a bachelors degree (did do some college, still in it!) or even going to prom. But I wouldn't change it for anything. Just please- wait to settle down and don't rush into it. Babies and kids are wonderful, but they shouldn't be there to fill a void. 

I'm sorry to hear about your situation with your family. Do you have a therapist or counselor you can talk to about this? As cheesy as it is, learn to love yourself. Invest in things you like, and hobbies, and see what you are passionate about. You could use your experience in life to help others, maybe in education or a career in psychology. Use the baby fever and wanting a family as motivation to get through college, find a good job, and the right person to settle down with. Everything will come in due time- just be patient. 

Edit: if you have any questions about being a young parent or anything please feel free to ask!
A baby won't fix those feelings.

In fact, a baby can be one of the most isolating things in the entire world.

Your original plan is the best plan. Do that with the driving goal of making the most comfortable, happy life for yourself and your future little(s), where you could afford to say "fuck off" to anyone who wants to impinge on your peace.

Your goal should be to raise a child independently if it came down to it, because so many of us find partway through at some point that this one oversight hobbles potential for us and our child(ren). To do that, you're going to need your own skills that translate across more than one industry and won't be declining as automation becomes more prevalent but also gives you control over your schedule after a few years of establishing yourself. That way, you can take the time to have a baby, enjoy their new existence and get yourselves through that 1st year or so in comfort, then return to the workforce knowing you could afford to put them in a safe, happy place while you work just enough to keep your career on target and give them the most nurturing start.

I'm glad to see that you recognize where your extreme feelings are coming from and know they're not a good idea. Don't let them trick you into doing this the wrong way - triple down on protection if you end up in a relationship; heck, avoid relationships while you get yourself onto the right path.

You and the family you will create will be grateful, pleased, and relieved that you did, and you will enjoy life so much more.

Peace to you, OP.
My mother had me when she was 17. My little sister had her first daughter when she was 18. Her first (my niece) just had HER first child at 20. One thing I have noticed is that both my sister and my mother have been too absorbed with their own need for love to be good, loving parents to their own children. Each daughter in turn continued the cycle, hoping to find in her own child what she never received from her mother. 

(I am not sure how I avoided the teen pregnancy path. At 40, I am still dealing with the fallout of having a parent who was not emotionally prepared to handle anything but her own wants and needs.)

I cannot say anything to help your present state. I remember that seeing beyond the present was almost impossible at 20 (Hell, it hasn't gotten that much easier now.) I can only say that you are young, and if you take care of yourself, your life can get SOOOOOOOO much better. You're on your way to college. You have such a great opportunity to create an amazing story for yourself. Learn to love yourself. Find friends who love you. (They will!! It's so amazing. Be kind and be you and people will like you for you.) Find a therapist if you need to. 

Take all of the love you want to give a baby and give it to yourself right now. Have a baby when you're ready to give instead of in a place of needing to receive. Please. You will be happier and your future children will be happier. 


Does your family not respect your views? I am working on a documentary series about politics and culture war issues splitting up family members.
The documentary aims to help.
I have a hard time talking to my family about politics. Inget very upset when they regurgitate Fox news lies. I avoid the subject because I can't stand talking to them about it.
My wife has had a hard time talking to her mother, probably like twice since the election. 
So I'm just an average high school guy who happens to be in IB, which is a lot of work. It's come to the point where I get so much homework that I have to stay up a bit later to finish it (1 or 2 am). I start when I get home btw. My parents however, constantly think that I do not have much homework although I am busting my ass trying to do well. They say how I don't have my priorites, am not focused, stuff like that. I am just wondering, what do I do? I try to explain that I really have homework and show them, but they think that I'm just playing video games or something and then doing my homework last minute. What do I do?
Show them your homework. I suggest showing them completed assignments. IB is a lot of work, but it is concerning that you are expected to do that much. It isn't your fault.
Maybe you can suggest they try doing your homework for one night, in that one night?  They can even do it together and see how much they get done, and in what time frame.  If it turns out that they can bash out your homework in two hours and still have time for video games maybe you should rethink the whole busting your ass thing?  Chances are they won't, however, but it might remind them of when they were in school, and what a "breeze" homework really was...?

Just a suggestion.  I won't be hurt if you don't take it. LOL
The thing is, I show them my homework but they just say "That isn't even a lot. You should already be done."
Maybe have the teacher talk to them.
My mom inherited an ancient palace from an old rich/noble aunt 7/8 years ago. We live in Northern Italy the palace is in the extreme southern Italy (12 hours by car) so we never even go there. My mom first years did not want to sell because it was "too early" and looked bad to sell just after her death. So we waited hoping that things would change. My father wants to sell it too and he quarrelled with her about that many times. They even pay high taxes for the house and part of that money is my father's of course. My mother now says that she wants to sell in theory but she has not even taken away the personal objects and clothes of the dead aunt. I proposed to do it myself and she let me, I threw everything in bags hoping she would go there to pick them up or charge someone to do it but she did not. She works and she never finds time to do a travel there. She says that she wants to be there to do anything and she does not trust anyone, even if she already pays a monthly wage (200 euro which here is 1/6 of a common wage) to a trusted woman there to do nothing rather than "keep the house well". I am sure she wants to sell but I have to fight against this way of thinking which is absurd. She simply has to put away the bags, put a lock in 2 doors to divide the house in 3 parts and rent them separately in the meanwhile she finds someone to sell the house (maybe she will never find) but she says she has to be there to do that. 3 years have passed to put a lock ... I don't even understand if she really wants that or its just an excuse. She has an old mother and spends all holidays there so there will never be time to go to the palace. 
Also in a part of the house there is a woman who rented that side and she should leave to sell the house while she did not send her away. 
My mom is an extremely polite person I understand and finds bad to send away someone, but this is way too much. 
I know it is not my business but I am aware that having a house whose value is over 600 000 euro sold would make a big difference for us, who are a normal family (they are both employees and I'm a student). So I find absurd that now that we have finally a chance to be rich we don't use it for stupid reasons. 
have you tried asking your mom why exactly she doesn't want to sell the house? maybe she's waiting for the right price or the right buyer? I don't know just a thought. I understand how you feel because I have come across situations like this before. But when I enquire further from my mom she told me it's not as easy as it looks like because genuine buyers are not easy to come by and sometimes the buyer's asking price is below expectation.

I wad very fortunate. My grandfather on my dad's side would have tea parties and play Pretty Pretty Princess with us. My grandfather on my mother's side always took in interest in what my sister and I did and supported us. My poor dad would be the one to stop at Costco and buy feminine products for my sister and I (my mom had a hysterectomy at 30 and worked close to the store). 

Now my husband and I have two girls. One night, while visiting my parents, I heard my dad ask my husband about where he could learn Frozen songs to sing for his granddaughters, who loved the songs. They were singing it together. It melted my heart. I had a baby shower to go to (I ended up being sick at rhe last minute). My husband and dad took the kids to breakfast and bowling along with my 10 month old niece. She also gets the princess treatment.

My sister and I took karate, learned sports, etc. We both love football and have passed that on. My older daughter told me how sad she was that football is over for the season. She is 4. Some dads do great with daughters. My husband is an amazing dad. The girls couldn't adore him more. I am lucky for a dad and grandfathers, who never treated us like we couldn't do things because we are girls.

I understand how you feel (husband is Father of 3 kids) and just made the most overtime list for his very large company for the whole U.S. What the kids  don't realize is he has gotten us completely out of debt and saved thousands of dollars towards buying a new house next year in just the last 18 months.  He hates it but this is a season of push hard then he can cut back when we buy the house.  Be as supportive and encouraging as you can (texts,  little treats he likes) but also remind him you miss him and want to spend time with him.  This approach works much better than trying to convince him to take time off for his own sake. 
My father has been doing this for years, especially after starting his own company years back. i do get it in a way as him supporting us and seeing us happy is what makes him happy but theres a breaking point in which he needs to live life a little and enjoy the little things outside of work. Do not get me wrong, him working hard so i graduate with no student debt and can afford to travel and such is great but there needs to be time where he worries about himself first
This should be the 4th time he got caught, and I don't know how many more times he did this uncaught. Honestly, I couldn't care less. At this point, I have the mindset that fuck it, it's up to him continuing this as long as he provide for my sister and mom. But the problem is his job is not stable, so is his salary. My family is very affected by this especially financially. I feel very sorry for my mom, she work her ass off to provide for us. My mom doesn't know about this, and I don't intend to tell her either. She said she will divorce him if she found out he's having an affair again. Divorcing him would be good idea, however we would be scraping a living. Mom used to own a canteen and from there she helped my dad to buy lands and houses, under my dad's name! But now my dad won't sell them off because they are kinda like a status symbol for him to show off, making my dad more of a prick and at the same time attracting those gold digger hoes at my dad's hometown. I could go on and on about how it's a struggle living with him but that should be another story.

Here's the thing. My dad kinda respect me for who I am especially lately for some reasons. I also rarely got involved in my parents problems. But I told him last time that if he ever cheat on my mom again me and my sister will leave him. He freaked out. Now I'm planning to persuade him to sell of one of his land and his house, then transfer the money to my mom's account. I did that last time to pay for my college and he agreed. I'll just say that the money is to be used to further finance my studies and open up new canteen for my mom. Then we would leave him. Am I being cruel using this approach?
I think you are playing a dangerous game and emotionally blackmailing your dad in order to gain some financial stability. This is going to end badly.
I'm thinking that it's probably better for your mother to see a divorce lawyer. Maybe try a legal subreddit.
That's what I thought too. But looking at our condition right now, we really deserve a bit of financial stability. We have been suffering for years. I don't know what else should I do.
This is not the way. I wish I had answers. It is a rotten situation, but deception and manipulation is only going to make things worse.
ok well not sexually but they do sleep in the same bed. she's 36 ish and he's 14. my mum is also a single mum. I know for a fact that she masturbates while sleeping next to him. like she doesn't moan or anything but literally you can hear her breathing loud and her rubbing or some shit and it's so fucking nasty, even for me who's in the other room.isnt that just so fucking wrong? we do have a spare bed but my brother won't sleep there. and I don't think she intends to make it sexual with my brother but it's just nasty. 
I personally don't think it is healthy for a kid that age to not sleep in his own bed on a regular basis. It is also not okay for your mom to masterbate while he is in there. It sounds like something os going on with your brother. How old are you and how do you know all this? If you are school age, it may be time to talk to a teacher or guidance counselor. If you are over 18 and you think something is really off, call CPS. A lot of places allow you to do so annoyomously.
Because I was born with ADHD, I've been terrible in school up until the 12th grade. However, once I've started smoking, I was able to have a good control over my ADHD, and score top grades and get into a top university. 

My sister had always been the "gold sheep" of the family; getting straight A's throughout school. She's been treated like a precious gem all throughout her life by my worthless parents, while I was physically, emotionally and mentally abused pretty much all of my life with my parents; then they kicked me out of their luxury condo as soon as I was 18. 

Here's the fun part. Quite recently, my dad called me to "check up" on me for the first time since kicking me out. Despite the financial hell I've gone through, I was able to successfully complete my 3rd year with 4.0 cGPA. I've told him that and he starts mumbling about how "proud" he was of me. 

Granted by this point, I wished nothing but death upon my so-called family, but I pretended otherwise and continued to inquire about them. (Not because I give two fucks about those cocksuckers, but only because I knew something was up. I was hoping for good news like my good-for-nothing mom was dead or something.)

Basically, this is why they called me. My dumbass sister whose only achievement in life is to score A's in some kid level schooling up to high school, totally fucked up university while partying and puking to be thin (bulimia). So they called me, hoping that I succeeded, so they can tell all their other rich friends, with their successful kids, that at least one of their kids (me) turned out alright. 

I asked him to wire me some money for school and etc.

Then I called him back cussing him out calling him "trash", "piece of shit", and told him that I have no family while laughing at him and hanging up.

Of course, I cannot share this with anyone I know for the sake of my own standing. I don't want anyone to think I'm a sociopath (Maybe I am? But whatever). All I wanted to do was share the explosive feeling of joy that I feel at this moment.

If there's anything akin to justice in this world, I've had my first share.
I thought I was reading a post on /r/raisedbynarcissists - I suggest you check it out, we're a very welcoming community
They sound like narcisists, but you also sound like you have a lot of trauma. If you don't care about them then you shouldn't talk to them. I understand wanting nothing to do with them, but not wishing death on them. Lots of schools offer some kind of mental health services. You should look into it. It sounds like you have been through hell and it could really help to talk to a professional.
So, this morning started off interesting, had an email from my boss' boss saying that either I or my boss needed to call him asap. My first instinct was we fucked up in something work related, but I called him and he answered and when I told him I had gotten his email and braced for a scolding about work things he said:


"Hey! Rykerwulf, just who I wanted to talk to, so I got an interesting email, saying you're on a missing person report. It was filed by a couple in the state, does that sound like someone you might know?"


"Well, sounds like my mother"

"Do you have a way of contacting her?"

"Yeah, I just don't speak to her, we had a big fight two years ago and she told me never to speak to her again unless I intended to apologize, then a year after that she snapped and beat the crap out of my little sister."

He pauses for a moment, "how old are you?"

"27 sir"

"Alright, this is what I'm gonna do; I'm going to let them know that they'll have to go through HR to get any kind of contact info, and I'm gonna tell HR that you don't want your info disclosed."

So yeah, strange morning to say the least.
It is good that he is going to take some safe guards. You also may want to call the police non emergency line and explain that you discovered their was a miaaing person's report on you and explain the situation. That way. They can close the report.
So may sister (46) is 3 years older than i am.  about a year ago, she calls me crying saying she has no place to go.  without giving it a thought I tell her not to worry, she can come stay with me and my family (we live about 4 hours away).  I tell her to get in her car and just head my way.  She then tells me she has no car, so I say no big deal, I will buy you a train ticket.  She then says that she so has no way to get to the train station, so I call a friend and ask them to pick her up and take her to the train station.  I email her the train tickets and tell her that I have someone that will give her a ride to the station.  Next obsticle, the train wont allow her to bring all of her luggage.(trash bags of clothes, totes and boxes)  Luckily I manage a trucking company so I arrange for my company to get her belonings to the city in which I live and I bring them to my house for her.  She has a history with drugs and alchohol and I have 2 young daughters, so I explain to her that drugs will not be allowed in my house (should be a given) and I would not tollerate her being drunk all of the time.  I wanted her to come and get back on her feet and we would do everything to make her feel like part of our family.  She is very greatful, and thankful for the opportunity.  She arrives and is full of hope and says she will immediately start looking for a job.  Fast forward a couple of weeks and no job and no prospects of finding a job.  She was locked in her room morning noon and night, and we never saw her aside from occasional trips to the kitchen.  I would look at craigslist and the classifieds for job openings and relay what i found on to her.  She said that she was putting in job applications, but didnt know that I knew the HR manager at one of the placed she claimed to have placed an application.  this went on for about a month until I told her that she really needed to get motivated and get out there and find something.  She said that she had worked with a temp company in the past and they had an office in our town as well so she was going to give them a shot.  after turning down several opportunities which were close enough to walk to, she accepted an assignment with a company that is about 15 miles away from the house and decided that was the place that suited her best.  her plan was to take a cab to and from work everyday, and that is exactly what she did.  She made about "$96 per day and spent over half of that on cab fare.  She continued taking the cab to work for a couple of months and then realized that she was getting no where with her finances (she paid us nothing, and we didnt ask for anything.)  She then decided that renting a car would be less expensive, so she quit taking a cab and started renting a car.  this did save her a little bit of money, but she was still not making any progress.  I told her she needed to save and get a little car to get her to and from work....a little cheap car that wouldnt kill her on payments.  I was referring to like a little $1000-$2000 car.  about 5 months into her stay she did go out and buy a car....a BRAND NEW car.  (my wife drives a 2009 and I drive a 2007).  So now we are 5 months in to her stay with us.  We are still not asking for any money, so naturally she still has not paid anything in.  She has also never vacuumed, cleaned the kitchen, taken out the trash, bought groceries, or even cleaned the bathroom that she shares with my 2 daughters.  We still never, or at least rarely see her come out of her room, and we do see her she is complaining about one thing or another, like the internet is down or her cable box isnt working right or the batteries in her tv remote are dying.  About another month goes by and I tell her she has 60 days, and she needs to find a new place.  I explain that would have given her 9 months of free living to get on her feet and find a place that she can afford.  I tell her i am tired of her not making any effort to better herself, I am tired of her not offering to help with the house work, and all in all I am tired of her being lazy.The next month goes by and we see her a little more and she seems to be making more effort to be a part of the household(still doesnt do any cleaning, but at least comes out of her room and speaks).  at the end of that month, she asks if she can have an extra month because she still hasnt saved enough money to get her car registerred.  I agree, and tell her that as long as I see progress I dont have any problem, so I agree to let her stay a little longer.  It doesnt take long until she is once again locked in her room all the time and my wife and I notice she is missing work more frequently.  By now she has met someone through a dating app so is also gone most weekends.  She no longer packs a lunch for work, but is now eating out everyday as well, but still has no money.  we go through about 3 more months of this and my wife and I are once again at the end of our rope.  fast forward to last week, and my wife goes into my sister's room looking for dishes, something that she had to do often, as my sister would leave them in her room along with all of her trash.  while in there, she finds the normal bowls, cups and plates along with partially eaten food.  she dropped a fork that bounced under the couch and went to grab it, and when she looked and found 18 empty vodka bottle (1pt size) and next to the couch were 2 1.75 liter bottles as well.  in her closet were about 4 more of the 1.75 liter bottles and several cups filled with her urine.  It was at that point we decided it was time for us to cut her loose.  My wife text her and told her that she has until the end of the month to find a new place.  what should we do?  are we in the wrong?  how long should we be expected to support her?  In the past I have asked her where all of her money goes, and her answer was "it is hard, I have always had a man to support me."  I quickly went through her income and bills with her and showed her where she should have about $900 left at the end of every month, and she just looked at me and said she doesnt know where it goes.  I would assume that along with the Vodka there are some other things she may be spending her money on, but would have no way to prove it.
It ain't easy but you already know what you gotta do. You have to put your family/children first. So yes, your sister has got to go. It's going to be painful. But just because she has to get the boot doesn't mean you can't soften the landing. I don't suggest renting a place for her or cosigning. But there are half way houses (transitional housing) everywhere in the States, especially for women like your sister. So if your willing to go an extra mile for your sister, find these places in your area and give them a call. Think of some questions to ask and write them down before you call. 
It's your sister so It's going to be extra hard. But your wife and children come first. Also it doesn't help tht she has been living with you guys and doesn't attempt to help. 9 months is more than enough and though is hard continuously giving her more time it's enabling her to continue not to take responsibility for herself. By the comments you've made she has always been dependent on someone and that someone can't be you anymore. Some people can't be helped I'm sure you've heard all the cliche quotes. Get serious and stop giving her more time. 
Your sister is a user in every sense of the word. She is using you and taking advantage of you and she knows it. Having her in the house isn't good for your and your wife and it definitely isn't good for your girls. I would be frank and tell her that the progress has stopped and you are done with her taking advantage of you. She has a month to move out, end of story. No extensions, no safety nets, nothing. If she thinks she can get around this deadline she will. Don't let her. What happens to her now is up to her. You are not causing her problems, even if she tries to put her problems on you. Any issues she has she has caused.
I'd like to hear stories where people have been accused of something which they've proven to be untrue. How has this affected you? How's it affected your life? What is your relationship with your accuser and your family?
My family sat me down through a series of interventions my junior year of high school trying to get me to "come out of the closet".

My best friend turned out to be gay, though he never made a pass at me. I got in a fight on the bus defending him and when my dad questioned the group of kid who showed up at my door that day with a bat, they told him i was defending a gay kid.

My family immediatly believed i was gay for the next 4-6 years. They only really shut up about it when they found the boxed pregnancy test i was hiding in my amplifier for my gf at the time.

Nothing i could say or do convinced them otherwise and they would lecture me for hours after school about how i need to tell someone and stop trying to hide it because i was only hurting myself, it got to a point that they were considering grounding me for lying about it. 

That was 10ish years ago. Now i have a wife and a 3 year old daughter. The kid i defended went on to get arrested last year for burning a baby with a hot lightbulb while the mother left him to watch her. I only hung out with him for a year in high school. My parents and his parents hated each other so much it caused a ton of drama and just became no longer worth it. He grew up to be a baby abuser so it was good i got away, but for all i know, it could have been the beginning of the downward spiral that put him behind bars.

TlDr: parents gave me interventions because they convinced i was gay and wouldnt admit it.
From ages 12-14 I was a total edge lord in school. I misbehaved in most of my classes. I was a total smart ass. I never wore the school uniform. And I got a lot of detentions and such. However, I always maintained a mostly A's report card. Never failed a class. Because of this, teachers thought I cheated and my mom thought I was still pretty "average" intelligence because I misbehaved and was never recommended for honors like my sister was. 

In 7th grade, we had a poetry assignment from my English teacher, who really did not like me and I misbehaved a lot in her class. But, I loved poetry, so I put my heart and soul into writing a horror poem. We worked on them in class, and I was quiet the entire time, working on my poem. When I got home, I typed it up and returned it the next day. 

When I got it back, I got an A+ and I was so proud of myself.  I dropped opened my mouth and literally almost teared up. I thought that the teacher had actually started to like me now and wasn't totally against me like I thought every adult was. 

But then, she called me up in front of the class and told me to bring my poem. I was all proud, thinking she would recommend me to the literature club or something. So I couldn't hold back the grin on my face while walking up to her desk. She looked me straight in the eyes, and said, "Did you plagiarize this poem?" It felt like my heart vomited into my stomach. I was so crushed. All I could say was "What?" a few times and she started getting upset with me. I got very defensive and told her, "I wrote the entire thing in class yesterday!"

She shook her head and just said, "Okay... if you say you didn't, then you didn't. But this is a serious offense. Are you sure?" She didn't believe me. I was so hurt. I walked back to my desk and laid my head down for the rest of class. Tears welled up in my eyes but I didn't want anyone to see me cry over something most 12 year old's would probably think is stupid.

Fast forward to my freshman year. My English teacher noticed my poems and had a talk with me. I thought it was going to be a repeat of 7th grade. She told me they were all amazing and she wanted to put me in Honors classes. But then my mom said that I'd never be able to handle it. My mom and I had a major argument over it. My mom told me I wasn't as smart as my sister and I shouldn't even try to get in. 

I went against her will and told my English teacher I accept the test to get in Honors. I took the test, passed it with flying colors. And went home and told my mom I made it.  I also got all A's in Honors English for the rest of high school and in college. My mom still thinks I am not that smart. She told me to stop all throughout school. I don't even understand why. I have given up on proving anything to her though. I think she just never wants to admit she is wrong.
I didn't get to experience a good father/daughter relationship so it makes me really happy when I see dad that actually care about their kids, and actually engage their kids and talk with them instead of ignoring them or just not actively involved in their lives.

I love (good) dads who are in their kids lives and have a close enough relationship with their kids to make dad jokes. Dad jokes are the best.

Too all the dad's out there that are involved in their kids lives, you rock! You may or may not realize but you're making the world a better place.
Aww. I am sorry you didn't have a great relationship with your dad. My relationship with my dad is better now that I am an adult. My husband is amazing with our girls. It melts my heart. They have him wrapped around their little fingers. He sings and dances with them. Right now they are both cuddling him. He wasn't sure if he wanted kids. He said if we did have them one or two tops. His heart burst wheb we had our first. Unfortunately, she had trisomy 18 and only lived six days. After that, he knew we were meant to have kids. We have two healthy, happy girls. If I hadn't needed a hysterectomy two years ago we would have one or two more. He is awesome with our friends' kids and now our niece. This weekend he was helping out neice learn to walk. I married a real winner :)
Thank you! As a stay at home dad I really appreciate it when people acknowledge the hard work a lot of dad's are doing. 

I'm sorry you didn't have a great relationship with your father, my desire to be a stay at home dad was because of my mediocre (on his good days) childhood. 

I hope my little girl has fond memories of her dad when she grows up. She amazes me more everyday.

 
This is great, your daughter will have fantastic memories about you I'm sure of it

It's great that you'll be able to have close relationships with your children

My dad is making up for it now with all the bad things from our childhood, but it isn't the same as being able to remember your dad as someone who was amazing when you were a kid, and I think your kids are really going to appreciate that
Dads like your husband make me happy :) good for you and good for your children
I was recently informed, by my wife no less, that a major reason toddlers will start to throw temper tantrums is because they become very frustrated in that they are unable to communicate with their parents as they can't talk clearly yet.  A remedy to this apparently is to teach your children sign language.  

I started researching the topic and found that some people start as young as 6 months, some even younger(getting a great late start with my 19 month old) and it really helps them communicate.  We started maybe 1-2 weeks ago and my son is already learning so much and picking it up quickly.  My issue is trying to find an easy way to learn sign language but in a way that I can teach my son at the same time, basically "How to speak baby with your hands"  that would be an amazing book.  

Does any one have some good suggestions on resources for learning sign language with a good baby mind set so we can use words that would be most important to him and his daily life?  Please feel free to message me on here or message me at my family blog --https://2dogsacatand1baby.wordpress.com/
Hi! I don't have children yet but I when I do I want to teach them sign language. I did a little Internet sleuthing and found a site that looks promising. 

 https://www.startasl.com/baby-sign-language_html

Good luck! Let us know how it goes.
We've done signs from the beginning with our 18 month old- I'd say just keep doing it! The common ones we use are: mama, dada, eat, water, juice, milk, more, please, thank you, help, up up, bird, fish, all done, bath time, book, sleep, kitty, puppy. We also tell her it's okay and ask her to sign help when she gets frustrated, and have been able to circumvent a few tantrums that way too :)

Edit: I forgot to add actual tips. Use the sign every time you use the word. Start with 3-4 you can do easily- I'd suggest eat, milk, more, all done- this way signing starts with meal times. Then introduce them at other times. We transition from dinner to bath and bath to book, and book to sleep. So bath, book, sleep were our next signs. They helped her learn transitions. The others we added in as we came across the words in books and I looked up new signs on YouTube. Really just doing a few at a time is manageable and you won't feel like your learning a new language all at once. 

She can now sign simple sentences like "please dada more eat" or "all done bath please book" it's so wonderful to know what she wants- best of luck!! 
I appreciate it, this looks pretty straight forward and simple.  I look forward to trying it out. 

My family lives in the same town as me... I tried to organize a Christmas dinner this year, but most people decided that they wanted to order pizzas and chill out rather than making a big deal out of the day. 

At the last moment my family decided to have a traditional Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve and didn't invite me - simply because they forgot about me.

I found out the next day when we were to do the pizza day (which didn't end up happening either). 

This is not a new situation with my family and I've talked to them about this before. Now I am wondering why I keep giving chances to people who clearly don't make an effort to make me feel like I belong. How do I build my own family and learn to let go of feeling abandoned (repeatedly)? 

Any advice on how to deal with this?
Holy shit, that must hurt, I'm sorry that happened to you.  I think you know the answer, build up your own true relationships and let go of your family as much as possible.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. I would seek therapy because it helps. Family isn't just blood, it can be the people you surround yourself with. Surround yourself with people deserving of your time.
My youngest brother (call him Chip) is in his mid-20s and part-way through undergrad at a local university, but discouraged with inconsistent academic performance. He needs to retake 1 calculus class in the spring to get into his university’s college of business and complete his studies. This isn’t that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. I told him yesterday about numerous friends of mine who took between 5 and 10 years to finish college and get jobs. Many went to his same university. The kid is in great physical shape so he 100% has the discipline to accomplish whatever the hell he wants.

&nbsp;

However, I’ve been the lucky one so it’s easy for me to say it’s not a big deal. My mom frequently told me how smart I was growing up while my dad set the expectation that I was to go to a prestigious in-state public school. Chip has transferred schools twice, grew up hearing my mom talking about learning disabilities, and was recently asked by my dad if he’s dumb. He is of completely normal intelligence but these are **debilitating** reinforcement loops.

&nbsp;

I am growing concerned for his mental and emotional health after seeing him choke back tears when my mom asked him about what our dad said (parents divorced). Considering our shared genetics and my own mental health deficiencies, I feel the need to confront my parents about Chip’s environment. Because I experience (and manage) suicidal thoughts from time to time, it’s really easy to envision him contemplating the same. However, I suspect anything I discuss with my parents would get back around to him and worsen that reinforcement loop. He lives at our mom’s and sees our dad most days of the week and otherwise has a fine relationship with both.

&nbsp;

It’s absolutely a priority of mine to continue helping him understand the steps he needs to take to finish undergrad. As an older brother, what is my role in:  
*1. Calling out either or both of my parents*  
*2. Getting the metaphorical horse to drink after leading it to water*

&nbsp;

Much appreciated. I love this kid and just want him to believe in himself.

It sounds like you are doing a great job. All you can do is to be supportive and to be there to talk if he needs it. He is an adult, so he is going to have to find his own way, just like you did. Just knowing he is support will help. My sister and I didn't really get along until we were adults and that was tough. It is great that we can talk know. It seems like your brother knows he can come to you. I think you are doing a great job.
I am an international student from China. I recently graduated from my master degree, and my mom flew here for my graduation. 

I should be happy, but I feel very uncomfortable now. Instead of staying in hotel, she wants to save money so she stays in my room(for twenty days). I live with three roommates and have a small room. Now I am very uncomfortable squeezing in the tiny room with her. 

She also wears my cloths without even asking for my permission. She also rearranges my stuff.

The other problem is that I have to work in the day. But she still have me try to help her shop, and gets the best deal possible. She would bargain at Ann Taylor and have me try to apply for store credit card so that she has additional discount. It seems like she does not get I have a job other than getting a bargain.  

She even says whenever I have a baby she will raise my baby for me, and stays with my place, for months... and she thinks it is ridiculous that I won't let her..

I am so stressed out and I don't dare standing up for my self because what she does is quite normal in China, but no at all normal in the US. 

All I want is a day or two being in my room all by myself doing nothin... but whenever I request time for myself or not seem like giving her enough attention she would guilt trick me, says she is my mom and I should respect her.

I feel like blowing up. I have another 15 days with her, and it is really hard for me. 

I always have problem sleeping, and while she stays in the same room with me I need to take night quill every night in order to get any sleep.  
Is going to a friend's house for the day/night not an option? Other than that just try to enjoy the time you have with your mom, you never know what can happen--When I was a kid i pretended to sleep when my mom kissed me goodbye before work, I didn't see her for 4 years after that cus she got deported that same day. Shes back now, and annoys me, but it's okay because I know what it's like to lose her. 
I understand it's hard, but some people won't have boundaries unless you put them up. You can't keep your mom in your room. That is so unfair to your roommates to have an extra person there for a month. That is just unacceptable. You have to tell your mom there is a time and a place for saving money and this is not it. There are places that will give you a discount for staying a certain amount of nights. But if she wants to stay she needs to go to a hotel. Staying with you puts your living arrangements at risk and being penny wise is going to be pound foolish. Meaning you will save a little up front and end up paying more in the end. 

You also have to be very clear. You have a job. You support yourself. You can't go shopping with her because you have to work. If she wishes to stay she needs take care of herself while you work or she needs to go home. Inkmow it is hard for her to understand. This isn't her country or her ways. But she needs to respect you. If she can't then you won't have an other options than to arrange for her to go home.

It is harsh, but it needs to happen. 
I have to add that she stays with me for about 15 days, and then we travel to Florida together for 10 days. I insist that so that my roommates are fine with it. My roommates are loud and messy themselves, and bring people over all the time. 

I need to be very strict with her next time she wants to visit. I have to insist that she cannot stay at my place no matter what. 
True. Setting boundaries feels really bad when you first start. You might feel guilty or wonder if you're doing the wrong thing, but it's way harder the longer you let it go on. I think you're well aware of that based on her comments on what would happen with your hypothetical future children. Ultimately, it's your life and you have to strike a balance between being with your family and living your own life. Good luck!
Unpleasant, hard, difficult, and saddening.

Maybe people with easy families don't feel it, but they kinda get harder every year. I honestly prefer the build up to holidays more because it is more peaceful.
Feel the same way. I'm not looking forward to sitting in a room with people who claim to be family yet have zero things in common other than DNA. It's sad because I know the only reason we are all there is because our grandparents want us to be together with them but if they weren't alive we wouldn't bother getting together. Pretty sad. I feel your pain, the build up to the holidays are far better than the actual day.
I'm sorry. It can be hard when things are tense and you are there out of a sense of obligation. I hope you have the best holiday you can and if you need to vent, I am here any time.
My mom was just diagnosed with terminal cancer and the doctors don't expect her to live past January 2017. This was sprung on all of us just a week ago. I would like to give my mom a great Christmas/Birthday gift (her birthday is January 9th). What would you give a close family member in this type of situation? 
I gave my nanna a huge photo book. Just went though all the families FB, old camera files and scanned older ones. She loved it, passed away just after Christmas.

Its simple but so special.

I'm sorry you're All going through a tough time :(
I would write a letter telling her how much she means to you. Pictures and homemade things are always good. Show her how much you care. I am so sorry you are going through this. Best of luck.
My mom is a typical "can't mind her own business/has her opinion about everything you do in your life" kind of person. She's a critical, mean woman and I hate being around her. I'm a recent college grad currently living at home for another few months and try to avoid her at all costs all the time.

She recently told my sister and I that she wants to go on a family vacation and to start saving to go with her but that sounds like a circle of hell to me. Am I required to go? Why would I want to go on a vacation with a woman who gets jealous that I go on business trips and then proceeds to tell me I didn't deserve that opportunity??!?

I'm trying to figure a way to get out of it but no luck yet. Any suggestions? She seriously reduces me to tears everytime I am around her and we talk about anything other than my dog (random fact but true).
'No' is a complete sentence. 

You can't get off work. 

You don't want to waste your precious vacation being lectured.

You won't be able to afford it.

You just don't want to. Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain) just say 'no, mom, I'm not going. Have fun with sister.'
Yeah, just say no, Nancy.  

My sister got pregnant before she was 16, she has two sons, I saw her doing weed while she was pregnant with the second child and she was dating a guy who grew and sold weed. She's moved into a council house near our parents since this because her boyfriend became abusive. I don't know if she still does drugs. My parents look after the children on weekdays because they live right next to the school, but my sister only lives a mile away from the school. My parents pretty much ignore them and I went through neglect and child abuse when I was younger, so I really hate the idea of them going through the same. I left home when I was young and became successful because I didn't feel like I had a choice. I'm highly professionally qualified now so money isn't an issue. I've spoken to my sister about it but she thinks they're ok in their current school. I know how shit the school is because I went to it myself. My sister doesn't work and I want her children to have exposure to an environment where you are rewarded for hard work, rather than just bored on benefits. I also have better schools and children's clubs around me (>100 miles from my sister's house). Last time they visited the youngest nephew said he wanted to stay here with me and she said "you can keep him if you want" in a few months that's going to become possible. My main concern is that I left home for a reason, whenever I see my nephews and sister my abusive parents invite themselves along and I just don't want to see them after what they did to me, but I don't want to allow them to do it to my nephews. I also don't want them to feel like they're different for living with their aunt, but I want to help because I know that I wished someone would help me when I was younger, I was surprised my parents' families didn't help out and they definitely knew it was bad because I'd call my grandparents on the phone to calm down my mum when she went mental.
So wait, would you want them to live with you then? If you think theyre being neglected or subject to abuse and want to be their guardians then that might be something to speak to social services about, I have heard stories about family members being granted custody of children of their parents are deemed unfit.
/u/KingXRiku is right. If they are not capable of caring for these kids and you are you need to get CPS involved so you can gain legal custody of these kids. 
I'm happy to have them live with me. 

I don't think they're in any immediate danger and I don't think social services would want to officially take them away from their mum.

I think looking after them informally by telling my sister what I could offer them might work, but they're her kids at the end of the day and I don't want to try something that might fail, and be accused of trying to steal her kids because I don't have my own. I literally just want to do what's best for them because I remember what it's like to have toxic parents.

I'll ask if I can look after them for a few weeks, she's let my parents do that with them for 6 weeks while she was abroad.
But if social services don't think they're in danger, then they'll prefer for them to stay with her, and my relationship with my sister will be ruined. I think an informal agreement is best, like "I'll take them off your hands so you can concentrate on more important things"..
I understand what you are saying, but she is going to create instability. She will use the kids to get what she wants from you. She will threaten to taken them and you will have no legal standing. She may even extort money out of you. You will be in a really bad position and so will those kids.
Hi, so I'm 16, and still in high school. A few weeks ago we found out my mom might have breast cancer, and now it's looking like she does. MY dad killed himself when I was 2 and then my mom remarried. If something happens to her, what will happen with me? I have 5 adult siblings that are blood related, so would I live with them, or with my stepdad?
I am very sorry for what you are going through. You would have to talk with your family about this. If there is someone you would want to live with I would hope they would step up. That said, breast cancer doesn't mean your mom is going to die. Some people die from it and others fight it and go into remission. Are you just scared of the future or was she given a grim prognosis. 
Scared of the future, my family tends to not have good luck when it comes to death. We find out today if she even officially has cancer, but like I said, my family doesn't have the best of luck. Thank you for responding and giving me the info I asked for.
I understand. My family has pretty bad luck too. I wish you the best. If you ever need someone to talk to I am here any time.
Allright, so earlier this evening I went down to brush my teeth. A few minutes later I see my mum walking down wrapped in one of my flags (I am a huge history and vexiology geek) as if it where a towel. Seeing that she wasn't wearing a bra and that she was wrapped in the flag made me draw the conclusion that sje was naked underneath it.

So, I said in a loud voice ( I wasn't screaming mind you) "oh for god sake use a towel instead of my stuff" to which she replied "I can wash it if you want"

I responded with a rude "ew no now I don't want it"

In anger she burst out" it's sad that my own son is uncomfortable with his mum's body" she dropped the towel and angrily marched upstairs. I noticed that she was in fact wearing panties undereath.

So: did I overreact or should my mum have taken my stuff into consideration.

I am 14 years old if that matters.
She was wrong to use your flag. You could have  been nicer, but she was still wrong.
You're in the right. What flag was it?
It just seems kinda weird that she'd use a flag instead of a towel
I don't see hoe that is relevant but it was the flag of Catalonia.
I'm also interested in Vexilology and just wanted to know. Catalonias a pretty cool one tho :^) 
It is! I love the contrast between the red,yellow stripes and the deep blue triangle.
Bear with me guys this might be a long one

I’m a 21 year old female who was born and raised in the middle east, and I grew up in a very conservative Muslim household. Currently I live in the US as I complete my bachelor’s degree and during my time here I’ve met this amazing and wonderful woman who I’m proud to call my girlfriend. My sister lives and studies in the same State as I do and has been very accepting of my sexuality, which I have always been grateful for, however recently my parents have been worried about her for a bunch of different reasons. So my Dad abruptly booked an airplane ticket and is going to be visiting us this week, and my sister and I are so tired of having to constantly lie about our lifestyles, they would never accept the fact that we drink, don’t cover our hair when they aren’t around, and don’t dress modestly enough, let alone the fact that I’m gay and my sister is planning on marrying her non Muslim American boyfriend. 

During my Dads trip my sister might end up telling him about her engagement which is going to be an absolute shit storm, and I kind of understand why she’s in a bit of a rush to tell them, its very exhausting for both of us to hide such important aspects of our lives, and considering the fact that she’s almost 30 years old and I’m an adult too but we still have to answer to our parents like children can be very demeaning. 

If his visit goes as badly as it could then it means that we would lose all connection with our family, and that I could lose my scholarship (because it’s provided by our embassy and legally back home a woman is considered to be a dependent until she gets married) so if my dad wants them to stop our scholarship he easily could, which would mean I would lose my student visa. If that were to happen and I decide to marry my girlfriend then I can stay in the States, but I won’t have a college degree, and I barely have any work experience because you aren’t allowed to work on a student visa. I just have this never ending gut wrenching feeling about all this, I’m scared I won’t be able to support myself, I’m scared I might never speak to my family again, I’m scared I won’t be able to see my nieces and nephews grow up.

For those who made it this far thank you for reading and thank you for your patience, any advice would be greatly appreciated

I am so sorry you are in this position. I am a mom and it makes me so angry that people can bring children into this world and then just abandon them when they don't act exactly as they would like. I just want to make it clear that your parents are in the wrong here. There is nothing shameful about how you and your sister lived your lives.  You shouldn't have to hide who you are. The problem is your scholarship. 

How long do you have until graduation? I would try to schedule an appointment with your advisor as soon as you can. An advisor may be able to help by giving you ideas on how you can get financial aid. I don't know how much time you have until his visit, so that makes things tricky. I don't like the idea you may have to pretend to be something you aren't because you shouldn't have to, but I also understand that your situation is a difficult one. I imagine your girlfriend doesn't want to hide your relationship  (which I understand too). It is hard because you are in a no win situation.

I had a friend from the Middle East, but he was Catholic and a man, and he had a lot more freedoms. He did have some issues. He died a few years ago from cancer, and the truth is he was a lot different than they believed. His parents insisted on certain things when they were here. They didn't seem to understand that he lived differently than them because life is a bit different here. His sister spent some time with us after he died and she felt like she didn't even know him anymore. It was sad. I have to imagine it is incredibly hard to reconcile two cultures that are so different.

I would follow your instincts and do what you think is best. Talk to your advisor and see if you can find a way to have a safety net. Hopefully, you can find a way to secure your education so you don't have to give it up. I am so sorry that you have to worry about it.
Thankfully, you're in the USA, right?

I think the issues are complicated, but the one that stands out right now is the vulnerability of your scholarships and visa status.  So, b/c of the importance of these ....and the far reaching consequences of their cancellation...it sounds like you need to (regrettably) continue keeping your private lives private...which should be easier since your dad is coming just for a brief visit.

The other issues you raise are valid and real and important, but this might not be the right time to raise them.
Perhaps this relates more to 80s and 90s parents:

You get told to be polite, always put others first, speak when spoken to...

20 yrs on, when all your friends who are louder, more confident, a little more wise to the ways of the world are highly successful -

Your parents give you a constant hard time for not 'doing as well' as her friend's son, who only got a second class degree, or her other friends daughter who was as good as you at biology in college...

This is my basic problem with my mum.  

I'd just like to share!  Thanks.


How can I make my wife understand that our relationship is about us and to not take her mothers opinions as her own?

I guess this is what happens when you marry a happy woman that probably never rebeled against her parents ideals no matter how absurd they were.

-Her life story-
Was born in the west coast. Prior to her birth her father was already engaged and had other children somewhere in this world. I guess he decided to stay with my mother in law because she didnt stand up for herself she let him do whatever (Drink. Watch porn at home. Smoke tobacco. Watch other women in the street ) she'd cry about it later at night. My wife has two other brothers 21 and 26 also a sister 16.
When my wife was in her younger years thats when most of the drama took place. My wife and her siblings were left at their grandmas house for a couple years out of the country. Later their parents came back and moved here to chicago, because of the "weather" they moved to california back and forth eventually my father in law gave up his catholic past even though they had gotten married through that cult idea. The family became christian and the father and mother gave up their old ways he never smoked or drank again and she never.... Yeah again.

It is then the year two thousand and some bullsh!t my wife is hitting her puberty and her brothers are going through it. So they have moved back to chicago at an uncles house and my mother in law gets raped by him no one other than my wife finds out ever. So they move back to california. Then they moved back into a house that they finally rent themselves.

Due to the constant moving and changing of schools the siblings end up beign some years behind in their school and grades. On top of this they dont get pushed at all and instead they are encouraged to stay at home whenever they dont want to go to school. My wife graduated on time she pushed herself out of highschool so did her older brother.

My wife grew close to her mom when they would get peeped on whenever naked by the uncle and even the father they also talked about the rape occurence very often. This made my wife a little repulsive to men as she grew older. So she was careful with who she choose to date.

-My punitive life story-
Moved to chicago had a very loving family, not much to complain about here. My family isnt perfect we also have disagreements and argued. I didn't grow with many videogames or toys we struggled alot. In the middle of my puberty I started to dislike my moms laws I decided to be a fat, lazy, slob and not help her around the house and talk back often. Then in my junior year I realized my parents efforts and I changed, I started helping them more often and got more interested in school now I am not a peasent anymore I joined the PC master race. After graduating I really wanted a job in IT which I found but took for granted and got fired a year later. I was young and stupid I thought these jobs were easy to find without a college degree and or technicall experiance. So I went back to college as a waste of time since I was afraid of getting in debt plus I only needed a couple years of college experience to make my resume look nice. I started working partime for balance. Thats it my life is pretty lame.

-Meeting up-
We met at a part time job she was going to the same college as me but we had never met. I showed her kindness everyday and made her laugh too. We both fell deeply in love and messed around all day. Sometimes we would skip work and go to the mall. We quit working there on the same day. For the 4th of july we trespassed into a location at the lake michigan and had sex there 3 times in the open air. That day I proposed to her with a custom made ring. We had lots of fun together. I think the main reason we enjoyed ourselves was because she wasnt afraid of getting caught or getting in "trouble" by her parents. We did end up getting a ticket and a fine for trespassing months later when we came back and tried to do it again.

-Marriage-
So we got married in September I knew we were too young but Im very comprehensive after having had lived years with my nagging mother I learned how to shut the fvck up and not cause trouble. Before getting married I let my wife know that I didn't care if she didn't know how to cook or if she had cleanning habits, after all we would learn along the way. I also let her know that we were not from rich parents and might not be financially successful but its managable. Finally I told her that I left my family and everything else to be with her I have no need or ever want to go back to my parents I'm very independent. 
I guessed she missed the messege because she felt insulted everytime I asked her what she did know how to cook or what she wanted to eat. Also she would complain about the cleanning which I let her know that we could just do it on a certain day. They were small things though we still enjoyed beign married alot we went out and always had fun even during the snow we would cuddle up in bed all day.
It was very fun.
One day I left for work and left my old phone in a drawer unlocked. She read all the messeges I had sent my Exes in the past and she got very upset. I left work that day to come talk to her and be with her. Im loyal and would never cheat on her. But after that day she started to complain about how I was looking at women when walking at the mall or anywhere public. Im not going to lie but beign constantly told that you are looking made me watch out for myself "looking" even if I wasn't. I gave up those "I wasnt looking conversations" there is no point in fighting back if you are innocent. But she kept going.
Eventually we would go out too much and our car debt, rent, all other bills became over bearing. So we decided to move in with her parents cause we would live on the top floor and they vowed not to bother us. The rent is so cheap living with them it helps a lot.
In the few months of living with her parents her mother was not true to her words she would come up and knock on our door just to ask a stupid question. She would ask my wife for dumb favors that her other kids could do for her. Im pretty sure she could hear when we were going hard so she would come upand knock on our door and if we didnt open she would yell my wife's name. My wife always felt obligated to do what her mom told her. But I would talk to her and told her how I felt about her mom without beign rude 

We used to go to church all the time and sit through the pastor indirectly saying crap about us. Then listening to the people crying eventually this got boring to me the hypocrisy was too much to handle, these people always cry for their mistakes but dont stop doing them. I told my wife that I dont force her into my church so I would like for us to stop going. She said yes eventually it was a little hard to convise her. 
After we stopped going to church her mother got really upset she would messege my mom on facebook and tell her that Im not being a husband, I never have food in the fridge, I never treat them with respect whatever.. My parents knew it was BS but they felt awkward beign in that position. They never responded to her messeges. I was and am always kind to my Mother by Law.
What made me not like my MBL the most was because when we were dating she had an argument with my wife and then the brother of 21yrs old slapped my wife in the face. He was pulling her hair too and the worst thing is the Mother encouraged him to be more aggressive and to slap her again. This really pissed me off my wife still has the audio recording. I can't understand why my wife never did anything back.


So now the problem persists. Even though I have talked to her mother. I told her to back off and to not talk crap to my wife about me because in the end I didn't care what she thinks about me.

But now the old hag messages my wife dumb stuff. And makes her kids come up and knock on our door just to get my wife for stupid questions. Sometimes she feeds my wife breakfast in the morning and doesn't offer me anything. She uses our stuff and keeps it dowstairs like its hers unless I go and use it. She uses our WiFi for free. Her older children seem to be irresponsible they could easily pay for their own internet. 

She is so annoying but we can't move out because we have a child on the way and she is a stay at home mother she can take care of the baby for free... (i hope) she already tried charging us for cooking. We turned her down I rather buy food and make it than to pay for the rest of her children.

This woman is crazy if she wants her daughter back but fails to acknowledge that her daughter wont be happy without me. 

Wtf should I do???? My wife gets angry when I talk the truth about her mother and Im stressed and frustrated. I think I just need a divorce.
[deleted]
Thank you! This has really stressed me out I've talked to the mother in law multiple times and nothing seems to change. This is so dumb and I wish everyone could get along I help them out in so many ways. The mil keeps saying im the one with the problem but I get along perfectly fine with everyone else in the family.
I have a loud obnoxious family member that makes fun of me as well as other people. They are introduced to new people and come up with unpleasant nicknames for them. I've done nothing to this person but have limited conversation with them because of their behavior. Does anyone else have a family member that you can't stand and why?
My aunt's husband has done some shady things including not writing my grandma's will the way she wanted it...twice. he is a lawyer and he basically was making it so he and my aunt got everything. My grandparents did everything for them and they didn't do much for my grandpa when he was dying and don't do a lot for my grandma. They are basically waiting for her to die so they can take her house. At least, that is how I feel. I have seen them do shady things that make me uncomfortable, but my grandma allows it and she is fully there mentally, so there is nothing I can do. It makes me really angry.
Oh, yes. My cousin is a very patronizing person. She is charismatic and funny, but she has the tendency to belittle other people, especially her younger sister. She also would do anything to appear cool and have every littke thing go her way, which is rediculous since she's 27, married+2. Like seriously, grow up lady.
I don't even know what to say to that. That's really despicable, is there anyway to prove that he did that? Are there any other family members that can verify what your grandmother's last wishes are? I'm assuming your grandmother isn't aware of the situation or capable of handling it.
Oh, we all know what he did. She won't change her won't change her will because she wants to honor my grandpa's wishes and it was what they decided. She did finally have it done by someone outside the family. It was discussed a lot, belive me.
I was talking with some family and friends 
I told them that when I marry the wife would come first 
Then the children 
So they asked if the children or wife was drowning who would I save 
I told them my wife 
My vow was to the my wife not the children that I made a promise to always protect and take care of her.
Most said I was wrong
But what are your opinions
Well, it's subjective, but in my opinion, you are dead wrong. I love my husband. Before kids my husband was absolutely number one. The children were a choice. They are culmination of our love and hope for the future. You think you know how much you would love you kids, but you don't until you have them. That love is beyond what I can explain. If I could save my husband and kids and it meant I would drown I would do it in a heartbeat. We both agree the kids come first in this kind of situation. No question.
Based on unemotional logic, your spouse should come first. You can make more children, but you cannot replace an adult. I hope I never have to find out if I would choose my husband or my son in a life or death situation; either would be devastating and life shattering. There is no good choice when you take emotion into consideration. 

Moreover, your spouse is who you will spend the rest of your life with, your partner, and you made a promise to forsake all others for them, not all others except for children. Your children will leave to embark on their own lives. They owe you nothing. So in a day to day sense, as long as no one is in any danger, your spouse should be your number one. 
All of you make very good points 
Each person and family has their own ways 
And it's interesting to see other peoples opinions 
Maybe you are right viperbunny 
I don't have kids so I won't know but I am positive I will still feel the same way 
But I know that my soon to be wife would chose the children over me 
I have no problem with that 
And just like averyincredabilehulk said 
It doesn't mean that I will love the children less and I won't see her as loving me less if she was to do it 
I agree with ladybargod  it will be devastating no matter who gets left behind 
I think your choice is the best. My first commitment is to save my wife. Together we may have a chance at a rescue round two.

There's a reason they tell you on airplanes to put your own mask on first before helping kids in case of cabin pressure loss. You have to keep your head even in an emergency. This doesn't mean you love your kids any less, it means that you are being smart about how to act on that love. 

This applies in our relationship with each other, and with the kids. If we don't take time to nurture our spousal relationship, our performance as parents will suffer. Daddy would never override Mommy's decisions just to make the kids happy, and Mommy would never do that to Daddy either. 
If my children and husband were drowning and I had to choose, I would choose my children any day. I can't really explain why. I love my husband. But my love for my children is different. All-encompassing, blinding, unquestioning. My children are my blood. I grew them inside of me. I knew them before they could speak, and to me they will always be those fragile things whose wellbeing I have been charged with. It's instinctual, man. 
I would say the children. 

Part of becoming a parent is doing anything for your children, including giving up some thing you love and putting them before even yourself.

You choose your spouse, your children don't get to choose their parents - they have no one but you to rely on.
My opinion is that people who bring up these arguments of who you would save in a disaster albeit parent, spouse, children, which child, have way too much spare time and no real problems in their lives.

I do not know personally one person who has ever had to decide which family member to save in a tragedy. Having such discussions can lead to nothing good. Every family member would like to think they would be saved first. These conversations remind me of those regarding what people would do if they received a financial windfall. People can get really worked up about stuff that will never happen.

I do think a spouse needs to come first in family relationships. Children need a strong family unit and that doesn't happen when children are first. If I were you I would skip sharing your philosophy on marriage with your friends and family and stick to safer subjects like sports.

Also don't share personal relationship and marital issues with friends or family. It weakens the family structure and can cause all sorts of problems. I would keep your dating and eventual marital issues to yourself.
This. Plus, it would be worse for everyone for the children to lose a parent. [Insert social studies backing me up here.] (I'm a wife and mother, FWIW.)

Also, OP, it would be much easier to read if you added punctuation.

I think all parents do that at some point. No one can be perfect in even one aspect of their lives, you know? It's not realistic.
Not really that much... Actually I'm the one that has disappointed them. They always had a lot of expectations for me and I just never really followed them. 

I do not feel too bad, but sometimes I just wish that they had a moment with me where they could be proud. Me playing in an orchestra, participating in a sporting event, something like that. Instead every conversation with them is more or less the same - I have to tell them that everything is normal, I'm just getting along, all is fine. Nothing has happened and nothing ever will happen.
Many times, but the ones that hurt the worst were the many times when I was 5-7 years old and my alcoholic BPD mother promised to pick us up (parents divorced, dad had custody) and never showed. I remember sitting by the door and crying all day.
Yes they have. What hurt me the most was this one time. Me and my band had landed a pretty big gig and were going to play on a big stage, at least by our standard. We got the gig and when I told my family they were happy and said that they might come down with my siblings to watch us play. They where/a bit... conservative when it comes to music so I totally respect that they weren't into the music we were making at the time (not too bad stuff, funk-rock-ish) and I was glad to hear that they would watch my band anyway. However time passed by and they ended up not coming. They had work to do and it would be late at night etc. I thought it was a shame, but fine. Then after the gig and many weeks later I started to realize that I wasn't ok with it. They had hurt me and pretty bad. I'm ok with that my parents didn't enjoy our music, but I'm still their child and I would really have appreciated if they came to watch.

I'm not too good with words and might not sound like the end of the world but at that time of my life and under the circumstances, I really wanted them there - if not for anything else so for my own sake.

If I sometime become a parent on my own I'll make sure not to do the same to my child.
Lol all my life. 

My mom had me at 18 and never grew up. She still acts like a teenager sometimes (though now she's moved onto more early twenties) I'm 21 and am more mature than her 90% of the time, plus I'm having my first baby with my fiance of 6 years. 

Luckily my dad got custody of me when I was 3, otherwise I'd be a disaster. 
They don't believe in me or my dreams. They don't really encourage me to go for what I want. And now they wonder why I'm so pessimistic. 
I don't have one, I am one.  Seems like some of the people on justnomil are actually nutters themselves.
I don't think crazy daughter in law's are as common especially for redditors who are mostly youger. But it would be nice to hear the MILs point of view and read their stories. If there's not one you should make one, I'll subscribe!
I want to hear their stories to make sure it's not anything I do!  But I don't know how to make a subreddit

I don't know how to talk to my mom. I feel like she downplays my own problems, doesn't listen to me when I try to connect with her EVEN WHEN IT'S SOMETHING SHE'S GOING THROUGH, and I feel like she uses me as a tool for venting. I think in her mind she can do no wrong and she's always right. She does have a tendency to assume that if something isn't working, that I'm doing something wrong. Sometimes that's true, but sometimes it's also something that I can't control, or it's a factor that other people are controlling that end up not working in my own...but her first, second, third, and sometimes even fourth or fifth assumption is that I messed up on something so it's my fault. 

I moved away from her a couple years ago to live in Arizona, just about as far away from her as I could get. It was good for a while, then I lost my job and had to move back. I feel like abandoning her was a last ditch effort so that my suicidal thoughts didn't come to fruition. Sometimes I have nightmares of her just yelling at me, a giant red face that gets louder and redder and closer until if fills my entire view. I don't want to run away from this situation again. I want to resolve it with her and get her to change her ways, and I'm willing to listen to her for what she wants.

But when starting this conversation, she will interrupt me and tell me only what I need to do to fix this ... I am not my own mother. I don't live by myself. And as much as I love her, I can't completely block out the hurtful words she says to me. She seems to be able to block anything I say to her and she outwardly puts up a show as if to say, "whatever you say to me wont matter because I know I'm right and I know you're wrong".

I love my mom so much. Hearing her say and seeing her do the things she does is so hurtful to me that recently I've been suicidal again. There's nowhere left for me to go so I've just gotten so much worse. I don't understand why we can't just talk normally and for us to have an equal relationship. I don't want to leave her...I don't want to leave any of this. But I'm so close to just giving up on my life BECAUSE of my mother and I realize that's not right nor is it healthy.

I'm too poor to afford any specialist, and I don't think she'd be willing to go see one with me anyway. There just isn't any respect from her end to my end, and that's heartbreaking. She's some of the only family I've got and I want her approval, I want her to be happy with me, I want HER to be happy....I don't know what to do.
You need to stay away from this toxic situation. You are so unhappy that it is causing you serious distress. This can't keep happening. You need to stop worrying about what makes your mom happy and start worrying about making yourself happy. You can't live your life for her. You can't be around someone who makes you so miserable. I would check out /r/raisedbynarcisusstists. That could help. Also, the people at the suicide holiness are there all the time.

Hang in there. Try to keep perspective in this trying time.  You've been happy on your own and you will be happy again. 
Three years ago I was sitting in a hospital trying to rest before having a c section. I was so excited. My baby was coming and she got the awesome birthday, 12/12/12. We had lost her sister the year before to trisomy 18, and we were so excited for the chance to be parents again. 

I was so nervous. Every test said she was healthy. Every kick and punch, and roll told me she was an active kid. I was terrified about going back into that OR. I was worried about everything. I wanted to be a great mom, but could I measure up? 

I didn't get to spend much of the first few days. I almost bled to death having her and I wasn't expected to live. I beat those odd. Holding my daughter for the first time is a feeling that words can't begin to describe. It was like I had everything I had every hoped and dreamed of in my arms. I didn't know what the future would bring, but I knew it would be great.

Three years later and I have an amazing little girl. She is a great big sister (her little sister is 17 months old). She is so smart and funny and kind. She love to draw and sing. She never stands still. She makes me laugh and smile even when things get tough. She loves life. She says our cat, Joe, is her best friend. She makes new friends wherever she goes. She solves difficult puzzles in under 30 seconds (I don't know how she does it)! My life has never been the same. It's been better. I don't know how I got so lucky, but I am so grateful. I have a beautiful family and a beautiful life.

I am so proud to be her mom :)
Amazing, Happy Birthday little girl!
I understand that these are hard times and that people need a little help now and again. However, we have a clear policy on asking for money. There is /r/Assistance for these types of posts.

If you see a post asking for assistance, please report it. I will be doing my best to remove these post as I see them.
I feel like when I get married or have kids they won't be there to see it 
That is a difficult thing to face.  I'm 43 and my parents are almost 70, I don't think it ever gets easier to realize they won't be around forever.  Make the time count of course, but also be sure to save as much of them as you can to share your parents with your kids.  Photos, videos, written memories, mementos etc to help keep them alive in spirit both for you and your future family.
I mean, it's not impossible. Plenty of people in my family have made it into their 90s.

It's obviously a tough situation, but there's not much you can do about it other than enjoy your time with them, get to know them as best you can.
I am a mom to two small children and reading this makes my heart hurt for you. I am only 29, but the thought that something could happen and I could die and leave my kids terrifies me (I am having some health issues). 

All I can say is to cherish the time you have with them. I agree with /u/bdubble. Do your best to have things to remember them by. None of us know how much time we have. Cherish what you have for as long as you can.


Their memory will shape your future with your own family. Be brave and proud, and forgiving.
My grandmother's birthday is October 28th.  In 2011, she chose to spend her birthday at my mom's house.  I, for whatever reason, thought her birthday was on the 29th that year.  I was going to travel to my mom's on the 29th, a Saturday, to celebrate it with her.  She passed away that Friday night in her sleep.  So, when I arrived that Saturday, I was extremely stricken with guilt.  I felt extremely guilty for missing her last birthday on this earth (she was my last living grandparent) and I was distraught with grief.  I lived about 3 hours the opposite direction of my mom's house, and upon arriving and finding out she had passed, we traveled another 3 hours to my grandmother's house for the funeral and to go through her things.  While going through her things, I came upon a little plaque I had purchased for her in Arkansas and given to her for her birthday exactly a decade earlier.  Due to the nature of the message on the plaque, I was going to offer it to my mom.  As I took it off the wall, my mom suggested I should keep it. So I did.  I placed it in a box with a few other trinkets I had given to her and my grandfather over the years.  The evening after her funeral, the last night I would spend in my grandparent's house, I was going through my little box of memories when I came upon the plaque I had given her.  I still was guilt-stricken for having missed her last birthday and last day on this earth.  However, something drove me to look at the backside of the plaque, so I turned it over.

Front Side: http://imgur.com/CkneBg1

Back Side: http://imgur.com/GM67560

I edited out my full name in the larger black box and first name in the second smaller one, but that message really moved me and brought me an immeasurable degree of comfort.  I cannot put into words how much peace the message on the back of a gift I had given her a decade before brought me.  I loved my Grandma to every end of this earth, and to find that message on the back of a gift that I had given her... her knowingly placing a message of love... when she'd know I'd need it most.  Words cannot describe.  Thank you, Grandma, for the foresight to leave such a message knowing I'd find it when I needed it the most.  I love you too.

I'm very sorry for your loss. We never know how much time we have. It sounds like your grandma knew that and was celebrating her life. It's going to hurt, there is no way around it, but it seems like she loved you very much. Please don't beat yourself up over this. Sometimes things happen and we can't change them.
This is extremely random and a shot in the dark but I figured it's worth a shot.  On December 27th, UPS delivered a box of Pampers Cruisers Size 4 which we (naturally) assumed was our usual shipment from Amazon.com.  I opened the box on Sunday to discover that instead of a box full of diapers, I got a box full of a baby girl's belongings.  NOT an incorrect order of new merchandise but a box that had been carefully packed with a baby girl's blankets, little lovey toys, sippy cups, fitted sheets for a crib, bibs, and the like.  

THERE IS NO IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ON THE BOX.  I spent an hour on the phone with both UPS and Amazon.  Unfortunately, since there is no shipping label, they both say there's not much they can do.  (And Amazon suggested I donate the items to charity...)  

As a mom, it breaks my heart to think that someone has lost these precious items.  There is a Taggie blanket with the name Constance Grace embroidered on it and a little make up bag monogrammed with the initials BJR.  That's about the extent of any identifying information on or in the box.  My hope is that this box happened to be on that UPS truck because the owner lives in the area (we're in Great Falls).  If you know someone with a baby girl named Constance Grace, please reach out to me!  I'd love to reunite baby girl with her blankies and lovey toys!

Thank you!

Best of luck finding the owners. It's really great of you trying to locate the owner. You may want to post it to a few other places, as this subreddit isn't that big. I really hope you find the owners. No matter what, you have tried, which is a lot more than most people would do. It's always great to know there are good people out there :)
You could try the subreddit in your area. Good luck. 
Everything from my childhood is gone. 

Thank goodness my family is okay. They won't have a house for months, but no one was hurt. I would just like to take this time to be thankful for each and every one of my family members <3 After losing our mother, we cannot go through that grief again. Items are replaceable. People are not. Remember that as the holidays approach. Do not forget what they are really about. 


I'm so sorry for all your family is going through.
I'm so sorry. I'm glad that you at least realize how important family really is.
Erin Cox, Massachusetts Teen, Punished By School After Trying To Drive Home Intoxicated Friend 
http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/highschool-prep-rally/erin-cox-suspended-massachusetts-prep-volleyball-player-being-163652983.html

Yeah, sure....she was just going there to give drunk people a ride home lol
http://valleypatriot.com/erin-cox-confesses-to-drinking-at-underage-party-that-gained-national-attention-the-history-of-a-bogus-media-story-that-never-happened/
This is Unbelievable!  Totally not the right call!
This is incredibly frustrating. As a captain of her team, being a leader on AND off the court is true leadership. She was doing just that and is being punished. Not cool.
I think that the Mothers Against Drunk Driving [response](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/15/sober-driver-drunk-friend/2988991/) is equally as telling how these people seem to be missing the point. By simply saying "Well the person should have called their parents" completely undermines any credibility they have. That's just IMO, I'm probably just overemphasizing it. 
Update:   Fox news reports late Wed. nite, Erin's family sued the school and the schools lawyer lied in court saying thst she had been arrested for teen drinking.  The police that were on the scene that night say she wasn't arrested and did nothing wrong.  The MADD organization backs the school even though they know Erin is innocent of any wrong doing.  I think MADD is a good name for that outfit now and the school is trying to cover their butt now.  What ever happened to plain old common sense? 
I think we have a massive ruse here. My Facebook news feed is full of stories that do not match hers at all from people at the party !!! She is a minor so I am hesitant to post exacts but me thinks we were all duped by her story.
Sadly this is the society we live in today. Good deeds are far more likely to be punished than bad ones. 
how can we talk to our parents? how can we tell our parents about our secrets without any hesitance in our hearts? how can we trust our parents?
Personally I don't go to my parents about issues I feel like they would judge me for. I have other people, people I consider actual adults that actually care about my well being and won't judge me, that I talk to if I feel like I can't go to my parents about something. And usually I can't tell them, that's just our relationship.
So it's sort of a lot. My parents divorced when I was 5 and my dad had FULL custody if that already doesn't shed enough light on my mom. Basically she's been dating this alcoholic jerk since I was 12 (so 15 years). He's been an alcoholic psycho from day one. He's inappropriate pushed boundaries with me sexually and both my brother and I physically. Any woman in her right mind would've left him 15 years ago. I just purchased my first home last year, I saved and did it all on my own. Up until now, I've never been close to my mom (as a kid I would see her every other weekend IF that, during high school and college I didn't even speak to her because of stuff her boyfriend did to me in junior high). We just started getting close because she lives 10 minutes from me. She stays with this alcoholic boyfriend because she doesn't have to work/work hard to pay bills (she usually goes from job to job - currently she's a part time school bus driver) and he pays for everything. Well this Memorial Day weekend she spent the weekend at my brothers house (he has a family) and Sunday I stopped by my brothers for a late BBQ/dinner. He called me on my way over and warned me my mom was going to ask to move in. When I got there I was short with her and ended up leaving before she could flat out ask... But she did bring up how in the last 6-8 months it's gotten worse with her boyfriend and it's gotten physical. My brother and I both got mad at her because we feel as though she's trying to guilt us. I do believe it probably has gotten worse because the guy is psycho (if I know he's at the house I don't come over or leave, no one in the family wants to be around him, etc). But his alcoholism and anger is NOT a new thing. She tried saying the last 6-8 months have been worse and I questioned why she hasn't saved money or made an escape plan in the last 6-8 months to leave or even pressed charges. I do have an extra bedroom at my house, but in two weeks she won't even be working or have an income because schools out for the summer. I also believe she will just go back to her boyfriend anyways since this isn't the first time she left him "for good" in the last 15 years. 
The logical part of me knows I shouldn't feel guilty. She never even raised my brother or I, she's put an alcoholic abuser over her children, these aren't new issues going on (maybe just worse), she hasn't made a backup plan or escape plan which my brother and I feel like she should've been saving for if not the last year, then the last 5, 10, 15!!! Years. But at the same time even though she wasn't a good mom, and I just started to have a relationship with her this past year, I do feel guilty. 
She doesn't really have anywhere to go. My brother has a 2 bedroom house with 2 kids so it's already tight. My maternal grandpa already has my other aunt living with him. And my mothers two other sisters don't speak to her because last month she got drunk and physically attacked my cousin (a whole other story!). I live alone in a 3 bedroom/2.5 bath home, so I do have the space. Even though I'm not currently dating anyone, I worked hard for this my whole life and enjoy my privacy... Also a reason why I don't have a roommate. I have the space, but I value mine. 
So yeah it's hard to not feel guilty.

TL/DR: Am I wrong to tell mom she can't live with me because she's (supposedly) leaving her alcoholic abusvie boyfriend, has no money, and nowhere to go? How to not feel guilty?
It's tough because it's family but if this was a friend you wouldn't think twice about your decision. You don't owe her anything, she's made her bed so she can either lie in it or as you say, come up with some escape plan and you can perhaps help her with that. 
So she can leave him for a few nights and the. They make up and both insist on living there. No. She has made no plan. If she feels threatened she needs to file charges and get to a woman's shelter. Don't put yourself in danger for a woman who has never put you first.
It can be a tough pill to swallow, but no. Don't feel guilty. You have to look out for number one since she clearly hasn't her entire life. 

If it helps ease your mind, think of it as enabling her if you allow her to move in. She's nearly 60, has been bouncing around and taking advantage of jobs - and it sounds like people, at least her boyfriend - for a large portion of her life. If you allow her to move in it will enable her to continue to take advantage of people. If she needs help finding a home or leaving you can assist her - connect her with heartly house, find some local services, etc. But you are not a halfway house. 
Firstly, I'd like to dedicate this post to all users in this sub who are veterans or have family members that are veterans, no matter where you are in the world. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your service.

Secondly, just a musing on something I've had on my mind recently. We are fast approaching the time when there will be no more living veterans of World War II left. Although all I've come across are too humble to admit it, they are, as Tom Brokaw said, "the greatest generation any society has ever produced." 

Please, if you are fortunate enough to have one of these great people in your family, try and learn all you can from them, and honor them while they are here. 

Happy Memorial Day, and God bless.


TL;DR:my mother is dying and I'm helpless.

My Mum has dementia, it's taken its toll on her and it's gotten bad, she doesn't remember who I am anymore and can barely move. She has been admitted into hospital and she isn't going to make it out again. My birth father died when I was 23 and she met her new husband a few years after. He looked after her when the dementia showed up, he stuck by her the whole time.

My Mum was there for me when my wife died and she looked after my 9 month old daughter while I grieved. But now I can't help her. I've lost so much and whenever it seems like there's hope it gets taken away. I lost my Dad then my wife and now my Mum. I can't see her without crying, she is blank and just asks why I'm upset. I don't know how I'm going to tell my daughter(14) she loves her nan and doesn't know how serious it is.

I'm with my Mum now by her side she's sleeping. My step fathers daughter from a previous marriage (my step sister) is at my home with my daughter. I just want my mum to be back for a few minutes so I can say how much I love her and that I couldn't ask for a better mum.


Update: she's gone
I'm so very sorry for your loss. Dementia is a terrible illness and has robbed many elderly people of their minds. I'm not sure if you're religious or not, but in my own faith I would say that she's doing very well right now. She definitely sounds like a very kind soul.

As for coping mechanisms, what I suggest is this: collect every photograph of her and your family that you can. If she has any old ones, preserve them in a very nice photo album. Not only is this a good way of honoring her, it will allow you and your family to relive happy memories and heal from your loss. I am planning a similar photo album in order to compile my grandmother's old photographs, and have amassed a few tips on how to do so, so please PM me if you decide to start this project. 

Also, try to remember stories that she told you throughout your life. Write them down, so you can share them with your own children. Make sure she is never forgotten. Take her lessons to heart each and every day.

I wish you well. Please don't hesitate to message me if there's anything you ever want to get off your chest.



It is always sad to see people pass away. We would love our people to remain as they were when all things are well. But time goes by and things change. I have built myself a conforting thinking mechanism that if a person reaches a certain age they have lived a "full life". I would suggest you to spend as much time as possible with your mother. Make sure you say everything you wish to say and do not regret anything. And if you ever regret not saying something...well they most likely knew already.

Edit: sorry for your loss. But she will always live in you. She gave you to this world.
I am so sorrt for your loss and all you have been through. How do you get by? Take one day at a time. Take things one task at a time. Grieve. Cry, yell, laugh, or whatever you need to do. You have lost so much and you are still standing. You have had to adapt and you will. Give it time. You will get there.
Thank you for the kind words. I might just take you up on the offer.
I didn't get to speak to her again. She woke up before she passed. She opened her eyes and smiled, then she closed them and went limp. I got home early this morning. My step sister was on the sofa with my daughter curled up next to her asleep. She looked at me hopefully, I just shook my head. She got up and gave me a hug saying she's sorry and that she is only a phonecall away, then she went home.

I sat down next to my daughter and she woke up, I told her and then she cried in my arms until she fell asleep and me soon after. I woke up this morning she was still asleep next to me I put a blanket over her and phoned work to tell them I wont be in this week. My step sister came round to check up on us earlier and she left not long ago.
My daughter is the only thing that keeps me going. She is my world. She is the only blood relative I have left and if I was to lose her I wouldn't want to live anymore. I would do anything to protect my baby girl.
I understand. I have two kids and they are my world. Make sure to take care of you too. It is easy to neglect yourself. You deserve to be well too.
My daughter comes first. This is the first time she has lost anyone (she doesn't remember her mum she was only 9 months old when my wife passed away)
Hi everyone - I'd love your help! My 90 year old Granny is currently in second place to win her life's dream - to get her entire family of 60 together for her 90th birthday party this summer! If you could help her out, please vote for her entry - by Peg K. titled "A Family of 60". Thanks so much! This will make her so so happy, when she's dealing with a lot of health issues.

I am a 21 y.o. guy who will be graduating in Computer Engineering next year. I come from a great area, love College, loved high school, had a great childhood, have the best friends in the world, and am very optimistic for my future. All through my teenage years, I recall being perpetually irritated with my mother. Our relationship has always been fine, but as I have gotten older and moved on to College, the same feelings arise every time I see her. Everything she says, does, and believe just frustrates and/or bothers me. She is a wonderful woman and mother, and I almost can't stand her. I just want to know why, if I'm the problem, and how to proceed going forward.

Background: My family situation has always been unusual. I am a sperm donor kid, and an only child, and have basically grown up with just my Mom. Thankfully this knowledge was never hidden from me, I had fantastic grandparents and all my family very close, and a family friend who has basically been my dad. The sperm donor thing is something I am 100% against, and I resented that and not having a biological father around more when I was younger, but it has never been a huge issue. My mom was a lawyer and we always did fine financially, however shit hit the fan when I started high school. Due to heart issues, she stopped working when I was in 8th grade, and my grandparents basically helped support me (and her) until they died a couple years back. I was extremely self conscious about all of this since I lived in a predominantly upper-middle-class and wealthy area, and felt like I didn't quite fit in or measure up (embarrassed to have friends over). Again, not my mom's fault. When my grandparents got sick, my mom had to be the one to take care of them (Aunt couldn't do to disability) all of the time. After they died, my mom got into a bunch of bullshit (IMO) fights with the rest of my family, and now they don't even speak or spend holidays together. This has gotten to the point where I feel like I am isolated from the entire rest of my family. Whenever I try to mediate or talk sense into my mom, I get accused of "siding with them" or having no sense of loyalty. I just want to have my family back, and it's hard to maintain those relationships when my mom won't even speak to some of them. My mom also has a ton of issues. Her whole side of the family struggled with extreme obesity and overeating, I know for a fact she struggles with depression, and is so emotional about stuff that it borders on irrationality...all of which bother me for assorted reasons. All of this was worsened by the death of my grandparents in the past few years (while I was in school, so thankfully I didn't have to be at home much). After a huge blow-up with my cousin shortly after the deaths, I spoke to my cousin on the phone and basically got a report that my mother was "losing touch on reality" and "had serious issues." I honestly couldn't argue with it. More recently, I got a call from my uncle who was concerned she was going to commit suicide (with her at the time, no issues). My mother, growing up, was always overprotective; wouldn't let me go to certain movies, took my out of school during the health talk (what the fuck?), never brought up sex or anything, etc. I have always been extremely independent, made good choices, did extremely well in school, and have had wonderful relationships! I've formed my own opinions, threw most of the religious sex/dating propaganda out the window, figured out what I really believed, and have turned out just fine (I was never rebellious or anything, just grew up). However, things blew up when I was at home last summer and got lectured and chewed out for simply having my girlfriend physically in my room (I basically burst my mom's bubble by telling her I didn't share her 50's etiquette about dating and didn't care about her opinions...thank god she doesn't know we have sex). Needless to say, dating at home has prepared me very well for preventing getting walked in on by college roommates. When it came to religion, my mom never really went to church or talked about anything in the house, so of course I never got "brainwashed" (I want to discover religion for myself, not because "my parents taught me this"). However, since I went away to school, she has basically transformed from a non-practicing believer into a some huge religious aficionado (like honestly believes the earth is 6000 years old crazy)...every conversation ends of being about some bible story, angels, etc. I identify as a christian, but it is a bit much for me. Also, I don't exactly line up with her hard-core conservative values either, which is also one of the only things she talks about. 

Summary: I don't relate to or agree with my mother's far right, super religious values which makes conversation insufferable and living at home unbearable. She is on bad terms with the entire rest of my family, while I'm not. She has a bunch of physical and almost positively mental health issues. Her personality is extremely emotional and at times irrational, while I am the opposite. Finally, I am literally the only human being she has left, and her entire world basically revolved around me. At times I sincerely wish she hated me and didn't want to speak to me. It's suffocating, it's draining to be around, and honestly I just want to move away and not deal with her issues and drama. I feel like I can't even move away and have my own life after college because of her. Am I just a terrible person?

The older you get the more you discover you're parents aren't infallible. Sounds like your relationship with her is in a transitionary period where you can write her off completely, coddle and preserve her idea of you as her special little guy, or try and establish your independence while acknowledging that it's a tough time for her as well. 
Aside from her being a lawyer and only having one child your mom sounds very similar to mine. It took me awhile to get to a place where I could empathize with her. I thought she was alienating her family and myself because she was inflexible and depressed. Over the course of several years and conversations I told her as much while she  gave me her perspective. 
She may prove to be implacable but she deserves your understanding or at least an attempt and even though she's getting old she still has capacity for change. 
You'll get older too and your perspective will change as well. Good luck.  
Thank you for your thoughts.
Two years ago I lost my wife and 5 year old daughter in a car accident. It was a head on collision and the driver of the other car also died I was the only survivor. I grieved for a long time and was homeless because I couldn't face going back to an empty house without my family. I quit my job and tried to kill myself at one point but I was taken to the hospital and put on watch. 

Since then I have got another home and have fixed myself up, but I have met this woman who we will call sophie and she cares about me and I care about her. But whenever we are together it doesn't feel right. I remember my wife and my daughter and I break down. It's all coming back and I can't handle it. She doesn't know about my family and I don't know if I should tell her I am thinking of telling her that I can't stay with her, and moving somewhere remote in the country, but I can't think straight and don't know what I should do.
I'm sorry for your loss. Don't isolate yourself you need to move on they are your family and always will be. But I'm sure your wife would want you to be happy. Tell sophie about your family if she cares for you then she will understand and help you through it.
I am so sorry for your loss. Two years ago is still fairly recent. You nevwr get over a loss like this, but you do learn to keep going. It is hard because you love your family and moving on can feel like you are being disloyal to them. You aren't. You deserve to keep going and be happy. Survivor's guilt is hard. You may also have PTSD, but only a medical professional can acess that. I recommend therapy. It can help. I lost my child to a genetic disorder and it took a year in therapy to get to a healthy place again. Let Sophie know what is happening. It is okay to heal. It doesn't mean you love them any less. Be well, friend. If you ever need to talk, I am here any time.
I don't think it is time. Surely if I still can't think past my family, I havn't moved on.
Thank you for your help. I will try therapy and see if it helps. It can't make it worse
You are never going to forget them and that's not a bad thing. But don't spend the rest of your life grieving you need to talk to someone about it whether it's sophie or a therapist. Don't be afraid to ask for help
Hang in there. I know it is difficult, but you will get through this.
I told sophie about my family, she said it wasn't right what she was doing and she said she had to go. I've tried contacting her but she isn't replying to texts and isn't answering phonecalls. I don't know what i've done to deserve this.
You don't deserve this. It is a lot to deal with. She may not be equipped to handle it. I am so sorry. 
I feel like I've lost them all over again. I just want to hold my baby girl one more time and see my wifes smile once more. I miss them so much.
Of course you do! That is very normal. The love you have for them will always be a part of you. Hold onto that love. It is okay to muss them.
I went on a walk to clear my head and I saw a little girl with her mother. They were talking and I had to go back everything reminds me of them. I just want it to end I don't have a life without them they were everything to me and I have no one else. No one can fill the gap they left.
I am so sorry you are hurting so much. No one can fill the gap they left, but you can keep going. Really. A therapist can help. This is a huge life event and it is going to take time to full cope with.
I can't bring myself to do it. If i go i will leave them behind I can't do it
Grief is a lonely place. You aren't alone. My heart aches for you because I know what it feels like to be drowning in hurt. It is hard to describe what it is like when you make it to the other side. It seems impossible, but you will get there.
Going to therapy won't be motivating you to leave them behind but on the contrary, with them staying right where they are in your heart and soul, inspire you to rediscover life. Good luck. 
I pray you're right
Me(19) and my mother(55) never got along great. Once I turned 16 she said get a job you have to start paying for your food. I already pay for my phone my car and my insurance. Then once I graduated high school and turned 18 she got upset that she was loosing her child support money and "needed" it. We live with my grandparents and she dose help around the house and help pay bills. Me and her haven't been on the same page in years. 

She has recently found a boyfriend who is the most serious person she's dated since her last husband. They seem to be great together but when they are apart she says mean things to him because he is involved in his children's lives and helps them any means necessary, driving to school or taking the family on a vacation. 

Here's where I need help. She has texted him on my phone as me. I caught her and made her stop. But recently about a month later I find in an email that she had been emailing him as me. She emails him and says how she's a strong women(I don't think so) she's loving and caring(hasn't shown it in years) makes up stories about how "great of a mother she is" 

I don't know how to approach the situation. She will say I was looking threw her things and snooping(I was because I was suspicious) and she's my mother and She can do what I want as long as I live at my grandparents. I don't think she has a healthy relationship with this man but she is happier and it's nice to have her out of the house. 


TL;DR My mother is emailing her boyfriend impersonating me, praising herself and occasionally bashing the boyfriend. 
:o

That is ... dang, OP, I'm sorry. That is pathological.

Since you pay for your phone, can you kill that phone and get a new number on a new device and not let her know about it...?
See if you can have a chat with him about this. She sounds like she is an exteme narcissist.
I think you just need to take a step back and think about why she I doing these things. Clearly your mom is insecure in her relationship. She sees herself as a bad mother and compensates with these emails. I think deep down your mom feels bad for the way she has treated you, especially when she sees her bf as such a caring parent.

I'm not saying what she did is ok, it's not but there are reasons why people do what they do and clearly there is a reason here. Sounds like we wants her bf to think she's s good person, maybe she'll turn into one. It sounds like your mother hasn't had the best life, maybe she just needs something in her life worth changing for. I wouldn't make too big a deal about it, just get her to stop making up these emails and actually do things together. 

Take a positive approach!
My sister is turning 33 this year, and I am turning 22 this year, and I can't take her anymore. We don't live together at all, but still, sometimes there is this time where we have to gather, and I am not allowed to skip any family gatherings just because my sister would be there too.

She has always stalked, bullied, and belittled me since I was born. She also always told me what to do and she often also got really offended from my jokes. She also got really offended one time when I mentioned that I can't trust going alone to one place because SOME (notice: NOT ALL, BUT SOME) immigrants didn't seem so safe. She immediately said that what I just said was racist. Well, no, as I wasn't saying that all immigrants are bad, I said SOME of them. She often sounds like a SJW.

She also hasn't vaccinated her own child and I am very worried about her daughter, and few days ago she belittled me for no reason in front of her daughter. Clearly seems like she wants to teach her daughter to be a stuck up diva to others for fun.

What can I do? I am never allowed to never meet her, and at the same time I am forced to listen to her paleo antivaxx SJW stuff. And when I try to help her and when I tell her what's true or not, she says that I am forcing her and she immediately defends the hoaxes by claiming that it's freedom of opinion. It is not, what she's believing and doing is insane and makes no sense.

She believes that soy and grains (and some other edible fruits and veggies) are poisonous plants naturally, when they clearly aren't. And she preaches that same nonsense to everyone. She believes and preaches so many nonsense that I have no time to put a list of everything what she says. 
Honestly, let her believe what she wants. As for the harassment, respectfully tell her that you dislike it and that it makes you feel like you should not attend family events. If she still continues, talk to your family about it and tell them that you feel uncomfortable and if you can choose to opt out of family events.
You say you have to go to the family gatherings. Why? If she is too much drama, skip the events. If you do go, ignkre her. Don't give her the satisfaction of a reaction.
because although I am almost 22 and I don't live with my family anymore, I am still forced into stuff. They say that if I skip the gatherings, then _____ will happen, or I will not get ______, or they will tell ________.

Why would they do this to a 21yo person? Gosh. 
You need to make a decision about what you want. You are still your own person. If you are on your own you should be able to opt out. It takes a backbone and it isn't easy, but it is what needs to happenm they will make it harder on you before they except that you are going to do your own thing.

3 times now, i've been on a date with my girlfriend, and her stupid mom will text her or call her asking to buy mcdonalds for her on the way home. And because i'm the one who's driving, its like she's using me. 

I find it so rude that she imposes herself on our dates. Is she too lazy to feed her own family? What is wrong with her?

How can I tell her no, and never again?

EDIT: BTW, the gf's mom has a car and is fully capable of going out to get dinner
I guess it depends on how involved you are with her family and how close you are with your girlfriend. If you're really close and you still insist that the mom goes to buy her own fast food, you should talk to her in person really nicely and say that you have to drop the plans you already have to buy her burgers. If you aren't close however, just tell your girlfriend that you aren't going to let her mom impose herself on your dates, and don't take the time to go to mcdonalds, because it's really weird and inconsiderate 
Has it occurred to you that her mom calls to make sure her daughter is okay, and the fast food is just an excuse?  I hate to admit this but if I had a daughter old enough to date, I'd check on her. LOL  

If you've been dating for more than a few months, though, and she's still calling, that is annoying.  Here's what you do -- stop at McDonald's on the way to pick up your girlfriend.  When you hand her mother the food smile and say, "I knew you'd want some so I thought I'd bring it now instead of later."   Don't criticize, don't be snarky or sarcastic, just be pleasant, and maybe a little teasingly amused, understand?  *THEN* if she calls while you're out on your date you'll have a legitimate gripe, and can ask your girlfriend to speak to her mom about butting in on your time with her.
Having dealt with a girls mother, who "liked" me, but felt I was completely wrong for her daughter, I have some advice.

My Wife's mother was always nice, but finally broke down at our wedding, letting out a lot of pent up feelings, about me and how I wasn't good enough for her daughter.


My advice is, deal with it. Unless the demands get unreasonable. As another user posted, maybe this is her way of checking in.

For the record, me and my MIL are on really good terms now, she's fully accepted me, and has told my wife how wrong she was. It was just a journey to get there.

Respect the person who could one day be your mother in law.
I am an intelligent, healthy person with a good career, but I have had bad anxiety and incredibly low self-esteem.

Although I never blame anyone in my life for my problems I have started to wonder whether my past might contribute to my current problems.

As a kid I was very sensitive. My Dad would sometimes purposefully make fun of me until I cried. Once I cried he would have achieved his result and would laugh at it. I hated this and went to my room angry (and still being laughed at) but it was only a handful of times and I ignored it. My mum was there and did nothing either way.

More regularly if my grades weren't good he would flip into a rage, screaming in my face, storming around the house and not speaking to the family for days. I dreaded that. My mum never really did anything. She wouldn't pick sides.

I hated school but couldn't talk to them about it.

However apart from that family life was decent. I had things I liked bought for me, I was taken to events and friend's parties and so on. They tried to do the right things. We took holidays and my dad could be very kind in his own way. My mother was very loving if uncommunicative and in some ways my Dad was the coolest Dad who could be very encouraging and I was fascinated by what he did and taught me.

So my question is what do you make of this? My family are still around and I am thinking of bringing up the bad things to see if I can feel better about life. I can be very tactful so it should be OK but even so I am still worried they may react badly to having the spotlight shone on them and it will worsen out relationships. They have previously become very defensive when I have brought up the past.

Should I just leave the past buried - even when I have clear signs that I may not have dealt with these things well?

What they did was wrong, but you likely won't get an apology. I would ask yourself a few questions. What do you hope to acheive from bringing this up? How likely are you are you to get what you are looking for? Will this male your relationship with your parents better, worse, ot stay the same? Hopefully, that will help you decide. Best if luck.
It doesn't sound like you're holding a grudge *per se*, but I would advise you not to bring up these issues with them if your relationship is currently good.

Forgiveness is a very powerful thing. If you can find it in yourself to completely forgive your parents for their actions towards you in the past and try to get even closer to them, I can guarantee you won't regret it. 

Also, remember that parent is perfect. My father threatened to burn our house down around my mother and I if we didn't leave (during their divorce) and wanted little to do with me or my half-brothers for years afterwards. Around 10 years ago, he made a positive change in his life and behavior, and since then, we have been great friends. I did miss out on the "father-son" relationship, but I fortunately had other positive male role models during my formative years. That your own father was able to teach you valuable lessons is a blessing.

Your childhood experience may indeed be the cause of your anxiety and low self-esteem, but confronting your parents with this will not change either of those things in the slightest. These are things that have to be ironed out slowly with new habits and preferably with the help of a professional/support group (not saying you couldn't go it alone, but having other people does help some).

I promise I'm not bullshitting you on any of this. This just happened to be a subject that I've had many years of experience with myself and thought I would reach out. Please, feel free to PM me if there's anything else you'd like to talk about.


Take care!
This is not a case of "I hate my stepmom and don't want my dad to be with anyone so I can't support the wedding." This is my dad's third marriage and I am an adult with my own life, no longer living at home etc. I'm happy he has found someone to make him happy particularly after his last marriage ended poorly. I do not necessarily like the woman but this is not the reason I don't want to go to the wedding.

The wedding is in Europe as his new wife is European. I say new wife because they actually got married last year in a small impromptu ceremony which I attended even though it required last minute travel plans. This year's wedding is intended for her friends and family for the most part, since they were unable to make the last minute ceremony last year. The European wedding is in a few weeks.

I don't want to go for two main reasons. First, I happen to be between jobs and have several weeks that I can travel unencumbered - an opportunity I have not yet had in life. I have been to Europe several times and really would like to spend the next few weeks somewhere else. The wedding cuts into my available time, such that if I were to attend, I would be rushing to take my personal trip (would pretty much have to leave within two days) and would not get to spend as much time traveling on my own as I would like before I would need to get to Europe for the wedding.

The second reason I do not want to go is mainly finances. Going to Europe is significantly more expensive than the trip I want to take on my own. While I technically have money saved up that I can use for this, it is a LOT of money for a few days and I'm not exactly rolling in money. Further, my father rented a large house for various friends and family to come stay, and without getting in to too much detail, the way the finances were divided seems pretty unfair/unequal to me. If I went to the wedding, I wouldn't want to stay somewhere else on my own, because everyone is staying in this house together and it would be strange for me not to -- but I don't agree with how things were divided and every time I think about it I feel very angry/taken advantage of.

These are the main reasons I don't want to go, although there are others and some complicated history. On the other hand, I worry I would feel guilty not going or would regret it later. Basically I'm choosing between going and possibly feeling resentful that I compromised my trip and my money, or not going and possibly feeling regretful that I missed a trip to Europe with my dad. I never committed to going, I have just been saying I would try to go if things worked out with my new job. But, going seems like a crazy herculean effort to attempt to be there for my dad -- a pattern I have repeated a few too many times at my own expense. I kind of want to be selfish, but I feel myself pulled to continue to act as I always have.

I'm consumed by this and truly can't decide what to do. :/
You already went to this wedding once. You are not obligated to go again. I would tell your dad that you already went to his first wedding and this is not a good time for you financially. He is going to pusj back, especially if you are going to be traveling in Europe around the same time. If your dad is unreasonable, expect pushback. He will guilt you and get upset. It is not unreasonable to say no. It is pretrt ridiculous he rented a house and expects you to pay a portion of it. It sounds expensive and if you have a destination wedding and you aren't footing the bill for people to travel you have to expect people to say no.
You already attended a destination wedding  for the couple. Send a heartfelt card and thoughtful gift. And enjoy your own, affordable adventure. 

If he has a hard time accepting it, well he is responsible for his own feelings. Hopefully he will recognize all you have done, and enjoy the time with the other guests. 
Honestly, not going is completely reasonable. Just sit them down take them through the above. It seems like you're making it bigger then it has to be. 
My parent has been married for long time even before I was born. We were family of 4 with me and my sister. They got divorce 2 years ago because me and my mom asked my grandparents and found out that he has a secret family with 3 kids.

 He had been a father figure and like an idol for me for the past years. He started the secret family 16 years ago. I was about 10 back then. He sent me to study abroad when i was 16 and later I became an immigrant.

 Now I m financially stable and live outside the country. I went back to the country earlier, he ask me to have dinner with him and my mom. He pretends to be nice and only later he says he want to visit me and my mom and stay at our house. This make me mad and we had quite a quarrel because i dont want to see him around in my new home, a truly comfortable home after all these years of his lies. During the quarrel, he became a person that i never know, more like a stranger. Then i realize that he kept wearing mask on his face even since when i was young or as a kid. He was being nice to us when i was young only because he thinks that is a bit guilty to me and my mom. But after i ve been studying abroad, he feels less and less guilty. And he just like a tyrant saying something like "you are my son and you should obey everything that i said. I like to stay at your house because i m your father and you should obey and let me stay". Of course he uses much foul words including insulting me as such. I just walk away with my mom after he says such thing.

After that, i travel back. And i m here. I know i hate him very much to a point that even seeing his pictures or anything with cause me pain and i feel i was being stupid all these years to think he is my idol, a good father as such. I cannot distinguish that if he had love me or my family after he got his secret family. I know i shouldnt hate him because it will cause me more pain. That is why i want to ask you guys if u had ever forgetting any family members? So that next time i see him, i wont feel more pain and be indifferent to him... i wanna know how can i forget such person...?? 
Forgetting isn't the answer. Holding on to the pain and hatred only hurts you. Cut contact with him. Live your life. Don't waste your time thinking about him. I know it is easier said than done, but give it time.
*bump 

We are in the same situation where I feel like my dad is a stranger to me after few incidents happened, it's really heart breaking. Hope that others can help you out. 
Hi Reddit I'm 17, and this takes place in Canada by the way. My dad left my mom with someone else about nearly two years ago. My mom and him had been together for 17 years but were unwed. He lives in another country but pays for the house we live in and helps pay partially for my school. There is however some strong holding going on about university. If I don't do what he likes he wont pay. My mom isn't very well financially. She is struggling to save for retirement now. She is speaking to a lawyer, and they told her he does owe compensation even if they are unwed. Is this true? Has someone ever been in a similar situation? Thanks for the help
Even if your father is legally obligated to pay, it could take years to sort it out. You can't rely on him to pay it. You need to play for you financial future as if he isn't going to pay. This way, if he helps you it will be a pleasant surprise. If he doesn't help you then you will be taken care of. Lots of people have to take loans out. 
Why not just get a job and pay for college that way? 
Your parents owe you nothing in terms of university, period. You're not entitled to anything as an adult.

He does owe compensation, but it sounds like he's (at least mostly) already paying it.
I have a part time job right now but working it off would take a long time
actually I checked out some laws and it does look like parents are expected to at least help their kid pay for uni http://www.familylawhelp.ca/who-pays-tuition/
The amount is based on their income and such
That's pretty messed up.
For starters I'm a 19 year old dude and my sister is 17. She's dating a guy who is 20 but is lying about being my sister's age so my parents don't freak out.
My sister tells me her secret and yadda yadda I promise not to tell my parents and it's fine. I trust her, and it's not a huge age difference.
Only problem is turns out I HATE the guy. Possibly the worst person I've ever met. I'm not even the judgemental type but to watch him sociopathically lie in front my parents almost gleefully is repulsive and I can't take it any longer. 
Not that it matters be he's also super right wing and awful to be around. I get extremely uncomfortable around him.

I don't know whether to let it go and just try to live with something that will likely only be temporary, or tell my parents his real age and lose my sister's trust. My sister already doesn't have a whole lot of respect for me and I'd really like to keep *our* relationship intact. Having a talk with her about my feelings about this would *not* go down well. 

I think you need to think about what telling your parents will accomplish. Do you think they will really be able to put an end to this relationship or will she find a way to keep seeing him behind your parent's back? You don't have to like the guy. The more you push the more she is going to be attracted to him. My sister stayed with a really scummy guy for years because we all told her what a dirt bag he was. Don't pretend to like him. Be honest and call him out when he does something in front of you. But always let it be her decision.
You''re right, if I ever want her to truly respect me I shouldn't attempt to interfere. It's difficult, but this was more of a rant than anything. 
I'll likely avoid him moreso than call him out, but it's not a huge difference. I'm pretty he gets the idea that most of my family dislikes him. 
I understand completely. It sucks. I wish there were a better solution. If you ever want to vent, message me any time. My sister went through this phase too. She and I are mucj closer since she somewhat passed it. I say somewjat because she married someone who is not a bad guy, but does have lots of issues thar can make it hard to like him. In the end, I just accept it was her choice and am there ti support her when she has issues. She does better when she realizes things for herself.
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind. 
I'm 24 and my mom is turning 65 tomorrow. I've always been aware that my parents were older than that of people my own age but it hasn't hit me as hard as when my mom turned 65 and my dad 66. I know that 60s is not an "old" age and that they are in good health but it somehow really depresses me that they're turning 65 and 66. My mom is my best friend...we spend the majority of our days together. I can't imagine life without her. And now for some reason, I'm thinking about her mortality. I don't want to. Why is it that I didn't really think about it when she turned 60 or 64? Why is it that I can't come to terms with her turning 65? I feel so depressed about it.
I completely understand how you feel. I am a 35 year old female with a father who's about to turn 80 and a mother that's 76. It's hard having older parents. You have to deal with things sooner than you'd like. Just make sure you spend the time with them that you can. Don't put off anything with your parents, tell them you love them and appreciate them. We unfortunately have less time with our parents than the average person. So take nothing for granted. Love them like crazy.
We never really know when it's our parents "time". Just keep doing what you're doing. Everything happens for a reason. Memories will last forever, people wont. This is coming from a 20 something that just lost their mother who was only 51... 
How you deal with mortality is one of the big shapers of who you are as a person. Losing parents, friends, (hopefully never for you but it happens) children... these things are a part of life. Nobody is here forever.

Best I can tell you is to appreciate the time you have with the people you care about, make the effort to bridge the gaps of time and distance with those who matter to you, and live in the moment: it will be gone sooner than you like, even if it's 3 decades from now. And those happy memories will stay with you, even when they hurt to recall.
It ia always hard to deal with mortality. It hits everyone differently. Be therr for them and enjoy your time with them. Nothing is promised. It is okay to feel sad thinking about living wirhout them. Just don't get so wrapped up in what could happen that you forget to live your life today.
The first anti-aging drugs are due out in less than 3 years, extreme longevity drugs out in 7-10yrs, and 12-15yrs max we'll have the first full age reversal therapies on the market.  Basically, if they can make it 5 more years their chances of living indefinitely are pretty good.  Most will not believe this is going to happen, but I research this field almost all day and most have no idea what is about to happen.

Interesting. Might you be able to share any sources for those timelines, please?
Have you ever apologized to a family member knowing full well you were not in the wrong?

I recently offered a no holds bar apology to my brother only to have that family member act as if I was showing my belly and then he went and presented my apology to other family members to validate his side/promote the myth that I lie an exaggerate.

I'm not sure if apologizing was wise, I was trying to offer an olive branch and now I'm being beaten with it.

Any advice?
It's hard to hear because it's frustrating but this says more about him than it does about you. Anybody who really knows you will know that you don't lie and exaggerate and if they're willing to take your brothers word rather than form their own opinions then you don't need them. If he wants to flaunt your apology, don't let it get to you, just distance yourself and maybe when he matures a little you can step back in.
Sometimes all you can do is walk away. You tried to be the bigger person and that says a lot about you. Some people are toxic.
Yeah, I personally would go up to your local grocery store and shoot it up with a sawed off. Just a suggestion tho
Me and my Mum are practically best friends, and we do everything together. Most of the time it's absolutely lovely, but I often worry that we're spending too much time with each other. 

She's been in an abusive relationship for the past 45 years, so I think she has trouble hanging out with other people and engaging in hobbies etc. She's very popular because she used to be highly proactive within the community, but despite having lots of 'friends', she never does anything with them. I've tried to suggest that she asks them to go for a pot of tea together or something, but I honestly think that she's scared. I've been trying to help her become more confident and I go out with her every day so that she doesn't feel bored or lonely. I'm hoping that one day, she'd be able to do these sort of things with other people closer to her own age.

She doesn't seem to put any importance on her own happiness or freedom - I'm ill so she's basically my carer, and she spends most of her time and energy helping me and doesn't consider the fact that she needs to look after herself too. I wake up late, so she spends her mornings simply waiting for me to wake up, and ends up feeling frustrated. She knows all about local groups and courses etc, but although I encourage her to get out and meet new people, she just doesn't take the initiative to go out and do something new. I'm 24 and spend most of my time with her - helping her around the house and keeping her company, but I feel like if she had some other people to hang out with, I'd have more time to go out and make more friends myself etc.

I've been trying to think of potential hobbies for her, and local activities that she might enjoy. We live in a relatively small town so there isn't much to do around here. She's 61 and quite active, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

Thank you! 😊
She needs to see a therapist because she can't rely on you for everything. That isn't healthy for either of you. As for hobbies, I knit. It is great.
Knitting, gardening, book club. Possibilities are endless! 
Crocheting or knitting! I'm an admin for a crochet group on Facebook and there's lots of friendly people just like her on our page. 
Journaling. Scrapbooking. Meet Ups for women her age. Volunteer at places. I recently got a Betta fish, it's become a pretty fun hobby getting tank conditions just so an it gives me a hobby to talk about (I have trouble relating to people and conversing usually) and there's even a Betta sub. Out here we have Colorado Free University which is just different short courses anyone can take, maybe you have something similar where you are. Quilting. Book club. Knitting club. One of those language learning sites where you Skype converse with people to practice. Find furniture at Goodwill and repurpose it, maybe sell it at craft fairs or use it to connect with other crafters. Maybe help facilitate these things at first since she's reluctant. I forced my mom to get a part time job at Target to socialize and it worked wonderfully. 
Is she comfortable with how she looks? Is she overweight, going bald, losing teeth?  Often this will keep people from being social, especially if people are accustomed to seeing her a certain way.  I would try Bingo.
Happiness is a two year old using a remote control car for the first time. 
This upcoming summer I’ll be moving back to NYC to live with my parents once I graduate from college. I have more opportunities back home, and I would also like to begin saving up to buy my own home in the future. 

My parent’s house is a two-family home and the second floor is rented out to relatives, who have basically lived there my entire life (since I was 3 and I’m now 21). They’re not directly related to us, but they’re family of family so we’re always invited to the same family functions and we’re close to them. In addition, the tenant’s daughter is a year older than I am and she’s become a sister to me. 

When I told my parents I’ll be moving back in, they told me they would like me to take the second floor apartment instead. They want the tenants out for a handful of reasons: they pay half of the value of the apartment and are often a few months behind with rent. My parents also intend on retiring soon and want to renovate the apartment before they do, so they can offer it to me, and then my younger brother when he finishes college. I should also mention the tenants aren’t on a lease, so there shouldn't be any issues regarding court. They’re going to give them a year to move out, so by summer 2018 they can begin renovations.

Lately the idea of kicking them out so I can move in has been making me uncomfortable. I know it’s not the only reason, but it’s the main reason they’ll be using. I don’t want this to put a strain on the relationship I have with a best friend I grew up with, or for it to feel awkward at family events. I also know they struggle a lot finically and and won’t be able to find a place remotely close to what they have right now in NYC. It shouldn’t be my concern but because I’m close to them I can’t help but to constantly think about it. I also know at most I would use the apartment for two years before I move out. So..

TL;DR- Is it a bad idea to kick out close family and then move in immediately after? Should I ask my parent’s not to use me as their excuse for kicking the tenants out?
If they aren't paying and keeping up their end of the agreement, then this is on them. 
Your parents have been more than generous with this family for many years and have given them a years (unheard of in renting) notice to find a new place. You should not feel bad,  this family has been behind on rent etc. for years and is probably a source of stress for your parents.  Renovating for you is a perfectly valid excuse to finally move on to a better situation for your whole family. If the family gives you or your parents a hard time, they are ungrateful, entitled jerks who should be thankful for having had such a good environment to raise their daughter in.  It's time for them to take responsibility for themselves.  Enjoy the new space!
A little back story that me and my brother were talking about last week over beers.

I was the only person that wasn't invited to our cousin's wedding. He did it on purpose because he was always jealous of me growing up for multiple reasons that are all childish.

My immediate family didn't attend and some other aunts, uncles and cousins didn't either to support me. In fact the only cousin that went felt obligated and left right after giving the bare minimum.

So me and my brother were talking about how much of an asshole the cousin was and because of it we decided to cut him off completely. He is now dead to us! Harsh I know but that cousin needs a reality check.

I started talking about when I get married I would do the exact same thing he did... You know.. An eye for an eye. However my brother thinks I should invite him to make him look bad for ever inviting me and also mess with his brain. We think he wouldn't even go anyways.

What would you do? or What did you do when a family member didn't invite you?

No wrong answer. Just looking what the average person would do.
Be classy - if someone is petty to you, don't be petty back. 
send an invitation and then send a second envelope out with http://i.imgur.com/rgSjW0c.jpg in it 
[deleted]
If you habe cut hin out, don't invite him. You don't want a spiteful, jealous at your wedding. If you burry the hatchet before then, sure. If not, best to avoid it.
sure, I'm a better person
What if I just ignore said person.  Is that considered petty?  There's no contact at all between me and him.
It would make me look really bad. Would rather not send one at all.
Its family stuff.  I wouldn't have gone anyways but if the tables were turned; my mom would have ripped me a new one if I didn't invite him if I got married first. His mom didn't do the same to him about not inviting me...

Since I wasn't invited first; my mom doesn't give a shit if I don't invite him to mine at all.
Will never burry the hatchet with this degenerate. He crossed the line long ago.

But basically I was thinking about how I should give him an "un-vitiation"
I guess it depends. If you're inviting all other family, just invite him too. 

However you do it - be classy and mature about it.

[deleted]
Don't acknowledge him or do anything. No need to be petty. Just don't invite him.
No my mom has high morals especially with family and wanted me to invite him but since he didn't invite me and he caused all this bullshit with our family (I left that part out) she doesn't give a fuck anymore and supports me with not inviting him.

Only if I would have been getting married first and I didn't want to invite him she would guilt trip me into inviting him.
One of the reasons why I liked my "no invite" rule.  Theres no BS involved and its to the point.
Exactly. 
A little background info, my (22m) younger brother (19m) didn't grow up together. My parents split up just after he was born, and my father moved states with him. I only saw him in person about once every 5 or so years. We were even less than cousins and had nothing to do with each other. Before a year ago the closest we were were Facebook friends and that's it.

So just over a year ago, my brother came to live with my mom and I. Verrrry~ long depressing story as to why; rather not talk about it.

From the very start of him living with us he's made me feel intimidated. For starters he's physically taller and muscular than me. Personality wise, he's a bully. He very quickly took on the role of "man of the house" and mom seems to admire this. He treats me with absolutely no respect. I myself have social anxiety issues so having an alpha brother doesn't help. Naturally my mother takes his side because she rarely gets to see him.

My mom absolutely ADORES his muscular body and constantly tells me to "beef up" like my brother. While at the gym my brother and his new 'jock' friends constantly ridicule me for my skinny frame. One of his friends (who I had never met before in my life) had me in a headlock while my brother filmed me. Mom just says they were just "being boys", taking his side as usual.

Last month while my mom was away with work colleagues for a few days, it was just my brother and I. I did my best to help around and my brother treated me like dirt. He had his group of friends come over that night. I stayed in my room keeping out of their way. Even through headphones I could hear them all yelling insults at me. 

Then my door flew open and my brother was there, looking scarily aggressive at me. He grabbed me and pulled me downstairs to where his friends were. He pinned me to the wall as his friends humiliated me. My brother "proudly" lifted his shirt up showing me his abs as an insult to mine. I can honestly say this was the worst night of my life.

It hasn't been much better since either. He often brings his girlfriend over (who's about 15 years older than him) and I hear them together. I'm aware this is pure jealousy on my part but I feel he overdoes it.

I'm saving money to move out. It's gonna take forever to move out, but in the meantime how can I cope being around him and even my mom? I feel like i'm unwanted in my own home.
Your brother sounds like an asshole. There is little to do if your mom won't do anything. It sounds like he seeks you out. Other than spending as much time away from home.
Your brother is a colossal asshole. This is not ok. 

Put visine in his drinks. Buy a colony of ants and let them loose in his room. Um, rub habaneros on the bottle of lube in his dresser drawer. Create a fake Facebook account of a woman and message your brother's girlfriend saying that he's been cheating on her with you for months.

Or just buy some pepper spray and next time he tries to assault you mace him in the face and call the cops. 
Sounds like a asshole bro.  I know it is hard, but take what he says with a grain of salt. Fuck that dude.  You keep doing you and focusing on good things!!! 
your brother sounds like a dick. if you really want to build your confidence up, join a martial arts club. added bonus is that if he tries shit then you can defend yourself
Sorry to hear that mate. Patience is key. Keep your eyes on the prize and focus on what you like.

If being around them is toxic, then find a way out.
I am no expert, and I cannot rule out the chance (based on your post history) that this is some sort of weird fantasy, but if this is real, it sounds like you are being abused. For your information, nobody has the right to abuse you. Nobody has the right to humiliate or belittle you and disrupt your emotional peace in your own home. I would suggest doing more than moving out.

For starters (based on the other subreddit that you posted this as well as what you said here), if you at any point have strong reasons to believe that the two are engaged in an incestuous relationship, you can actually report them to the police, and normally they should take it from there (unless you live in some freak country where laws permit adult incest). Also, if their abuse results in any physical evidence (i.e. bruising, or videos of them abusing you), then I'm pretty sure you can go to the police with that stuff as well.

But the most important thing (IMHO) is for you to find and seek help from centers/organizations against sibling/parental abuse or domestic violence in your country. You don't need to suffer broken bones to qualify for help from them. At worst, they might say they aren't eligible to assist you, in which case you can just ask them to redirect you to somebody else who can (although judging by your description, this is definitely not going to happen).

This needs to stop. And I don't mean to sound rude to the other commenters here, but "damn bro, sucks that your brother's an asshole, you just keep your chin up" doesn't help in these situations. You can't keep your chin up if somebody keeps beating it down. Since you clearly have unrestricted internet access, I would (preferably through incognito browsing) look into this further. Try to find forums or websites that specialize in this matter, as you will probably get even better advice from there, and after that you can consider contacting someone who can take direct action against this. Good luck.
Seems like he's trying really hard to prove that he's better than you, possibly because he doesn't believe it himself. He's probably jealous that he never gets to see his mom but you do, so he feels like he has something to prove. Or maybe you have some other trait he envys. I don't think he would go out of his way to be an asshole to you just for the sake of being one.

Wow, that is a lot of questions and the percent bar did not move for me so I gave up on the third page.
I like "lots of questions" and meaningful surveys.... Why _heterosexual only_ participants, though? Aren't bi- or pansexuals good for this? What about homosexuals? 

Why? 
Yeah, it is a lot of questions, but the aim is to provide the best research as possible. You should be able to return to the survey at any time to finish it! If not, I really appreciate your time! Cheers!
Great question, and thanks for taking the time to ask! I answered a similar question seen below:

Tl;dr: To simply answer you question, you are right. By excluding single and/or gay fathers, I am limiting the ability of this study to speak to the experiences of singe and/or gay fathers. And you are also right that I am not separating how the age of a dad can influence how men engage with their children, because there are differences. However, this study is just the first step out of many.

With a more detailed answer, the filter is due to a balancing act between making sure the study is open enough to have enough participants and being specific enough that the study can be generalized to certain fathers.

I would love to allow more dads, such as single and/or gay men, to participate in the study. This would let me recruit more people to be part of the research and allow the research results to the experiences of single and/or gay fathers. However, I'm limited by the resources I have to recruit more dads. If they paid graduate students to do the research, I would totally make this study big! But, sadly, that's not true. So, I have to limit the study to a certain number of people.

Now say I had to limit the number of people to 100 fathers. If I limited the study to White, heterosexual, married, 30-40 years of age with one toddler man, that's a very specific group which I may not be able to recruit enough people. However, if I did get my number of people, that means results that I find can be generalized to a certain extent to that specific population. Now, if I opened up the study to include more dads (say single and/or gay men) without changing the 100 cap, the results are less generalizable. That's because I have say 25 single hetero dads, 25 single gay dads, 25 gay married dads, and 25 hetero married dads. Now, I can potentially speak to similarities between the four groups, but there is no guarantee that what is found can be applied to certain dads. Throw in other things (income, age, when they are married, race, etc) and then this becomes not doable.... unless I had a lot of money.

I hope I was able to answer your question! Please feel free to ask me to clarify if something did not make sense!
Hey, thanks for taking time for posting so elaborate answer to their question (sorry, I didn't notice that). 

I did specifically asked about bi- and pan- because they are, at some point of the spectrum, attracted to females as well, so they could be intended target group of your study, just accidentally left out - I am not sure if that matters because I didn't check all the questions yet. 

Thanks for the answer. Take care and success! 
But then why go out of your way to say things like Spouse and Significant other instead of just Wife?  Also, why the two questions at the end asking which sex you identify with and your sexual preference?

Also, I disagree with your premise that including gay men will cause too much work.  You can limit the sample size to the level of work that you can handle.  If you can only handle the answers for 100 men, why should it matter if all of them are heterosexual and say a 80/20 split?
I agree with you completely, and it definitely does matter! It makes me think of whether different sexual orientations can result in differences in how people respond to the items of the survey. It will be a limitation of the study without a doubt! Thank you for bring it up!
I answered your first paragraph in another comment!

With your second question, this gets more at statistical methods. Forgive me if you already know this: The main issue is statistical power. Do I have enough participants to generalize the findings to this certain demographic when I try to examine all these different factors? The more factors I use, the more people I need. If I don't have enough people, this can result in what is called Type 2 error (false negative). This means that what should be a significant result becomes not significant for the population I am trying to generalize my findings to. So simply having only 80 individuals when I need more for x amount of factors will result in results that are misleading. At the same time, having only 20 individuals for x amount of factors will also be misleading. The ideal would be to extrapolate the sample size to, say, 400/100. That would be amazing! But then, this gets at the later point about resources to conduct the study.

My brother just gave birth to his first son with his wife. Because the wife is the last in her family line, she hasn't changed her last name and they decided that the child's last name will also be the mother's last name. 

Since then my mother has been furious (she was never happy with the wife not taking my brother's last name) to the point where she is calling the child a bastard, saying that he will not be considered part of her family and that my brother should change his last name, essentially ostracizing him from the family also. At this point our family is just me, my brother and my mom as my father has passed away and we have no real relationship with extended family. 

To me this sounds like some straight shit from medieval times. A couple friends I know have done the same thing and their parents still love and accept every thing. I know it is a very rare thing to have a child take the mother's last name, but the reasons for doing so appear to be universal. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this, or more importantly, have any sort of advice or ideas as to how I can talk my mom down out of this belief structure of hers.
Your mother is being ridiculous and if my mother acted that way she would never ever see my kids.
Screw her! Neither my husband nor I changed our last names when we got married, and my daughter has my last name. So what! 
If you're up for some snark, why don't you try something like, "At least she's got a name to be proud of, Mrs. 'I must have changed my last name out of shame'."
That reminds me of something my mom would do and she is extremely toxic. I'm slowly but surely cutting her out of my life.
most likely I can see my brother and his wife doing this, and I'm on their side for it. I'm not really inclined to let her see my kids if/when I have them. I really don't want to expose them to this kind of tolerance... then again maybe it'll be good for them to see what intolerance looks like first hand.

Holidays are going to be more nuts now. 
She said that she asked everyone she knew and that no one had ever heard of doing such a thing. The fact that a good friend of mine whose parents are also friends with my parents did the same thing proved that to be false. When I reminded my mom about him, she asked if his mom was truly ok with it (she is) and then called his kid a bastard too. talk about stubborn and really unreasonable.
hahahaha I did say "Yeah cause out of all the Patels out there, we are so special" .. she didn't really like that :D
My paternal grandfather passed away. The same weekend that his funeral was scheduled, my cousin (who's addicted to narcotics) had planned to go to a weekend retreat for addiction help. The funeral service still proceeded that weekend but my uncles decided to delay the body burial until the following weekend so my cousin could come for the burial. Due to this inconvenience, a lot of family out of town will not be able to attend both weekends and will miss one or the other event. My uncles thought it was important for my cousin to get the help he needs, so they rearranged the funeral schedule to accommodate him.

My father is furious at his brothers because they made this schedule without consulting him, and feels that by rearranging the funeral schedule to accommodate an addict, that they are enabling my cousin's addiction. 

My uncles do not feel that it is enabling him because my cousin is trying to get better by going to the meetings, so they want to help that happen. 

Setting aside the messed up aspect of delaying his burial and delaying everyone's closure:

Is this an example of enabling or helping? Just need neutral opinion. 
Enabling isn't the right word. This kid is trying to get help, not go on a drug binge. I don't think it is right for your uncle to move the services. Life goes on while people are in rehab. Your uncle probably doesn't want to make things worse for his kid. He is beteren a rock and a hard place and it doesn't seem like the rest of you would have been accomadating. I don't know if it was the right call, but I understand it.
I apologize about the wall of text in advance. 

Anyway, I've always had a rocky relationship with my dad growing up but as I'm 26 now and was living on my own, i hoped that he would have forgotten about the issues we had with each other. I was living on my own and had a full time job but then my company lost some big clients and took advantage of me. Long story short, One of the HR people would have been in trouble for forgetting to send me important information while i was on vacation and essentially forced me to quit so that she could get away with it. unfortunately i had no proof of this conversation as it was not in writing and i was refused to speak with my supervisor. basically they laid me off without having to pay unemployment benefits. Now I needed to find a new job and i had already spent a lot of my savings on the vacation just a week earlier. So my parents offered to let me move in to find work. I was hesitant to do so initially because of the history between me and my dad but they promised they would give us space and only wanted to help so i hoped that he may have changed since i last lived with them in college. 

All I have ever wanted was to make him proud and to earn his love and respect but for some reason any time I try to talk to him or bond with him, something just feels off. as if he is wearing a mask and not letting his true thoughts and feelings come through. He has spent his whole life climbing the corporate ladder and now he is an executive and has had a lot of success doing that. I want to say he a millionaire now but he keeps that extremely secret from anyone, including his kids. because of his corporate lifestyle, he has always treated his family like a buisness; he talks to us like we are his employees. Almost every conversation we have with him is turned into some sort of lecture and is often about jobs, careers, and how to be a good employee. Then things he talks about that isn't about the workplace such as being a vegetarian is drilled into us as if we are doing life wrong. He can be very demeaning and has a passive aggressive way of using facts and statistics to "say nothing you say or believe is correct and if you don't start listening to what i think is right", I wont respect you. 

All I've ever wanted was his respect and love so I do what he tells me to do, I apply for the jobs he wants me to apply for even though I know I wont be happy there, or I start changing my eating habits because he may be disappointed that I had a steak the other night. and when you want to show love towards him and just have a genuine son-father relationship with him, his laughs don't feel genuine or he doesn't pay attention; lost in his mind about his business.

Today I feel like i got a taste of his true colors but i don't know if he was just saying mean things out of anger or if they were genuine. I got a bit annoyed about him always indirectly telling me how I should become a vegetarian. Don't get me wrong, I respect vegetarians and the vegetarian culture for many of the good reasons people choose to be vegetarians, but the way he constantly indirectly lectures me on why my lifestyle and food i enjoy to eat is wrong can get a little annoying. So I let him know that i felt it was annoying. then he went on to say again indirectly that he talks about being a vegetarian around other people and it's annoying to him when someone is bothered by it. then i shut up and thoguht maybe he was right and realized i may have been too paranoid about it and shouldnt have said anything. so i said i apologized if i was annoying and felt pretty stupid for ever opening my mouth. I then said i needed some time alone and just wanted to be by myself for a while because i felt pretty ashamed for making a big deal about something so stupid. 

I went to my room and he then started screaming and cursing and calling me things like "a fucking thin-skinned piece of shit" "I dont respect fucking assholes like you" and told me that he didn't feel sorry for me and instead he "resents me". When i tell him I wasn't trying to attack him or make him feel bad when i apologized for possibly being annoying and wanting to have some time to myself" he just tells me "that's bullshit". I am worried that when he blows up like this, there is some truth to what he says and that he really does resent me. 

I have tried so hard for years to have a good relationship with him, to do things he would be proud of, and to show him I care what he thinks about me. But now I'm worried after all this, maybe i can never earn the respect and love I've tried so hard to earn. 

What's wrong here? I admit, I am too soft. People tell me I am overly nice and let others walk over me. And I admit I can be a bit ignorant about how to do a lot of simple things in life. So is there something you think I can improve on to fix this broken relationship? All I want is to make him proud and get the love i have always wanted from him. But no matter how hard I try his smiles don't seem genuine like he is wearing a mask to cover up this "resentment" he has. 

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice on this issue? Thanks in advance. 
The problem is with your father, not you. He is rigid and unchanging. He sounds controling and egotistical. You can't fix this because he is the problem. Live your life your own way. Apply for jobs that make you happy as you will be doing them, not your father. If you like eating meat then eat meat. You aren't doing anything wrong. If you keep living your life to make him happy you are going to wnd up being miserable. Be your own person. He will always have his own opinion and that doesn't matter if you are happy.
You're not "too soft;" your dad is a jerk.

Think of it this way. Parents sometimes, mistakenly, view their children as extensions of themselves, rather than as individuals. It sounds like his anger isn't even really about you. It's about him feeling like a failure because you don't want to be 100% mini dad. Or him feeling like when you fail (temporarily lose your job, move home), that is basically a reflection of him as a failure. 

Short of becoming more successful in business than him, there's nothing you can do. And even then, you could never let him know how successful you were or he'd berate you for talking about money, since he doesn't like doing that. 

The thing you can do to heal this for you is to be a better partner and a better father than him. It won't fix your relationship with your dad, but you'll feel better breaking the cycle. That may be all you can do. Worth it. 

Target, Walmart, Old-Navy, or Resale mostly. 
Anything under age 2 or so, try to find garage sale, last kid parents, or church/school/goodwill sponsored resales.

they rarely wear anything out before age 2.
And still, always ask around, if folks are on their last kid, they often WANT to get rid of the clothing.
Summer garage sales , lots of picking through but you can find high quality, barely worn. 

Buy offseason retail stores. End of winter at Kohls, Target etc. -winter jackets $12 instead of $48, winter boots $6 instead of $18, but for those you really have to be on the ball, right time, right day.

Also, when my grandsons were littler I used to buy 'lots' of gently worn clothing for them on eBay.
You learn to shop carefully, for name brands and fair shipping.
Limeapple has some really cute toddler clothing - minky bubble hoodies, legging sets and swimsuits!
Same here. There's no point in buying quality items because the clothes are going to get stained and then outgrown fairly quickly. Old Navy has half price sales a lot and often has good deals on clearance, especially pajamas. Walmart is great for inexpensive pants, and Target has cheap, cute t-shirts. Plus, we buy used close at garage sales or those kid themed resale events - those are great for suits/fancy clothes and like-new shoes that some other kid only wore once or twice. 
I've been living on my own for almost a year now. Due to my parents living less than an hour away, I sleep over their house once a week to visit. I'm 26 years old. 

Is this normal? Part of me says I should stop sleeping over once a week because I'm an adult in my late twenties. But then the other part says that if I'm fortunate enough to be able to see my family once a week, take the opportunity because they're not going to be around forever. 

I have a lot of concern because I'm also going to be moving in with my girlfriend in a couple of months, and I'm afraid that she's going to judge me if I want to go sleep over my parent's once a week. They don't live close enough where I can just go for dinner and then come back to my place. 

So back to the main question, do you think visiting my family once a week is a bit too much? Should my girlfriend approve of this when we move in together? 
If your parents truly are less than *an hour* away, I would consider that close enough for a short visit not necessitating sleeping over. That's me personally, though. I live 2.5 hours from my parents and see them maybe every other month, probably less though. Sometimes I stay over, sometimes I don't.

But the real issue is, it doesn't really matter if your girlfriend "approves" of this. It's your family and it's what you want to do and it makes you happy, so why would it matter? As long as your relationship with your family is healthy (which, you haven't said anything to make us think it's not), there's no issue. Even if she DID think it were weird, if she loves you she wouldn't say anything to make you feel bad about it.

Why don't you have your parents up to visit every other week, and you go see them every other week? Then you're sleeping over there less and you can see how you feel about it.
It's wonderful that you're so close with your family! If they're only an hour away you can definitely go just for a meal and then go back. I also live 1,5 hours from my parents, and before I met my SO I always stayed over when I visited (about every other week). But after I started dating my SO I  really preferred to sleep in the same bed as him, so if he couldn't come along to my parents I would go back home. Now that we've been dating a little longer I have stayed over by myself, and it has been nice to experience "the old days" again that way. Not too often though, as I still prefer snuggling up to my SO. But anyway, none of that matters, it's about what *you* want! You'll find out what you want once the two of you live together. If you'd still like to sleep over at your parents house once a week I really don't see why you shouldn't. Just talk about it with your SO!

I am sorry you worry so much about being weird, especially at 26. Did anything happen for you to start worrying?   
My parents live 2 hours away. I visit them twice a month for a weekend, but I have eldery grandparents and my parents also want to see the kids.
It's up to you and your parents to decide how often to see each other.  If all parties are happy then go for it. However, if you live together with your girlfriend it seems indeed weird to sleep over with them every week. Unless she also goes away.
It's up to you, of course. My parents live one hour away. I see them maybe once a month, and never sleep over. 
This is some kind of rant mixed with a need for help, anyway I just feel like I'm against the wall, a year ago I didn't feel happy in the university I was at, so I transferred and I feel really happy with my decision, but the problem is that I had to move to another city which is two hours by bus from my boyfriend's current city. First we made plans of when I would go visit him and vice versa, until he told his mother who thankfully (irony here) told his father, who threw a literal tantrum about him getting a bus and coming to see me, we're both twenty years old and my parents are also not happy about this situation, my mother said that he should be the one coming to see me and that he'll lose his girlfriend, my father thinks it's weird since I've been living on my own since I got into college (I was eighteen) and that he should grow some balls, and now I have his father saying that he'll have nightmares if his son step one foot in the city, (I live in a big city, it doesn't matter where I'm from in the moment). I'm a college student (obviously) so I'm always on a budget specially now that bus tickets are expensive, if he comes here he has a place to stay since I have my own place, there I have to stay with his parents and his dad has not been the most nice person after I transferred. Breaking up is not an option here, but I feel like he's (my boyfriend) not making an effort either, he just took his dad words as law, and both of my parents are pressuring me to do something, I don't wanna pressure him because his dad is emotionally unstable and I feel like I would make it into another problem, has anyone gone through something similar or has any advice? people near me say that he'll lose me at some point because I'll probably meet more people, and I'm also about to be broke because I'm majoring architecture and have to buy materials that are not cheap , also I'm living alone which means: bills everywhere, sorry about this huge rant but  I don't know what to do.
You need to decide if it is worth putting in so much time,  money, and effort for someone who doesn't return the favor. It's a two way street. I would flat out tell him you can't afford to go see him and you are not going to stay somewhere you are not welcome. He is free to visit you, but he has to come to you this time. You, at the least, need to alternate. 

If he is too afraid to break away from his parents, then it is going to be difficult. He needs to be his own person. If he can't, the relationship isn't going to work. It will only work if both people are putting in the effort.
You can find a way to make it work if you guys are both very honest with your parents about how you feel. It sounds like everybody wants what's best for everybody. While you're still young, you are 20, and it's time for your parents to hear you to make a mature decision.  I think once they hear this they will be OK with anything that you and your boyfriend choose.  
Does he live at home?  
Yeah with his parents 
I'm 22 with minor autism, depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies.
For example I walk downstairs first thing in the morning and she goes "soon as you know I'm in the kitchen you come in"  with a screwed up face. My "brother"(he's 16) adds to the issue.

Sorry for bad grammar I'm in a hurry for advice before I lose my temper.

I don't mean to be a pain, but I don't see the problem with this interaction.
You can't lose sight of everything being put in front of you for a reason. Even if it doesn't have a good outcome, the lesson or the wisdom gained IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL later
When it's nothing but negativity it gets to your head. I've tripped on LSD so many times for my mental health and I can never do it again near them due to fear of them giving me a bad trip.
Nope everyday is bad. I'm a young man let me say a bit about me I guess. I'm 22, autistic but I graduated with a law degree & have a plan in place to live with my Uncle and aunty in Canada (leaving the country for good). 
I understand, but please remember, all of us need to talk with someone sometimes. There are some brilliant people and great programs excited to help you in your struggles. And it's not because you have autism...its because everyone needs someone. We are only human. I included an article below that might put you on the right track.

https://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/2013/10/18/newly-diagnosed-adult-autism-seeks-therapy-advice
I'm not newly diagnosed. I was diagnosed as a kid you are born with it. & Therapy doesn't work. They use methods to make themselves look like God when they see a fault/weakness in a patient which every animal/human has emotionally & spiritually.

Positive I could find insecurities in every therapist and psychologist if I knew them personally.
Don't we all have insecurities...we are all human...all flawed. I hope you find someone to connect with and learn how you might be able to deal with struggles
You could think of this as the ultimate form of revenge. You see, I wasn't happy with my childhood. I know a lot of people have had it worse than me, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I was unhappy and depressed with my family, life and childhood until I moved away at 19.

A little background on my parents:
My dad was raised at a farm and his parents had a carefree attitude to raising children. My dad and his siblings were pretty much free to do whatever they wanted. Personally I think this kind of parenting only works if your child is a good and timid person at heart. Since they lived at a farm they always had junk cars to work on, animals to play with and a lot of woods and lakes to explore, which are all things I would've loved to do as a child but couldn't. He was always interested in new technologies and was allowed to follow that passion freely. He has owned and built several radios, has a license that permits him to make his own radio broadcasts and such. Basically he was never put down or controlled by his parents.
My mother was raised in the suburbs of a small town (16000 people) and she had a controlling and overbearing mother.  I don't know much about my mum's father because he killed himself when she was just 10 or so. This turned my mum's mother for the worse. She shunned new technology and even refused to learn how to drive until she was in her late 30's.  My mum wasn't allowed to do almost anything without asking her, she wasn't allowed to leave the house without a good reason, she wasn't allowed to show "negative" emotions or speak back to her. She wasn't even allowed to wear earrings before she was 17 for fuck's sake. They never had any pets, seeing them as burden.

These things shaped the way both of them viewed parenting. When I was born, the idea was that they mix their upbringing to create "a perfect middle road". Unfortunately that didn't happen. This was because my dad is a very quiet and meek person. This coupled with my mum's explosive temper, assertiveness and "I know best and no one can prove otherwise" -attitude created a family where what she said was what happened - no exceptions. She always had to have the last word, she always had to be the one who decided what we did on our holidays, she was always the one who started every argument and she had to win every one. My interests and feelings were rarely considered. When I was 6 and a psychologist told my mum I need to be taken into further studies, she swept this information under the rug. (This wasn't about money. In my country mental health care is free. This was purely laziness and pride on her part.) Due to my undiagnosed psychosis coupled with Asperger's disorder, life didn't treat me well. I was always an outcast at school. I saw and sensed the world differently and this world has no mercy for people like that. I developed severe depression as a result. When I mustered up the courage and told her I'm depressed she only said "oh" and acted like I hadn't told her a thing. When the depression felt unbearable and I asked for her help, her usual response was to yell "then get help!" in a frustrated voice, like my mental health that affected everything I do and feel was just a nuisance. I didn't know where to get help. I didn't even know how to start. That's why I asked for her help. And every time I was shot down and treated like I had made it all up. 
When I left our family's religion (Christianity) and "came out" as an agnostic she ridiculed me and my lack of beliefs. She would always ask me questions like "If god isn't real then..." and whenever I answered to the best of my knowledge she made fun of me. Apart from her, no one in our family practices their religion or even believes in god, but I just happened to be her personal chew-toy.
She always nagged to me about how I don't have "enough" hobbies. She used to say "If you find something you like, of course I will support it financially", but what she meant was "As long I like your hobby I'll support you". None of my interests matched her idea of a "useful hobby" and thus I received no emotional or financial support. When I got into computers, she did her best to limit and control that. I had to pay for my own computer all by myself (which is reasonable) and when I finally got it she was always putting her own passwords on it, stealing my cables, yelling at me for being on it and having my dad periodically check the computer for porn or pirated media. When I showed interest in playing the guitar she refused to buy me one because "you couldn't play it anyway". When I showed interest in firearms she forbid me from going to the shooting range or hunting with my uncle because she simply didn't like it. When I showed interest in tinkering with and fixing cars she forbid me because "it's a waste of time". She was always pressuring me to perform better at school. "Just do your best and I'll be happy" she used to say, but in her head my best was straight A's. She refused to acknowledge that intelligence can be in fields other than school performance. 
I was always afraid of her. I never knew what would set her off. I rarely spoke anything to her because there was always a chance that she took anything out of context and lost her cool. Due to my Asperger's I have sensitive hearing. That made her screaming even worse. I have developed tinnitus in my ears and I truly believe her constant screaming was at least a partial reason for that. We stopped going on family trips because she always threw temper tantrums and blamed me and my 2 siblings for the ruined trip. One of my earliest memories is when she physically abused me for the first and (luckily) the only time. I was about 4 years old and I was playing outside. When I got inside she noticed that my gloves were wet from playing in the snow. This caused her to get mad and firmly grab my wrist and toss me hard on the floor while going on rants about everything I've done wrong. For a 4 year old, that was hard to experience. I've always stayed out of her arms' reach and never allowed her to hug me, and I believe it's because of this incident.
We never had any pets. I always asked for one because I absolutely love dogs, and with the depression I would've needed anything to give me emotional support. I always promised to be the one to feed, walk and love the dog, but every time she refused because "You're going to forget about the animal anyway and then I'll be the one to take care of that nuisance." She refused to believe I was capable of being responsible. She refused to believe I loved dogs, simply thinking that I see dogs as just some kind of toy that you buy and then just abandon after it gets boring. 
Remember when I said "I know best and no one can prove otherwise" -attitude? That extended to her view of our personalities as well. If she believed I made an honest mistake out of malice, then that was the truth and I was to be punished. The dog part above is a perfect example of this. 

It was only a few years ago when my mum began to acknowledge her mistakes. Her apologies are only in words, however. She still hasn't done anything FOR me, she only keeps talking about how sorry she is without actually trying to change. I asked for a guitar once again and she promised to get me one. It's been a month now and she hasn't said a single word about this promise or done anything to buy the fucking thing. I could buy one myself (and I probably have to) but I've waited this long because of the principle. She promised something to me and I want to see her fulfill that promise. Whenever we talk about my childhood she keeps crying and apologizing but never does anything to prove she truly meant what she said. The way things are now it seems she'll never be worthy of my forgiveness. I want to forgive her because I just don't have the energy to stay mad all the time but whenever I try to truly forgive her, I just start thinking about everything she's done wrong and can't bring myself to do it. The wounds haven't healed yet, not by a long shot.

^This story is why I'll give my kids the childhood they deserve, want and need. Of course there will be boundaries where they're needed, but for the most part I will do my best to be as relaxed and allowing as the kids' personality allows me. If they find a hobby they like, I'll support them. We will have pets in the house and I won't pressure them about school (unless they're failing on purpose). I won't sweep their possible mental health issues under the rug. I lived 15 years with an undiagnosed mental illness and that ruined me. That will not happen to my kids if I have a say in it. I will be an open-minded parent with whom my kids will have no trouble talking to. I won't ridicule them for their religious views or belittle them for their appearance.
I know parenting won't be as easily done as said, but I will do my best to be what my parents were not. And when they grow up to be whatever they want, that is the ultimate revenge. Showing my mother that she was wrong. Showing her that her way of doing things wasn't the best like she thought. A big middle finger to her entire philosophy. And then she'll spend the rest of her days knowing that she never had the family she dreamed of and it was mostly her fault.

I might come off as angry and purely revenge-driven, but I would raise my kids as well as I can anyway. It being a revenge is simply a huge benefit. And it's not like I'll screw my kids over just to make it not look like revenge. All I wanted as a child was to be happy, and when she refused to accept my poor mental health, she denied that happiness from me. Maybe I'm not a good person for wanting to do this instead of forgiving her, and if so then so be it. She took my childhood happiness away, I'll take her elderly happiness away. It's only fair.

I am sorry for all you have been through. It doesn't excuse what you mom did, but it sounds like mental health issues run in the family. Your grandfather committed sucide, your grandmother made your mom repress her emotions until she exploded, and never learned how to handle it. She was emotionally abused and she passed it down to you. It isn't right or fair, but it is what it is. 

Breaking that cycle is hard. You can do it! I believe you will. If you haven't gotten to a therapist, it is definitely worth trying. It is hard when you don't have the support of your family, but it is worth it.


What a difficult childhood you had. I believe you will try to be the wonderful parent you and all kids should have had. 
And if you don't have kids of your own please see if you can go and provide help to others. Together we can empower eachother and give eachother the support that our parents didnt or couldn't give us.
I've been to therapist, yeah. There were a lot of things I wanted to say but didn't want to make the post too long. One crucial thing I forgot to mention is that I can't sleep. My brain just wouldn't shut off. I would usually roll around in bed for hours before getting up and going to the computer (if I'm gonna stay up I might as well do something I like, right?) Whenever I got caught they thought I was up because I was on the computer, not the other way around. They refused to accept that I needed medication to sleep and thought I wasn't sleeping because I was "lazy"...

Mental health issues do run in the family. I'm psychotic, depressed and autistic. My younger brother has ADD. My youngest brother hasn't had anything diagnosed yet, but he is showing signs of ADD and is simply just plain weird. I see similar morbid and out-of-touch-with-reality thinking in him as I had at his age. The only one who seems normal is my sister, but she always got special treatment from mum. Not by much, but it was there. This probably due to my sister's gender. My mum has this very old school way of thinking that men and women have their "rightful places" and should be treated differently solely because of their gender. I think that's bullshit and a few arguments have stemmed from this. It's funny being in an argument about women's rights with a woman who thinks they shouldn't have any.
It is crazy. My mom isn't 100% the same way, but she doesn't understand that certain things will have consequences for women. I am 30 year old mom and have two daughters. I want the world for them. I can't imagine want to stiffle the wonderful people they are.

You are strong. You have a good handle on who you are and what you need. Lots of people lack introspection. You are not your mom. You saw you needed help and you got it. That takes a lot of strength. It is something to be proud of.
I've acquired this introspection only recently. Before that I spent 19 years wondering who I am and why do people treat me like a different person. Demanding things that aren't there while repressing things that are. I felt like a complete failure and wanted to die. The turning point in my life was realising that I don't owe anything to my mum and now she owes me. She owes me my childhood back. That can never be accomplished and I can only hope that the pain of knowing that will make her a better person. She still has one kid left to raise. She has one more chance to prove to me she's improved. If she hasn't, I'll cut her out of my life forever and I won't even feel bad about it because she brought it on herself. In my heart I want her to succeed but my brain tells me she won't. 
My ex wife abducted our American Children and took them to Canada. I filed for divorce and custody. The order said for her to put kids in school by certain date or return the kids. 

In the divorce she admitted no domestic violence. In Canada she claimed the opposite. She tricked me into moving back to Canada post divorce where we had joint legal custody and her primary physical. And it was at this point CAS took away my rights. 

Three years and my life savings later I got my rights back. Another year to force disclosure of the CAS records and I make startling discoveries. Firstly, they knew she falsified the kids applications for citizenships in Canada to circumvent the US order and secondly my ex admitted to them that she abducted the kids and they knowingly did not inform the authorities. 

The question is why...  

So far I know they colluded on 4 counts of citizenship fraud and I can prove based on case notes about them not reporting the abduction. Are they not also liable for profiting from the exploitation of children under human trafficking laws?

And now I enquired about getting my record expunged and everything they did was illegal. Example Having local Canadian cops interrogate my kids without consent, denied access to the consulate a lawyer or a parent 

Anyone have advice or comments?  Anyone else been through this?

I went back to US court and they won't give me the kids unless my ex is arrested. When I bring up all the proof the court tells me their hands are tied unless she is arrested. And most likely they won't charge a so called single mom. 

So here I stand as a dad who loves his kids. That is battling all of the lies and trying to rebuild a life with my kids. Sorry for the length and subject matter but advice would be appreciated 

Thanks!
I am so sorry this happened to you. Try /r/legaladvice. They will be more likely to be able to help.
how do I forward to this group?  Trying to figure out...
If all else fails, cut and paste.
paste what?
If you can't cross post (I am unsure how), you can copy what you wrote here and past it in the text box over at /r/legaladvice.
done
Best of luck. I truly hope they can help you and you can see your kids again soon.
I'm an only child and my parents are well off, life has been pretty good for me. My boyfriend has 3 siblings most of whom are in debt or still living at home (one is a 32 yo male at home). My boyfriend is also becoming successful and is on track to get paid for his PhD and I'll soon be graduating from veterinary school debt free. I can't help but feel this jealousy from his family when I visit. They really like me and are happy for us, but I just feel something in between us. 
They may be. If they're nice to you and polite, ignore it. If you bring it up it will embarrass them and cause them to be defensive. 
Some people refuse to honestly evaluate themselves. They don't realize someone else's failures are not their successes and someone else's sucesses are not their failures. They make excuses for why they can't acheive things and make all your success seem like blind luck. Ignore them. I would talk to your boyfriend about it. 
We have this in our lives too. We stopped talking about things except in generalities. No one knows (anymore) how much we make, no one knows how much we spend or what any of our big purchases are. When we talk work, it's, "Oh, it's going well. How about you?" Just focus on talking about them so they don't have any information to get jealous over. If they can't keep it in perspective and be happy, they don't get to know your personal stuff.
Okay, I'm not a saint, I've pretty much lost touch with my parents.  They didn't do anything wrong per day, they were just were too controlling.  They pushed me into uni and I didn't want to go, they tried to get me to break up with my boyfriend, and they hate the fact I do t live with them.  

I pretty much cut contact for a bit and I really want to get it back.  

The problem is they're so annoyed at me.  My mother went in for surgery a few weeks ago and she didn't tell me about it, but I happened to call that day.  I was going to go see her but never got around and it totally slipped my mind (I work and study full-time).  

I phoned today to apologise and obviously she went completely off at me.  Saying it was the nastiest and rudest thing I've ever done.  

What do I do to get their trust back/ rekindle the relationship.  She didn't sound too impressed and told me that my father was t happy with me at all.  

HELP!  
Go hang out with them again. It doesn't need to be for an event or anything. Kind of just show up, and sit around. They'll probably be sour, but if you take time out of your day (however many times a week or month you want to do it) and just be in their presence, it'll wear off. Like I bet showing up, saying hi with some coffees, and then plopping down on a chair to hang out for a bit would be cool. Look at your phone, etc. Make them see how comfortable you are around them. Let them trip about why you're coming around so much. Eventually you'll start talking about your days. Don't overshare your dreams for the future since it annoys you when they try to control you. Keep the conversation to what you are doing in the now. I'm sure they would love to have their kid coming around at their own free will because their kid loves them.
I am just very curious why all of a sudden you want to get back a relationship with your parents after you cut contact with them?
What made you change your mind?
Be consistent about caring about them and their lives.  Repairing a relationship isn't something with shortcuts that will yield lasting results.  You just have to be a good family member consistently.  Over time, the relationship will heal.

Doing things like blowing off your mom after finding out she was having surgery, will damage things more.  Just be a good son/daughter and keep it up for a few years.  They'll come around, but don't expect instant forgiveness.
Honestly, right now it sounds like emotions are a bit high. Perhaps write them a letter or email, apologize for not seeing your mother when she was in for surgery, explain that you want to live your life but want them to be part of it (if you do). 

But I have to ask, why the sudden change of heart on your part?
Hey everyone, wife (38f) and me (36m) are expecting our first baby in less than a month. We had a wonderful baby shower thrown by very good friends.

There's one thing that has my wife and I confused: her parents traveled here from Texas and didn't bring a gift. Not even a card wishing us well. 

We have a great relationship and they have told me they love me like a son, but this seems negligent on their part. Whats the etuquette on this?, because the gal that threw the shower didnt get us anything either...but I can see why since she probably bought all the food and drink and hosted etc. but the folks? Cmon...I suppose it doesnt help that my family was VERY generous to us. 

Now it may very well be that her folks thought their travel and mere presence a gift enough, but
honesty we need help right now. I felt hurt by their (non) action and I just talked to wife about it and she burst into tears.

How would you react to not getting so much as a card from your in laws/parents at your
baby shower? 
Without being critical, remember this is your first baby, and first time around at all this stuff.   Grandparents very often do not present a gift at a baby shower, these are intended more for friends and extended relatives.

Chances are her parents have a gift for you and/or baby when it arrives.  TWO things to bear in mind. Some people do not believe in gifting or buying baby items until child is born. It's kind of old fashioned but still exists.


Second. Her parents might Simply be waiting to see what you've received and what YOU STILL MIGHT NEED, so they can be as helpful as possible.

So I would react by thinking, whatever the In-Laws choose to do, my child will be so blessed to have two sets of loving grandparents. Lots of children do not have that benefit.
I understand why it may seem off. But traveling is expensive. They may have thought the gift was being able to show up. It doesn't mean they aren't excited to meet your child.
Thank you very, very much for the fair and detailed response.

And thanks for not calling us greedy
It exists here; most have a shower after the baby is born. 
Thank you, I was pretty sure I was correct in this In some religions and some cultures it's just considered 'bad luck' or just not done until baby has actually arrived.

thanks!
thanks so much!
yes, only first time parents. but thank you for your interest!

When I was in high school I went to get some camping gear out of my dad's truck and found condoms. I'd suspected he'd been cheating on mom so this was confirmation.

I never confronted him about it but I did tell my mother. She just looked at me with tears in her eyes and said "I know".

I've had a lot of problems with my father but I think that ended my desire to get to know or understand him at all. 
Yes, I would say my dad started but who knows. My dad used to go to strip clubs, party with women even when he had his wife. At first my parents ignored the fact that one was cheating and coming home drunk and fighting just to take my brothers out for family activities. With time it got worse and worse, so when it came my turn to hang out with my parents because I'm the youngest they where always not there, many times they made me feel like it was my fault they fought. How I coped with it?  I didn't! 

I always wanted to go fishing with my dad or to a baseball game, it never happened because he would rather spend his money in beer with his friends and women than with me as a kid. I had older brother but they didn't want to hang out with a 10 year old and my mom worked and had her parents sick so she left often. She started seeing another man and they fought more and more, it came a regular thing in my life. Now that I'm 21 I would say I have some what of PTSD, I'm afraid of dating because I think all relationships are ment to suck. Now my parents and brothers want to spend time with me, they want to go to baseball games with me but now I'm the one that doesn't want their company. I do almost everything alone, I learned to suffer and how to deal with my problems; from extremly low temperatures and snow storms from working in state parks in winter times to fighting fires in the hot summer for a forest service fire crews.

It is very hard for any kid to see his/her mother in helpless situations... 

Same is the situation with this topic..  When you know that your mother is in distress and your father is the reason...  How can one be normal with him or how can you even accept him as father... 

Is there any way to deal with it? 
You have gone through a lot buddy...  And you have stood for yourself to be what you are today..  I hope not all relationships be like that...  All you need to do is choose a perfect partner..  😊  

As a kid I also went through lots and lots of issues like emotional and physical abuse had to witness mom and dad quarrelling​ day in and out..  But when the time came for me to choose my life partner I made myself clear that all the shit I faced till then would never be in my life again and I found out what exactly I wanted..  All I wanted was a simple peaceful life..  I was ready to compromise on money completely I wanted a loving home..  I was ready to work hard no matter what for my future family..  All this made me arrive at the right conclusion while choosing my husband..  And today after 8 years of marriage I can say that I  did a great job !..  

Hope you find someone who can care for you and love you the same as you do... 😊 
Is it possible to love your husband/wife after 10 years being in marriage?
I have been with my husband for 14 years, married for 8. I not only still love him, I love him more and more every single day. I think there is no poaaible way to love him.more and then I do. I live seeing him interact with our kids. And laughing with friends. He is a good man. We have been through hell and back. The things we have been through would break up most couples. We lost friends far to young, family, and even our oldest daughter to trisomy 18 at six days old. But our bond is stronger than ever. We cling to each other. We are best friends. I am so lucky we met so young, I was 16 and he was 18, because we have a whole lifetime together. He is my other half and my soul mate.
You are really lucky! It is so nice to read such answer. Thank you.
 To give you a little background  my parents split up when I was very young and they don't talk pretty much at all. My dad from since I was little was very selfish, stingy, and petty. Nevertheless I was a kid and I still loved my dad. Then the joy know as child support came into the equation. This is where things changed, my mom has  always been independent of a man and been able to take care of her own due to her having a well paying and successful career, so I had a great childhood with her and she really is a great mom. My father on the other hand worked in a bank he made enough money. My mom didn't file for the money I believe but because he had money and never would spend a penny for his child or ask if any help was needed but proceeded to sneak around with multiple women and bring me around them at a age of 7 witch was weird. 

I remember going through child court because he didn't want to pay child support and tried everything to get out of it. From telling my mom false promises to saying she would never see him again if she filed for it. Fast forward and my mom lowered it (Which is crazy) so like the ass my dad is he proceeded to laugh at her when she did that and tell her "I have a girlfriend I'm out of here" my mom told me she almost had a panic attack when he said that. My moms always been very tough be idk she wears her heart on a sleeve when it came to him. 

Now theres a court order for me to go and see him which i resented even at the age of 7 and 8. We would go out and he wouldn't get food until he was hungry take me around with various women. Pick me up then on the corner he would pick up what ever woman he was sleeping with at the time and then tell me not to tell my mom which put stress on me because at that age I had to thing about the consequences of what saying something would mean I would be causing stress to my mom who went through enough already so I would keep my mouth shut. 

Now we move to another state and he follows and builds a house 30 minutes away from us. Im in middle school and me and him are cool no problems still not helping with anything not a light bill, shoes, clothes, nothing, but still showing me court documents like its a badge of honor and he should be proud. Now high school and I see how my dad is buys himself a nice new car 2 to be exact sill pays reduced child support. Now I'm at the age where I start driving( he didn't even teach me how to drive my mom did). He then like the moron he is brags about how he got his girlfriend a nice new Lexus to my face. This set me off in a rage I called him and cursed him out. He then told my mom he was going to whoop my ass. We didn't talk for 2 years. 

Now I'm about to graduate and my mom tells me I should make amends and invite him. Three days before graduation I do. I have a car at this point and don't really care for him at all. Past graduation I walk into his house and he tells me he had another kid who's like a year at this point and was really awkward when I walk in and see her.... Thats fine with me though im not the type of person to resent her or anything im always respectful and never bragged about anything I have to anyone. 

Things are all right sill weird between us and here comes the first of his great parenting skills we go to the movies it was in imax and cost like $36 and i get the tickets he's late like usual, and tells me he will pay me back lol. When he first saw me he should have given me the money but no...... movies done and he asks me to drive him to his car now were at his car sill nothing about the money so I bring it up he counts the cash and shorts me $5 and says "You want dad to pay the tolls to go home right" meanwhile he has an epass. 

Then for my birthday we eat at a restaurant which he tells me he writes it off as business expenses. We end up in best buy and I get something thats $40 and an gift card thats $20 and he tells me that he has to pay bills and that he's not getting the gift card. Keep in mind that I've never gotten a birthday card or gift or Christmas gift in 21 years. He also tells me how he pays child support and thats enough. Then I tell him you pay REDUCED child support and he still complains about child support.Im disgusted at this point so were still in the store and he proceeds to pick up a  router that cost $150 I'm in shock now and I asked him how morally he could get something that cost more than what I was going to get on my birthday he tells me "thats dads business". Now were at checkout with both items in my hand he tells me to put one back he's not getting both like im 5 years old in toys r us or something. I give him one and he pays for it so I checkout and get the other item (did he think I leave the house without any money?) and then the jackass has the nerve to tell me that I should've used his best buy points? 

Am I in the wrong or something or is my father that much of a lowlife? sry for the long post btw 
Thanks had to get this off my chest I was the original poster but forgot my password to my other account...smfh 
Dude both of our dads dont pay nothing.
Mines a doctor but doesnt pay a cent.
Your not overthinking it. 
He sounds like he isn't a very good father. 
As long as you weren't exaggerating, Scumbag. 
Father? I don't see that he cares for you at all. Sorry about your experience.
You should sue for child support. $20 says you'll never see him again.
I am 27 year old student. I came home from college for the holidays. Long story short, my mother has been going through a hard time mentally and told me to come home to support her. I live 2 hours away from college so I usually come and go every few days to check on my apartment and hang out with friends.

This past time I tried to leave, she took my car keys, my cash, my identification and told me I am unable to leave. I don't have money to get around and I don't have money for food. I am trying to get a friend to drive me back to my apartment in the next city however I will not have any of my bank cards or ID.

I told her I would call the police but she said the car is in her name so everything in it she owns.

Is this illegal? How should I go about this? 
Well, is it her car? She doesn't own everything in it, of course, and not your cash or ID, so she can't legally take that, but she can take her own car. 
Take a looksies at /r/raisedbynarcissists  -  If this sounds like your mom, we're a supportive community, don't hesitate to ask for advice 
She can take the car but not your ID & bank cards.

If you call the cops, it's highly likely it'll be deemed a civil matter, but could be worth trying. Just remember that if she's likely to flip out, cops don't have a good record handling unstable mentally ill people.

Could you wait for her to fall asleep and get everything back then?
The car is hers, but the cash and ID are not. Report that they have been stolen to the police. Get out of there asap. Don't go back to her place. If she threatens to hurt herself you can call the police and do a wellness check. She is not your responsibility.
So u need to call the police and also call to her her mental health 
Not sure where she's hidden them
Does she have weapons she's likely to use if you wake her up while looking...?

I mean, really, I'd seriously just wait for her to go to sleep and search in a grid of reducing likelihood if you'd be in no physical harm if caught.
I'm disgusted with my parents. They are both lazy under achievers with no friends. My mother  is constantly angry and bitter. She alienated all of our relatives on her side of the family. My father is weak willed. He capitulates to her on everything then talks shit about her behind her back. 

I'm living with them while in college (I'm 21F). Neither of them cook or clean. They are neglecting one of my brothers, who is 12. They don't feed him properly (they just get fast food or make him eat cereal or snacks) or play with him. He's a bright kid who learned how to feed himself and do well in school, but he deserves more structure and support from my parents than he's getting. Mom didn't get along with my other brother while he lived with us over his bad grades, even going so far as to choke, hit, and throw things at him. 

I can't stand them, I want to be as far away from them as possible. Listening to my fathers whiny reedy voice and seeing my mother lash out in rage over stupid things fills me with revulsion. 

Should I try to improve my relationship with them? No family is perfect, is it possible that I'm overreacting to their flaws? I don't want a better relationship with them (I want to be as far away from them as possible), but feel like I should want a better relationship. They've supported and provided for me all my life. Obviously it's better to be on good terms with your parents then on bad terms. My mother has had health problems for the past couple years which partially explains her anger (she's in constant chronic pain). My father isn't the aggressive/controlling parents so it seems wrong to be angry at him. Being on good terms with them would create some stability for my little brother. 

Something needs to be done. Up until now I've been trying o interact with them as little as possible, but am starting to sour on marriage, family, and relationships. All this resentment and disgust is making me insane. The question is, should I try to improve the family dynamics by spending more time with them (maybe having a board game night), or get away from them?




If they are neglectful and violent to your brother then he needs help. I know it is tough, but they either need to start going to family therapy or you need to report them to child lrotective services. If you don't want a relationship with them then that is your choice. It sounds like an unhealthy situation and I don't blame you for wanting out.
I'm so sorry this is your situation. It sounds really hard. I haven't lived it, but it reminds me of my husband's family. Things were always chaotic and his (much older) siblings struggle with addiction and anger problems. His strategy has been to distance himself mentally (I have no idea how, honestly) and find a small way that he can be part of the family without being too involved. His nephew was in a bad situation but is smart and driven. We've worked hard to keep contact with him and make sure he has what he needs. My husband encourages him to stay on track (he's about to finish high school) and he knows we have his back if he needs anything. Being a good influence for your brother is a big deal. And it sucks to have to be a "backup parent" to him but maybe that's an option?
Be there for your brother, which does not require you to be on good terms with your parents.  You have a separate relationship with your brother than with your parents, and you should handle it as such.  Honestly, I don't think you *owe* them a thing - a minute of your time and attention.   It was their choice to have children, not yours.  That's how this kind of thing works.  

I would wager that your mother has real issues beyond just the chronic pain - if she's alienated her own entire family and your parents have no friends of their own, then it's a pretty good sign they are seriously toxic of grade-A assholes, and both of those are things you want to get as far away from as possible.  Sounds like your dad is co-dependent.  
Good for you guys for helping out your nephew! When he's famous and successful and getting some sort of award I'm sure he'll thank you in his acceptance speech :)

As for your suggestion, I've kind of been acting as a backup parent to my brother already. I'm the one whose been doing the cooking and housework and I try to spend as much time with him as possible. It's hard though since I'm going to school full time and working part time. 

What it comes down to essentially is that it's BAD for ME to live there (it makes me physically sick, like stomach aches and sleeping problems, interferes with my studying, and I don't have time for a boyfriend or friends), but it's GOOD for MY FAMILY that I live there. 

Obviously, my brother needs support, but if things get to bad I won't be able to do housework or schoolwork and won't be any good to my brother (since I'll be just as sad and angry as my parents). So is the better to tough it out, or to come up with the money to move out and be a better/more emotionally stable "backup parent" that he doesn't see as much? I should add that nobody is being abused or is in immediate physical danger.


I figured it was something like that. You're between a rock and a hard place. I think you're the only one who can decide whether to move or not. My dad did something similar when he was younger--he moved nearby and still spent a lot of time back home doing things for the younger siblings, but he had his own space to go back to. Maybe it helped him keep from burning out. But you have to be able to afford it. If you're being run ragged at home, it's worth it. But I know you're in school and working full-time would make it harder. Both your options seem like that could work so maybe it depends on how much stress you think you can take at home. It's a bad situation, but you have choices. Keep your hope going. 
A few years ago my then wife and I moved our bedroom from right next to our daughter's room upstairs, to a bigger room on the main level. I felt nervous at first but figured we'd have more privacy. Sometime earlier this year however, she started creeping into our bed during the night. No big deal, I'd let her fall asleep and bring her back. It was a phase I assumed. But the marriage is coming to an end, our schedules are opposite but we still love together for now. I understand how my daughter feels now that she's coming to terms with changes up ahead, so I have been more lax about sharing the bed. But it worries me that during school nights, she's interrupting her sleep. BTW, I am planning on moving back with my parents after the house sells and she's had a room set up there since she was born. 
Instead of letting her fall asleep before taking her back, you need to walk her to her own room while she's still awake. 

Could try something like "Okay,  we can have quick cuddles in Daddy's bed, but sleeping is for your bed in your room" 
What we did to stop our kids sleeping with us, we started sleeping with them. We put a mattress on the floor next to their beds and stayed until they would fall asleep. It shifts the sleep deprivation from them to us. Slowly, they are becoming OK with us leaving after just 10 minutes. In the beginning, we often fell asleep before them, then had to get up again and go to sleep in our own bed.

Other option, just actually sleep in one room with the kids. Until their love batteries are sufficiently charged. Patience and love does it. Good luck.
To those that are grieving a parent first I want to say I am truly sorry for your loss and wish I could take your pain away as I wish I could do for my husband that lost his mother (my mother in law) at the beginning of this year 😞 I have a question. My father in law married to mum for 35 years has moved on really quick. Saying this they were close and did everything together. They were never apart. We found out 3 weeks after mum had passed he was in a relationship. He chose 6 months after to tell his boys and said nothing serious was going to happen after he came back from a month long holiday but with in less of 24 hours of him telling them she (the new girl) plastered it all over facebook. We hadn't even meet her yet. Getting over the shock of that we have seen her twice but even then she is very reserved. Even the first meeting she disappeared for a nap. Now almost coming up a year of mum passing he has told my hubby that he wants to get engaged to her. When my hubby told me this I said is he was crazy. It's your mother's 1st Anniversary of passing and you don't want that surrounding that. He has even asked my hubby if he wants the family portraits that have mum in them from the family home. I don't know what to do or say to my father in law as you can imagine we are quite hurt and gutted by the lack of respect mostly for the boys to be able to grieve for their mother. Any thoughts of how I can approach this with my father in law? We do want dad to be able to move on but the lack of respect for the boys losing their mother is very hard. Also I'm confused with the lack of respect from the new girl too as we know she lost her father back in 2003. Thanks in advance
Yes dad relied on mum for a lot and we fully understand his need to move on. The difficulty has been how he has dealt with it with boys. Thank you for you kind advice. I guess what we are hoping for is how we can include her into our lives with out been so mad at them both. Especially when she has made no effort to get to know us. Wether she likes it or not we are dad's baggage and we aren't going any where. He has grandchildren that want to be very much part of his life and dam it if I would allow her to get in the way of my child's relationship with her grandad. Also getting him to see it's not the kindest thing to propose to her on or around the Anniversary of mum's death. Thanks again 
Psychology classes have taught me two things about men who grieve a lost wife.  If they had a great relationship, and they were dependent on their spouse, they will seek out a relationship way sooner than a woman would because they miss the relationship and the support.  I don't know if this will make sense. But it's not like he got a divorce because he hated her.  He spent 35 years with her! It's natural for him to seek out "normalcy." And for him, that's being a husband and having a wife.  He isn't doing it to smear her memory, but to honor it in a way.

Now here is the thing-that leaves very little support for the boys.  He should have been more discreet and considered their feelings.  Are they all out of the house? Is he alone?  If so, he might not have thought it would hurt them (or certainly did it on purpose.)

I am so sorry for your loss.  Your husband no doubt needs you.  I wish there was an easy fix :(
Everyone grieves differently. If this is what he needs then he deserves to seek it out. It doesn't mean he didn't live your mother in law. It sounds like he loved her very much and he doesn't want to be alone. He hasn't beem alone in 35 years. The idea of being alone when he is hurting is probably even more scary to him. Maybe your mother in law told him to move on. I know if I died tomorrow I would want my husband to find someone new and be happy when he was ready for it. If he is happy and he is with someone nice, I wouldn't worry. He could juat be working through his grief in his own way.
Wow I guess by the responses I've been getting either I haven't wrote it right or people don't read what I'm asking or both. We want him to move on it's about how he has dealt with it with his grieving boys. Telling them on significant dates of mums death. Saying one thing but do the complete opposite eg like say not doing anything serious then have it plastered over facebook before they even have a chance to adjust. How do we include her when she hasn't made any effort to get to know the family. We love dad dearly and want him to be happy. Sorry I do appreciate your response.
Your story could have been my story 18 years ago.  The shock of finding out dad had moved on so quickly after mum's death.  Unfortunately my story didn't get any better as my father's wife hates us!  No matter how much I  try she will always put a barrier up to me and my sons.  She even made dad move to another country so we barely see him, and when we do see him or talk to him she gives him such a hard time over it that he's upset.  My advice is, no matter what, keep your relationship with your dad strong.  Don't say anything negative about her even if she is being a complete bitch.  He will always take her side if there is conflict so try your best not to cause any conflict.  That's the only way I've been able to deal with dad marrying someone who can't stand me.  Good luck!
My little boy got stomach flu. I knew I was going to get it but I worked hard to make sure my mother wouldn't.

I double bagged all waste, Cloroxed sprayed and wiped everything behind me and double bagged our laundry and kept it separate from everything to be washed on hot with a few drops of bleach.

My mother decided to do the laundry. I told her to please leave the quarantined bags alone.

She insisted that there was no reason she couldn't wash them, she'd be fine.

Well now she's in the bathroom puking her guts out. For me and lil man stomach flu means two days in bed and some anti nausea meds. For a 67 year old woman with MS it means a trip to the damned ER and possibly a hospital stay all because she wouldn't leave a damned bag of laundry alone.

I'm angry because she never listens to me and sees me trying to keep her from doing the laundry as a challenge rather than sincere concern to keep her from getting ill.

I don't know how to bridge this communication gap and right now I have a very sick mum to take care of

Fuck it all.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.
It might not have mattered that she handled the dirty laundry or not.
Stomach bugs usually hide out in the body for a few days.  She could have contracted the bug when you didn't know your kid had it.  Or just because it's soooooo easy to get, especially with someone who has a suppressed immune system.  I am sure handling the laundry didn't help.  

I hate the stomach bug.  I'm sorry :(
Not sure how to update so I'll just leave this.  She's better. Federal guidelines bedamned, I shoved a couple of my Zofran down her throat and at least the vomiting has stopped and she merely feels achy and miserable. To do any less would have been cruel. 

Lil man got sick on Friday. I got sick on Sunday. She made it all the way until Wednesday after doing the laundry on Tuesday.  (Honestly I had considered just taking the loss and throwing the small pile away.)

I love my mom but I'm feeling like she's Jack Sparrow taking a coin from the box just to see what happens.

I'm delusional from lack of sleep. Thanks again for listening. 

If she was around your son she was going to get it. That it is with kidm my kids barely sniffle and me, whonhas no immune system, ends up with bronchitis. I know it is frustrating when she doesn't listen, but it sounds like she loves younand wants to help.

Before anything I wanted to say that I'm not very familiar with Reddit and if i do anything wrong please do tell me.

So I'm 18 years old and I work at a grocery store with minimum wage. My parents have a stable financial income and I have a 13 years old brother. Since i started working, my parents started to get mad at me when i buy food or drinks for myself with my own money and they always tell me to "share between the whole family". I get where they're coming from and i do share if i buy a bag of chips or a big bottle of soft drink but they expect me to give half of what i bought to my little brother (or share between everyone equally) which i think is quite a lot. My brother did not work for it and i do give him some but they expect me to give more than i usually would give which i think is not right. I know i sound like a little kid arguing about that but its not JUST when i buy chips or drinks. It really frustrated me when i buy expensive food too (like pizza that costs $40) and really gets me because my parents would never buy those stuff themselves even if i ask for them so there is no way of me getting it unless i smuggle it home and eat quietly which sounds really stupid.

I'm just asking for your honest opinion. I'm not very good at telling stories so please if you have questions ill be more than welcome to answer them.

Thank you!
I do understand that they may just want you to share and teach you that if you are bringing things home you do need to share. But I also completely get where you are coming from. 

To share with everyone would mean you would need to buy more and then probably end up with no money left. If I were you I would not bring things home all the time and then maybe once in a while bring something home for everyone to enjoy together. That way you are still sharing with everyone but are still able to save your money for later in life. 

They might also be trying to teach you the value of money and how quickly it can go. 
It might be about bringing it in the house and the others seeing. If my children have treats, they all know if the other kids see, they have to share. I would never expect to bring home a thing of chocolates and eat in front of the other kids and not share. 

Just drink and eat it at work, or keep it hidden when at home (if possible. when I was a kid, my nasty brother would just search my stuff for things so that would not have worked for me).
It could be that they are teaching you to share what you have. It could be they see you with stuff and want to be fair to your brother, though it is unfair to you. If you aren't paying room and board then it is a small price to pay. Don't bring it home if you don't want to share. 
I'm really confused as to what I should do. I told his immediate family a month ago what he did but I haven't told my parents about it. I would only go because my immediate family is expecting me to, and it seems like the "bigger" thing to do, but I also don't want to go for obvious reasons.

You go to a funeral to "pay respects"...of which you don't have any.

The larger issue is how to tell your family, telling his immediate family is surely going to get back to your family.
Im not the christian type but im always telling people its better to forgive some one then to drag something out forgiving someone helps relieve the burden from ones heart so in my opinion forgive him and show to his funeral let him know he is forgiven tell him you love him even though he had a moment of weakness we all make mistakes and dont mean them sometimes and later regret them i hope my words make it to you and sorry for the loss of a family member.....PS As for other family members knowing if they dont know now dont tell them let the family love the memory of him as it stands
You do what you need to do. You don't owe anyone any explainations.
Just go. Dont bring up anything on it just show and leave
If you don't go, you might have regrets.  But he's gone now... least you can do is attend and while what he did was awful, think about the good times & memories you had with him and not just think about the bad times.  Look at things from both sides.  Maybe you can try to put yourself in ur cousin's place and be understanding, you're cousin sounded lonely, had nobody else, acted on urges on the wrong person (on a family / relatives member).  It happens.

If i were you, I'd go.  You should gather up your relatives and parents, everybody at the funeral and give a speech.  Mention the rape.  It will be very brave of you..  Be 100% honest & truthful.  And while the rape was messed up, also mention there are good memories and you wanted to be there for him today on his deathbed.  The average person will be understanding, people can appreciate the real truth even though it is an unpleasant one.  I hope you will come up with the courage to bring it up in a speech and really let others know how you felt and what you experienced with your cousin.  It will feel like a fresh breath of air because the more you hold in a secret that hurts... that more it hurts you in the long run.  It will help if you wrote it down in letter form so you know exactly what to say.  That's what I would recommend.
That must be very hard to deal with. I'm sorry that happened to you. Not to sound morbid, but, he is gone now, so there's no way he'll try again or attempt revenge for you telling his family. If you don't go, you'll have to explain why to a lot of people, and I'm not sure if you want to do that, considering you haven't told your family yet. So that's something you'll need to consider. If it was me, I would probably go. 
Hello Everyone this is actually my first day on Reddit and would like to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving and hope you are all having it with respective families or some one you love, so i wish all of you well and again happy Thanksgiving
Happy Thanksgiving! Hope you have an awesome day!
Thanks so far so good
My wife's father passed away in February 2014 after a long battle with mental and physical illness. Together, him and my MIL ran a group home for individuals with special needs. FIL struggled with severe mental illness for many, many years, so my MIL (now 50) dedicated most of her young life caring for people with severe mental handicaps, including her own husband.

Keep i mind, she had a deep, deep love for this man. Through sickness and in health, they were inseparable. 

My wife and I had been dating for over 13 years when he died, and I was very involved in their family (I worked for them in their home for 5 years), and we spent weekends, vacations together, etc. This family's bond was extremely strong.

After he died a lot changed. The youngest of three daughters moved out, I got a new job elsewhere, and we stopped seeing MIL as much.

One of the individuals who lives in the house has been there since he was about 7 (now 19 I believe) - his father pled guilty in 2010 to possessing 20,000 images of child pornography. We will call him "R". When R's son became 18, he was allowed to visit him again, and started to get involved little by little in MIL life. When FIL died, he would send her these extravagant gift boxes.

After about a year or so, we found out that after being constantly nagged by R, she agreed to go out on a date with him - to which we were floored by. Little by little, she began to see more and more of R, despite our discontent. 

Now, keep in mind, R never crosses paths with us. We avoid him at all costs. I have a 3 year old daughter, and my Sister in law has two young children that my MIL babysits almost everyday during work hours. My wife is over there with the kids as well during these hours, and it has all been made VERY clear that he is never to show his face if the children are there (he isn't legally allowed to anyway).

MIL doesn't really talk about her relationship with R because, well frankly, none of us want to have anything to do with it.

Last night around 8pm MIL sends us a text that her and R just got married, and that she realizes we will be upset, but that she is happy.

Total shock. My wife immediately called her (do not disrespect my wife, or you will get a stern earful). "What the hell were you thinking", "You have ruined everything", "Why didn't you tell us"... etc. to which MIL didn't have a single response. Nothing. Keep in mind, MIL has always been a very strong willed woman who has never filtered her opinion. Suddenly, she had no explanation or any comforting words for her daughter.

In my wife's eyes, she has lost her second parent.

---------------------------------------------------

Where do we go from here? How do we handle this? My daughter is **obsessed** with her grandmother, and now I feel I can't even bring her around, let alone stay the night on a weekend. My wife's family means everything to her. Should I confront MIL about this? I don't know if she realizes the scale of what she has done (she is a little dense sometimes). Apparently, she did it because she believes in the sanctity of marriage (she has some odd religious views, not the pushy type though), what about the golden rule? Treating others with respect? She couldn't even discuss this with her own family?

Oh, and one more thing about R - he thinks the earth is flat, and apparently MIL does too now.... I'm a little scared honestly.
You, your wife and SIL and her So if they are around need to have a sitdown and work out the new rules.

Obviously MIL can see the kids and your home. R is not allowed period. Personally I would not allow her into my life anymore, but that is me you guys can decide for yourselves.

MIL will not be allowed to take pics of the grandchildren.

outside verification from others in regards to R actually being at family events. Be prepared to pack up and leave should he just suddenly appear.

Things like that. Draw a line in the and set it on fire, the safety of those kids comes before everything an including your relationship with MIL
I would never take my kid over there as long as they are together. If she can behave while she isnover she can have supervised visits only.  If she tries to bring her crazy flat earth ideas or her new husband into the conversation the visit is over. Frankly, I would point blank tell her she made her bed and she can lie on it. I wouldn't want someone who makes that kind of choice around my kids.
Judging by the amount of posts you have made in r/JUSTNOMIL I am hesitant to read too much into these suggestions.
My future mother in law is a saint compared to the woman you have in her life. And its not about reading too much into it, for whatever reason your Mother in law has decided to bring a predator into your lives and the lives of your children, that requires a serious response.  

So I post in JustNoMiL, so what? JustNoMil has nothing with my viewpoint on this. Its common sense. 

Is there likely something serious going on? Uh yeah, a sexual predator has married a woman who I assume still deals with vulnerable minors as part of her job. She has minors in her family. Can that be addressed in a family sit down without him? Sure. Will it work? Who knows. At the end of the day protecting those kids is the first thing you need to worry about. Potentially saving your MIL from being a potential enabler to his predilection is second.
She has been a really good person though all her life. Her entire life has been dedicated to helping people. She hasn't brought him into our lives in the slightest, she respects we don't want anything to do with him. She has brought him into *her* personal life, so yes I suppose that entagles him into our lives somewhat.

And no, she does not work with minors, all adults.
Sorry it read like R's son was the bridge to him and her meeting and thus she also dealt with minors. I still say hard and fast rules are the way to go given as you said she is/was a very intelligent woman and not the slightest bit of a pushover. That he was able to convince her into not just a relationship but also a marriage and a surprise(to you all) marriage is a concern.

I'm a very always consider the worst case scenario person, but that's not a bad thing.

Ask yourself this, if he could talk her into that, how long before he pushes that point that a) he's changed(maybe) and that b) your resistance to have him be a part of the family because of his past crimes that he's paid for is unfair to her?
As a newly engaged 25 year old I was excited to officially have my fiancé join my family and vice-a-versa. However, I just found out my aunt told my mom "this would be her last year hosting thanksgiving, or any holiday for that matter, because the family is getting too big and we should celebrate with our own individual families. As someone who looks forward to the holidays for the sole purpose of seeing my cousins, aunts and uncles that I only see a few times a year, this is pretty upsetting. 

Background:
My mom is the youngest of 4 children. 3 live within 20 minutes of each other and the other lives 1.5 to 2 hours away. We are fortunate enough to still have my grandparents who are healthy. I have my sister and 7 cousins, 6 who are married with children (10 total under 9 years of age). 

My family is a little high strung, so having these holiday meals can get a little stressful for the sibling that is hosting (all 4 alternate holidays, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas) over the years. No one exchanged gifts, it's pretty low key other than the food. Other than these holidays and the occasional wedding, baby shower, etc, we do not see/spend time with anyone in the family. As the second youngest of the cousins by 4 years, my sister being the youngest, we weren't close with my cousins due to the age difference when we were younger. 

What to do:

I can see where my aunt is coming from. I do not have kids of my own yet, however, I can see how it can/will be stressful going to both sides of the families for the holidays. But to say we shouldn't see each other and not celebrate at all? 

This really upset me and really has me bothered. Am I being selfish? I like seeing my cousins and their young children even if it's just for a couple hours. I know we should relax and enjoy ourselves around the holidays, but you can't do that the other 362 days of the year? To me, it's worth it. 

My mom has even thrown out the idea of having a dinner the weekend after the holidays, but again, it's too much of a hassle for everyone. 

It just blows my mind that my family who is so fortunate to have good health and everyone still with us is trying to avoid this "chore" of spending time together. As I think about it more maybe it's not worth worrying about if no one else is going to care? 

Is anyone in a similar situation? What do other families out there do for this? 
If everyone is alternating, then one person can't shut it all down.  Whoever wants to can keep extending invites to as many people as they can handle.  And whoever wants to accept can, or not.

I married into a family that is so big, we have to borrow tables from each other to host holidays.  We usually use my MIL's house because it's the biggest, but I've hosted at my own house in the past too.

The KEY is that non-hosts show up before the event (sometimes a day or two before) and we all bust our butts.  Everyone has assigned jobs, the host is more of a coordinator than anything.  Women cook, men clean up.  Older kids take younger kids for a hike or to see the horses.  Someone is in charge of laundry.  Someone is in charge of the tables.

Where there's a will, there's a way.  Just gotta figure out who has the will.
It is not easy to host that many people and I can understand it being too much. Inwouldmmake plans to do a smaller Thanksgiving with just your immediate family. If yo want to have an event where you can see everyone, maybe you can arrange a family get together at some point. Host it somewhere big enough and have everybody bring something. That way one person isn't responsible for everything.
I grew up in a large family, many sibs, then we all had kids, now They all have kids and even though a large percentage have moved far away there are still enough to make any true/full family gathering at least 35 people.

Our poor Dad, he and stepmom used to host Xmas eve, that was tradition. When he got sick, I volunteered, having the largest amount of space in my home.

Well lemme tell ya, that gets old really fast. Even with folks bringing a dish or a snack or their own drinks, no one supervises their screaming jumping sugar high little ones, no one helps clean up, half of them get drunk, it's crowded, it's hot (midwest in winter, we turn OFF the heat and open the windows and it's still hot, cooking yanno) and it's exhausting.

They come in, tear the house to shit, steal your meds, break stuff, create 4 dishwasher loads of dishes, to be taken out, space found for and then all put away again and the HOST has to do all the work, pretty much on their own.

No one else Ever volunteers so finally I just stopped.
I love my family. But we finally had to just have our own grown children and their kids. 
Cuz that big family shit, when not taken turns or meeting somewhere (restaurant) is a huge job to take on. 

I miss seeing my adult sibs and their kids. But not once have they ever said, hey stop by sometime during the holiday season, we will have a nice visit.    Never.

Eventually the next generations just kind of split up. Also there is always the issue if both sets of parents are still nearby. 
When I was a kid, we went to Dad's parents for Xmas Eve, Mom's parents for Xmas day.
When I was little, I walked into my brothers fort and they were hanging out with a bunch of their buddies. They invited me in and my oldest brother said," Hey Pam, look down your shirt and spell attic". I didn't get it till a few years later. Boy, was I embarrassed.
I still don't get it.   Nvm, am tired.   lol
I was born into a Christian family with both my parents being die-hard Christians. My dad was always calm, but my mother has always been pushy. When I graduated from high school, my mother despised the fact that I was studying out of state for two years. She felt like I wasn't ready for the world and that I should go to a community college nearby. I refused her opinion, and moved out. 
After returning, my mom has suddenly become so aggressive. She barks at me when I get home at 9:00 pm and she got into a tantrum when she saw my clothes on the floor on my room. On Sunday, I overslept and I missed church, and my mom went into insanity. She started screaming for nearly 15 minutes, then went into her room. I went inside the bathroom to take a shower when I heard a loud "boom" from my room. I come out and I see her throwing my xbox one along with my games (600$) around the room. She saw me and just shouted "HOPEFULLY THIS WILL STRAIGHTEN YOU OUT" and she stormed into her room. 
I'm 21 years old. I love my mom but she's crossed the line this time. I've never even shouted at mom until today, and this was big. I don't know what to do, I don't know why she still treats like a child. My dad always sides with her, regardless of the issue. 
You should ask her to pay for it once she's called down. That shit's expensive. I know my dad would have me working three jobs to pay it off if I broke his Xbox
Move out.
She would just get angrier and refuse to pay for it. 
Ah. I would sue her for destruction of property. Make her cover all the expenses. But, I really, really hate my mother.
My mother passed away recently, and I was there with her on her final day. No-one else was, which has had the effect that I'm at a different stage of grieving to everyone else, I feel I'm past the crying and am back to feeling level-headed again, which creates a new problem, in that now other people burst into tears and I'm left feeling maybe I should pretend to be more grief-striken than I really am, just for their sake. But of course, that just seems stupid. Has anyone else had that?
I'm sorry for your loss.   Everyone grieves in their own way, you aren't under any obligation to fake any stage of mourning.


I have had that recently, but with a pet.   I knew she was going to pass and the SO didn't believe me.   I felt like I came off as a cold uncaring bastard a little because I had mourned far sooner.   
I am sorry for your loss. Everyone grieves differently. Sometimes it is shock. Sometimes you grieve before the person passes because they were ill for a while. Sometimes you are good with things because you treasure the happy times. You don't need to explain yourself to anyone and you don't have to fake anything. You aren't some kind of monster. There is no right way to grieve. You do what feels right to you. Just to warn you, it is possible to be in a bit of shock, even if you expect it. It may all come back up in a few weeks. Or it might not. Everyone is different.

For what it's worth, I am a mom and I wouldn't want my kids to be sad all the time. I would want them to remember the good times and be happy.

For us it's been dealing with a large number of visitors, every week. Babe is 3 months old and has three sets of grandparents, all relatively local. All six of them want to see him every week. My husband and I have eight siblings that also want regular visits, not to mention cousins, great aunts and uncles, friends, etc. This is mostly a good thing, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the many people in our life that love our baby. But this week we have visitors literally every day, they stay too long, ask a lot of questions, don't know how to change a cloth diaper, are loud while my husband is trying to sleep (working night shift), often don't know what the baby needs so I'm delicately trying to hint that he's tired/ hungry/ wants to be down flat / sat up, etc. Add in the annoying aspects of just about any family member, and that it's not every once in a while, it's every DAY, and it's just exhausting for all of us.

We've tried setting time limits (they just stay until I have to awkwardly ask them to leave, and still try to convince me to let them stay longer "to help"), doing group visits (they all just ask for another time to visit by themselves), scheduling to meet them somewhere like a park or restaurant (not something I can do 7 days a week, especially as weather changes), and just refusing visitors for a week (they keep pestering until I schedule something with them the next week). One set likes morning visits, one set likes all day because they drive 3 hours to get here, one set is ten minutes away and often stops by with food or a gift, and one grandparent works and can only visit after 6pm or weekends. It's just too much and makes it impossible for us to have our own routine. This is just a huge rant, but I don't know what else to do at this point. Three months in and I'm ready to snap 
Sounds tough more over when you are trying to create a bond with your baby. Thanks for sharing!
I work 60 hours a week. The lass works 30ish. So... Keeping the house in order. Mainly dishes and laundry.

Fees I really gotta do laundry tomorrow.
I am a college student comfortably living with my single mother while I finish school.  Our living situation works well with our current position. I keep my mother company all while enjoying the benefits of free living.  Our problem lies with my 28 year old cousin that mysteriously needed a new place to live a little over a year ago.  He had previously been kicked out of the father's home, (for reasons unknown to me) and had since been living with his grandparents.  Nothing seemed to change with his grandparents at all yet he desperately needed a new place to live and chose to ask my mother for help.  Despite my concerns, we made the decision to allow him to move in.  In the second month of him living with us we started to notice a profound odor coming from him and his room.  We did what we could to handle the issue starting with subtle generic comments about odor, and lots of Lysol.  We hoped that at some point he would just take a hint.  To no avail we moved on to more direct forms of communication, which was very hard on my mother.  It was hard for her to tell a 28 year old man that he needed to shower more than once a week.  We stayed diligent on the comments for a short period of time however my mom began to feel really effected by having to continually tell him to bathe, wash his clothes, brush his teeth, and wash his bedding.  I admit it was quickly getting pretty ridiculous.  I tried to take matters into my own hands in my own way, proclaiming my refusal to support or acknowledge him until he had a better handle on personal hygiene.  Either from my moms nagging or my proclamation things did seem to get somewhat better for a while.  Manageable, really.  Meaning we kept his door shut at all times and burnt candles at an alarming rate.  He has since settled into our home and graduated college, however in the past month things have gotten very bad.  His room it littered with clothing we don't know are clean or dirty, the stench is creeping out his closed door into the hallway and living area and wherever he is follows a pluming cloud of body odor that spans atleast 4 feet in every direction. If I were my mother I'd be afraid to have guests over, or even let the Schwann man in the entrance way for no less than five minutes.  My mother is getting very irritable and looks visually defeated.  I just don't know what to do anymore and am in need of some advice.  How do you clearly instill personal hygiene on a 28 year old man? How I say!?!?

Edit: I appreciate the idea but I forgot to mention that sadly this isn't my house and my mom would never do that to him.  She would never threaten to kick him out.  She feels sorry for him.  Any other ideas?
[deleted]
I agree with /u/Mdmary. I would add to be careful he doesn't burn the place down if he is lighting a lot of candles. I would say he has a week to clean up or start looking for a new living situation.
Maybe it's time to put a 30 day notice to vacate in his room (or on the door so you don't have to open it), so either he will get the point or maybe he will just move out. Is he a violent or confrontational person? 
I don't want to over-reach or assume, but perhaps he has anxiety about showering? In many cases of persons with depression and anxiety around personal hygiene, the person experienced abuse, sometimes sexual abuse, when going about their personal hygiene habits. 

Does he show any signs of depression or anxiety? I know it can be difficult to talk to anyone about mental health or past abuse, but if that's the cause of his infrequent showering, then dropping hints, and lighting candles isn't going to solve this, or change his behaviour. 
Thank you for the recommendation, I will bring it up to my mother and hope for the best.
Yeah this is another problem, he oped for a candle warmer instead of an open flame but leaves it on AT ALL TIMES. It's dangerous.
He is in no way a violent or confrontational person, quite honestly he has a physical disability in his hands and feet keeping him from running or squeezing.  He still lives independently though and has every capability of taking care of himself.  This is just one of the reasons my mother wont kick him out.
Hello Redditers, 

I've been a lurker for quite some time now, but I'm currently in a patch of life where I have no one that I truly trust. So, I decided to hurdle my fear of the Internet and reach out to you all for some advice.

I have a lovely family (my mom and my 9 siblings), and I love them very much. We are white, traditional Roman Catholic (Sedevacante), and Right-wing conservatives (or at least that's the only choice offered to us by our mom). They are loving, laughing, witty people, and generally extraordinary nice, except for one particular topic. They are quite intolerant of others who do not fit our mould/culture.

I am the only one in my family that has graduated college, goes out on the weekends, has gay friends, and dates interracially. As of late, my family has begun to shun, dismiss, and refer to me as unintelligent, because I am kind to other races/religions/etc at all times and express discomfort when they make jokes about people of other races. 

Granted, my family members are kind to everyone in person, regardless of race. But behind closed doors, they make jokes about racial stereotypes that make me cringe inside, and talk about how we are above others because our values are seemingly better than those of other races. They also pre-judge people and assume their values based off of skin tone, and distance themselves from other races. 

I am currently going out with a Mexican/Salvadorian guy, who is intelligent, driven, protective, sweet, and passionate. My family has yet to meet him, but they have already expressed their disapproval and said he has a bad character. This they assumed, because he has tattoos and works out so he is built, but most of all because he is not white (although they remain silent/sidestep when I ask if their disapproval is based on race). 

My siblings patronize me and attempt to humiliate me via debate when I defend other races or express discomfort at their racial perceptions and jokes, and my mother puts me down in front of the family when I defend my social choices (i.e. speaking kindly of other races/religions/sexualities/etc) in order to make an example of me to the others so that they will not listen to my views. 

I feel that my open-mindedness and acceptance of other people is driving a wedge between me and my family, but I simply cannot find it in my heart to agree with them or be silent about it any more. 

So reddit, I would like your opinion. Are my family members racist? And if so, what can I do about it? I love them all so much, and they're not bad people... They help everyone and anyone they come across and live life as fully as they can. It hurts me when they push me away, but is it better that I stay away from people that breed hatred, no matter how slight it may seem? They're never racist in person, but within our circle their true opinions are clear to see... Thank you for your thoughts. 
They sound like they are racist. Racism isn't always overt and it sounds like they understand it isn't socially acceptable as they only act that way in private. Some people have a disconnect and don't understand things aren't socially acceptable because it isn't right over all. All you can do is what you are doing. You aren't going to change their minds. Your siblings will parrot your parents for now. Maybe when they get out into the real world they will see things the way you do, but there is no telling. It is hard to change. I say keep doing what you are doing and don't let their prejudices prevent you from living your life. You may not get the support you deserve, but you are doing good and you are not in the wrong here.
Thank you for your input, I really appreciate your perspective. It makes me sad that they are this way... I hope they change someday. 
They may not change, but you are awesome. You were raised to be like them and rose above it. That isn't easy and says a lot about your character.
I had a lamb as a small child. She was my favorite stuffed animal. As everyone knows, the favorite toy usually gets worn the most. He told me one day that he would get me another one. I was 5/6, when he told me that. It was so long ago I had forgotten his promise to me. I just got a lamb the other day. He kept looking for one similar to mine for over 10 years. My grandpa never forgot his promise, and he continued to search for it. This means the world to me. It's something I never will forget. 
That is so sweet. Grandpas are special. I lost mine almost 5 years ago and this is like something he would do. Be sure to tell him how much it means to you and how much he means to you.
I did! I'm happy to have him around. 
I'm sorry for your loss. It's hard to lose a grandparent. 
Thank you. He was a very special man. It is good to hear such a heartwarming story. Thanks for sharing it :)
You're welcome :-) 
My mom died a few years ago very tragically. Me and my father had a falling out a few months before his illicit affair and leaving my mom with nothing such as leaving her without power and food, basically abandoned her when she couldn't help herself. We have since had a working relationship since I was diagnosed with cancer this year. My dads side of the family is all the family I had ever had. The day after she died I was in my grandmother's kitchen balling my eyes out, my grandmother looked at me with hate and said I wasn't blood related to them, and that my dad wasn't my real dad, I had heard this from my mom once before but she recanted a few hours later. She was married to my uncle, my dads brother which resulted in my older brothers. My parents got together 5 years later after that. My uncles name is on my birth certificate..my grandmother told me not to come over for Thanksgiving which my mom died 2 days before. My older brother had asked if I was still coming right after that and I said "Didn't you just hear her, she don't want me here", I then left and didn't talk to my grandmother until recently out of my older brother being injured which I'm still disgusted at the sight of her. I then took this as my grandfather not caring which I did not talk to until late last year, when I was diagnosed with cancer he called twice to see if I was OK and seemed genuinely concerned and when I talked with him recently he didn't care about my situation with being evicted because I'm not allowed to work right now with the chemotherapy. He was cold instead of concerned. My other brother, the oldest, we have had heat since before my mom died, the reason being is attitude of having to pick up mom at the hospital and bring her home and wouldn't help her to the car and I had too which I didn't mind. After I came back outside he said "I know that's my mom in there but I'm not going to be losing any sleep over this" which angered me. A few months later she died and he raided her house and basically stole items of mine which I asked him not to touch which he stole. The hatred is so strong between the both of us we haven't spoken in 4 years and I don't care to with this particular brother. My uncle (my two brothers father) owns his own business and has one employee that has been the friend of the family since I was young child and I ran into them today and all my uncle could say was "didn't recognize you" and walked off and his employer (family friend) I went to shake his hand and he grabbed me and hugged me and said "I have been so sick worried about you, I've been meaning to come up and see you but my truck won't make it). My uncle did however check on me every once in awhile he said, this was a few years ago. I'm not sure what changed? He hates my brothers and was never around for them growing up and treats his step children even better then them. He always used to be cool with me but it seems things are different when I run into him on occasion. I'm not one to worry about it usually but it's bothering me as of late. Few people know about my illness because I don't want alot of people on my case or worried. It felt really good to know that somebody besides my wife and best friends cared about me to let me know that. It also hurt that my family seems not to care that much, my dad does but there's animosity towards him still. I just can't figure out why my family has always treated me different, maybe because I'm not really of the bloodline? I've never done drugs or been in trouble, I have always treated them with respect and it seems after my mom died, they just decided to wash there hands of me. I'm not trying to receive pity, I'm just curious if anyone would know based on the information I have given on why things are the way they are? Thanks for reading!
I am so sorry. The sad thing is people being family doesn't make them good people. I am so sorry you have been through so much. If you ever need to talk I am here any time.
It sounds like you'd be better off without them.

Yes. My sister. I realized a long time ago not to over extend myself because she would take and take. I set my expectations low and she still disappoints.

So I found out you should be using the same headphones and I have really bad dandruff (him too I believe), the ploblem I am afraid to say it because it would make him think I don't want him to use it because I just bought it next week. He has his own cheap sony headphones But I never seen him use it. This my computer yet it is in the living room because he doesn't want to buy his own.  I'm 26, and by god, I am still afraid of asking my dad these questions because I don't know how he would react.
Don't leave yours out. Put them away every time. This would mean he has to at least ask you if he wants to use them. If he asks and you don't want to flat out say no, tell him that you read that it is not a good idea to share headphones. But at this point I would just tell him no.
My kids love doing this with me. Thought I'd share - http://yosagihomestead.blogspot.com/2016/09/homemade-applesauce-you-can-do-with.html?m=1
I was on my phone when my sister walked into my room asking to borrow my TV so she could watch a tv show with her friend. I said no because lately shes been taking alot of my stuff, she lost her laptop charger so she takes mine, when she has work she takes my shirt when she cant find it, she also takes my work shoes when she has work. she does all this without even asking me and it pisses me off so ive decided to limit her to the things she borrow from me so she doesnt think she can take what she want when she wants from me.
Anyway I eventually let her use it and she said I could watch as well so I took the tv to her room and set it up for her, I then grabbed my pillow from my room and put it on her bed when she tells me i cant go on her bed because there isnt enough room.
basically it got to the point where she was telling me to get everything to connect her laptop to the tv and was bossing me around. I told her she could get it and then she got pissy and said don't bother take your tv and get out so i did and as i was leaving she said, actually seeing as your not using the tv just give just let us borrow it, i refused and tried to leave but she held onto the tv so i couldnt leave. she eventually let it go and i went to my room to play a videogame. she came into my room and kept nagging me to let her borrw the tv, i repeatedly said no but she didnt leave, i started telling her to fuck off and when she persisted i tried to remove her physically, it didnt work so i tried to ignore her but then she went to take the tv, eventually it led to me trying to pish her out, she punched me in the stomach, i pinched her back and she acted as if she was innocent, had done nothing wrong and i was being mean.
I was wondering if i was being unreasonable and should of just let her borrow the tv.
thoughts?  
You weren't unreasonable until the physical violence. Lock your door and explain to your parents she can't borrow anything until she learns a little respect.
Well, the *Actions* were unreasonable, your feelings that caused them, aren't.  There's a difference.
What you need to do is explain...calmly and observationally..what your concerns and issues are with her when you're both calm, not in the heat of the moment.

When people live together they sort of take liberties without thinking much about them, they just assume it's OK.  What you'd need to do is let her know what really is OK and what isn't and then get her to agree.

But refusing to let her have the TV without an explanation seems mean ...and won't resolve the real issue anyways.  And, giving in and feeling angry won't either.  Talk with her.

Condensed back story:
My mom left my dad for another man, got pregnant with me, that man left her, she got back together with my dad, who adopted me. I didn't find out about all that until I was 14 (I am now 23). Well a couple years ago, my sperm donor found me and made contact with me and we messaged on Facebook for a few months but never met in person and he ghosted me. Haven't heard from him since.

 Well while we were still corresponding, he told me that he has 3 other children, 2 boys (like 13 and 11 maybe?) and another daughter (17 or 18) I have been wanting to reach out to her (because she is the oldest) and see if I can start a relationship with her and the boys but I'm not sure how to approach the situation. I'm pretty sure that jackass never told them about me, so I have been waiting until she turned 18 because I didn't want to come crashing into her life while she was still in school.

 I creep on her Facebook sometimes trying to find the right words to message her. I guess I'm just looking for some advice? What would you want an unknown sibling to say to you? Lol would you want to know that you had another sibling out there?

**tl;dr** I have a bio sister and 2 brothers who don't know I even exist but I want to reach out to the oldest (18f) but don't know how to approach the subject in a Facebook message.
If you message her on FB she may not see it because of their filters. You could message her and then post to her page that you pm'd her. 

You could be simple and direct "Hi, I know you don't know me, but I think we share the same Dad [name], and I would like to talk to you." 

Saying "I think" might make it easier for her to handle and approach. Then the ball is in her court. She can talk to your dad and get the details or contact you. She also may not want to or have the courage to contact you back, but you put it out there, and the ball is in her court. 
I'm not sure how it would go, but when I found out I had half-siblings, I asked my biological father (a stranger) to tell them about me and give them my contact information.  If your father ghosted you, he might not do it, but since he knows you could approach them regardless of what he does, he might.  My biological father won't speak to me, but he did tell my half-siblings about me when I asked him to, and they reached out.  I think the news seemed more legit coming from their father than from a stranger.  Whatever you decide to do, good luck!
I would say keep your expectations low. These other siblings may want to know you or they may not. It is your choice to reach out, and then the ball is in their court. My husband found out he has a sibling who grew up without their dad. She is older and has never reached out and neither has he. He doesn't care to know her. Personally, I would want to. Everyone is different.

You can tryou sending a message. I would be clear that you understand this is difficult and you don't want anything except a chance to know your siblings. Then all you can do is wait.
Well, I've been single for 8 months now, and it's been a rough path, so I decided to try out Tinder just to see what happens. And there he is, my dad! My 55 year old dad on Tinder. He cheated on my mom twice (he kept a second "wife" for six years when I was like 4 or something, and my mom found messages of him talking to a supposedly girlfriend of his. He denied and things just went back to normal) and I think he's cheating on her again now. I have a terrible relationship with him because of the whole cheating thing and I just feel like I've never really forgiven him. And now I just don't know what to do, really. He's been married to my mom for 25 years and I'm an only child. His family is rich and my mom's really poor, meaning that my dad supports my mom's entire family. So if I decide to confront him and tell my mom about it, it's likely that, if they get a divorce, my mom's entire family will be left with nothing (my dad's the owner of all of their houses and stuff). I'm really conflicted right now. There's a chance that even if I tell my mom she's just gonna ignore it in order to maintain her family's well-being. But I hate that he's lying to her and getting away with it, it's just so hurtful. I honestly don't know what to do! I feel like I won't be able to look him on the face if I let this go. Please, help meee!
I think your best bet is to stay out of it. If you don't think she will do anything then it could just cause stress. Or you could happen to check Tinder while you are with her and "accidently" come across him. I don't know. It is tough. If you feel the need to tell her then do so, but don't set any expectations when it comes to her responce. She is the one who gets to decide how to handle this.
Yeah, I really think she won't do anything about it, so I better just stay out of it. But man, it's gonna suck. Just wish I hadn't gotten the goddamned app!
I am so sorry that you have been put in this position. It is completely unfair.

This is so true. He's finally at the age where he can get himself a snack and juice box and entertain himslf for maybe 30 more minutes while I "sleep" a bit more, but still. During the week you'd think we were dragging him out of bed to go to labor camp. 
Hi! Does anyone's parents/grandparents use home meal delivery services like Heart-to-Home or Wiltshire Farms? What are they like? Why did you go for them? I'm considering trying to get my parents to sign up. Would love to chat to someone to ask their thoughts and opinions.
My grandmother had Meals on Wheels service.  She was in sw florida and my mother had signed her up for it.  My mother thought the service was great and thought the service was great.  They were really nice and sweet to my grandmother and would even bring tiny gifts on holidays.  That's what i remember my mother saying.  I was young and wasn't very involved with it back then so I can't give you a personal review   But that was my mothers review who would know.  She had only positive things to say about them.
My younger brother (early 20s) is experiencing some difficulties at the moment. He keeps failing out of school (just found this out for the second time, second school, Fs across the board) and just got fired from his job for lack of dependability. He's showing symptoms of anxiety/depression and is presently seeing someone. I'm aware that therapy takes time, but in the interim I'm trying to figure out what to say to him. I don't want to share empty advice that would inevitably fall on deaf ears, though honestly I'm at a loss on what to tell him. I worked hard in school and landed a good job in a city after graduation, so unadulterated empathy is unachievable in this situation.
He's currently living at home and my parents are typically quite supportive and fair, though tough. They both have worked extremely hard to get where they are today - so I can understand where they're coming from. This is becoming a cycle, and I am terrified that it will get worse. He has a big, loving, and supportive family and I'm beginning to think he's losing touch with that. We have always been very close and have always trusted each other with everything. I'm sad and scared that he's going go down a truly dark path. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What should I tell him? Thank you in advance for your input.
Tell him what you are feeling. You are concerned and want to help him. Talk to him and see what he is feeling. Don't try to make him feel bad about his grades, but tell him how concerned you are. 
My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years. We have 2 kids together and he has 2 from a previous relationship that ended nearly 8 years ago.

This weekend is "our weekend" and his sister is having a party for her 3 year old daughter. We have been invited to the bbq party but so has his ex girlfriend and while her and i are finally civil with each other ... i just dont feel comfortable with the idea.

When our kids have birthday parties she doesnt come and she hasnt but now his sister has invited her to her kids party. Last year she invited her and not me (and her nieces ) as it wasnt our weekend with the kids ...

So what do i do? Speak to my boyfriend about it? Speak to his sister? I just feel its disrespectful. Does anyone agree or am i being a dick
If he has kids with this woman then they are family too. If everyone is civil it is not right to expect her and her kids to be cut out of the family because they are no longer together as a couple. Would you want your kids to never be invited to see their cousins if you and your boyfriend broke up? It doesn't sound like anyone is being disrespectful. It sounds like they are acting like adults. I understand it may be uncomfortable for you, but you are with someone who has kids with someone else as well as you and that means he is going to see this woman. If the kids spend any time with their dad and you, well, you need to be able to adjust and be, at a minimum, civil. The uncomfortable feeling I can understand a bit. The feeling disrespect is a bit of a stretch. Once you have kids with someone that person is going to be a part of your life forever. You can't have a double standard of her kids versus your own. 
My Mom has been in extended nursing care for several months and we fear she's not far from passing away. 
Her birthday is August 30 and I'm kinda at a loss as to how I'm going to approach her birthday. It is made especially difficult by the fact that I'm the youngest child and have always made her birthday a priority. 

She's bedridden, miserable, dying. The thought of bringing her a new jumpsuit or other gift seems trivial. 
Oh did I mention my wife is 12 weeks pregnant and we may not have a chance to tell my mom?

What would you do?
Hi Bobby,

I know all too well what you're going through. My mother, currently, is in a nursing facility as well. Although she has some life left, looking at her you wouldn't know it. She has been very ill for most of my life, and in the course of growing up under her roof I came to realize some very important things about family, but I won't get too deep into that here.

For her birthday, I can almost guarantee that she would love nothing more than to have you spend the day with her. If she is able to get into a wheelchair, then wheel her around the facility and just talk. Talk about the old days, talk about the future, your accomplishments, her accomplishments, family history, whatever. Maybe even get a couple more (not too many) family members involved.

Communication is key. An interesting thing I've noticed in those who are dying is that the longer you keep in communication, the longer you keep them RELEVANT, the longer their lifespan is. My grandmother was able to bounce back from a broken hip and broken vertebrae in her early 90's as a result of keeping her relevant/needed and loved in our family, and is currently bouncing right back from pneumonia and congestive heart failure at 96 years old because of this.

Just an example, humble yourself and ask her advice on any aspects of your life. For those who don't have long left, the feeling of being needed is the greatest gift of all.

Best wishes to you and yours,


Cody
Age 23
I agree with /u/LivingJaguar; however, I would tell her about her future grandchild. If you don't want it to spread to other family members, tell her you just want her to know, and that may make it all the more special. Sorry about your mom. 
I agree with the other advice here.I am so sorry you are going through this. I would tell her about her grandchild. The news may bring her some joy. I would make her gift something that brings her comfort. This could be her favorite foods, her favorite movie, something that will bring a smile to her face. Best of luck.
Since I last wrote, Mom has been to the hospital three or four different times with mini-stroke ailments. 
It looks like this last visit will probably be her last, as she is basically non-responsive from the last seizure/stroke. we are looking in to hospice options now. 
I know nobody will likely read this, but I appreciate the small comfort this post brought me and my wife. Thanks /u/LivingJaguar and others for your help. 
Anytime, Bobby. Prayers coming your way. Best wishes to you and yours.
Hi,
I'm 14 years old and I am currently in grade 9. All throughout my life I have always been the lowest point of my family, and I want to change that. My sister is better than me at almost everything (I am not exaggerating), my father works tirelessly day and night to keep everyone happy and pay for our ventures overseas, and my mother stays at home and works all day, driving back and forth to pick people up and drop them off, cooking, cleaning, and everything in between. I greatly appreciate all of the work that they are doing for me and I am proud to be a member of this family. However, ever since I can remember I have always been scolded, threatened, occasionally slapped, told to leave the house, told to kill myself, and I have even been threatened with a knife. I do not in any way suggest that my family is abusive, and most of these things happen only in extreme cases. I completely understand that this all happens because my parents only want the best for me (my mother is the main culprit). My father told me that I am treated like this because I cannot speak properly to my mother, and that she has the same issue, so we automatically clash. My father is a lot more understanding, and he helps me get around these problems without using violence. He is the main role model in my life, and it breaks my heart when I see that he is disappointed, every time he talks to me about my behaviour.

The problem is, that I don't understand how I can possibly be as terrible as to deserve the punishments that I listed earlier. I don't see myself as troublesome, and I certainly do not have any issues with my temper, and 75% of the time I am yelled at because I have apparently talked in a rude tone, I do not see it. I am the primary cause of all the heartache in my family. When I talk to my friends at school, they constantly swear, make inappropriate jokes and they do not achieve as highly as I do in school. They are very good people, and I enjoy their company, don't get me wrong, but I do not understand how I am a worse person than they are, and that why I have to 'change'. I honestly do not understand how I can possibly deserve the punishment and heartache I receive. I am an A's and B's only student, and for my grade 8 report card I received straight A's and a single B (my parents are very proud of my achievements, and consistently tell me that as long as I try my hardest, then I am on the right track). I believe that I am a good person, even though that my parents say that my terrible behaviours at home will eventually show when I am in public (I have no issues with any of my friends, and I can talk to people normally - in summary, I am perfectly sociable and respectful). I have considered this treatment from my parents as bullying, but I have concluded that it can't be right, because they are very supportive and warm towards me alot of the time.

I don't know what to do. I have considered running away, I have talked with my father about how to improve (and I do not see it) and I have tried everything else there is possible to think of. Still, I have been told to 'change' ever since I came into this world. The word seems so unachievable as things are. I am sick and tired of being treated like this. There is so much more I could talk about, about the different punishments I've received, about how I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and much more. I just want my family to be proud of me. Currently, I feel like I am doing something wrong but I don't know what it is. I've tried talking it out, but that usually ends with me being sent outside.

I will appreciate any responses.

P.S. I'm also fairly new to reddit, so let me know if I'm doing something wrong!

Thanks,

First of all welcome to reddit, you are doing nothing wrong!

I don't usually respond to posts like this (because I often feel I lack the experience needed), but I have to say that it is a big thing to ask a 14 year old to "change". You are still a very young person and I can only speak from my own experience, but when I was 14 (20-ish today) the thing I today identify as myself just wasn't ready yet. My personality was not fully developed. I didn't consider that at the time, but when I think back that's what it was like. If someone would have asked me to change (and it happened, but not as much as in your case) back then I wouldn't know what to do. It would be like someone asking me to repaint my house in blue instead of red, but my house isn't even built yet.

The single fact that you actually do try to improve yourself (that you talked to your father about it & post here on reddit), let me tell you that you are way more mature than me and most of my friends at that age :)  It seems strange, exactly what do they want you to improve in? It's tough to know what to change if they don't say exactly tell you what's wrong.

All people are different, and just as you say most parents only wants the best for their children. But I feel like your parents are asking too much of you, and I don't like the part about them threatening doing such things to you. Though I don't know you or them, I feel like they shouldn't. I really do.

I'm no expert on this subject, but if what I wrote in any way could be helpful, then I'm glad. Sending positive thoughts!

Edit: Corrected some grammar & added a few things.

Edit2: Added some more, I tend to get carried away sometimes and forget my initial thoughts :)
Chances are you will not like my advice but it is still good advice.
Realize that despite what goes on between you and your parents,they do love you.

Show them this letter and tell them you feel you need help to learn to communicate better with them. Perhaps go to Dad as you feel he understands you better and is more patient.

Ask them for family counseling. At your age it can do a world of good, as your parents often don't have a clue what you are Really thinking or feeling and you are young and cannot often express it without angering them in some fashion.

If for some reason they don't agree to family counseling, request that you be allowed to speak with a therapist on your own. 
You need an outside adult to help you. 


Old school parenting tactics. "You must do better" said Dad to his straight A kid. Maybe work on your language when speaking to Mum? Use the formal. Always assume she is tired and wants you to help her without her having to ask for it. Do your best. Get good grades. Get out. 
I'm a 23 year old college kid who's just got a pretty good job in a Tech field. Currently I owe about $70,000 worth of student loans. It sounds like a lot, but I'm managing to make payments on a standard plan and I should be done with it in about 10 years. I'm viewing it as my purpose in life right now, and I've accepted that it's just kind and of what I have to do.

Yesterday my grandmother called me and says that she wants to give me $1,500 to help with loans. It's very very kind of her, but I'm really having a hard time accepting it. That's a lot of money for her, and realistically it's not even going to put that much of a dent on the loans. I know that she wants to help, but I don't feel it's very fair to take that much money from her. I have 3 younger siblings and a lot of cousins, and I know she can't give that much to everybody else.

I'm really in a bit of a bind because I don't want to turn her down but at the same time really bad accepting that much from her. Any thoughts or opinions on how I should handle this situation? Thanks in advance.
That is a tricky situation! I think it is a situation where you appreciate the thought so much more than anything else. My grandma does things like this and there is no saying no. You can try telling her you appreciate it so much, but the idea she could go without while you have a handle on this would make you feel too guilty? That may not go well. If you do end up accepting this offer (or are unable to turn it down), don't tell anyone what she did for you. If she really can't afford to do it for everyone else the last thing you want if for everyone to complain to grandma and bleed her dry with guilt. I wish I could tell you what to do, but only you know how she will handle it.
I just got married this week. New hubby just graduated A school and until this week I haven't seen him since last year. We've been very happy to be reunited except for the fact that his family hates me.

A bit about his family: They're a very large, close knit, black/hispanic bunch who, for the most part, live within the same neighborhood and get together often. That, stupidly, is part of what appealed to me when we were considering marriage, as my relationship with my family is the opposite. The only relative I really speak to anymore is my mother, and even that is strained. I used to like the idea of any children of mine being able to walk to Grandma's and play with their cousins, and of having big family gatherings. 

Ever since he told them we're getting married they've decided to hate me. First they accused me of being a gold digger, which is confusing considering how low he is on the rung of military rank, and the fact that, though it's taken much longer than I expected, I'm in the recruitment process and have no material gain from marrying him as we are about to have the same benefits and pay. They've pretty much dropped that as it was incredibly stupid to even think about, but having learned that I'm not changing my name they've moved on to greater insults. Now I want to "run around acting like I'm single." I told my mom that one, she said, "You didn't run around acting like you're single when you WERE single!" 

Something that bothered us even before then is that his family planned this weird out of town birthday party for his sister on the day he told them we were getting married, and didn't get back in town until the morning after. This bothered us a lot, seeing as how his family has big parties to celebrate everything, and as he's the oldest of that generation of kids (siblings and cousins) and the first to marry, we thought that his family would make a bigger deal out of it. Like, being there. 

I know his family disapproves of our ages (19 and 21) and that is part of their hatred toward me, but they've personally attacked me so many times. Their attacks don't even make any sense. I spend the majority of my free time playing video games, watching anime and reading books. "Going out" to me is out to Gamestop to pick up a new game or maybe a burger with a friend. The occasional convention if I have the money. My usual clothing of choice is baggy jeans with a baggy T-shirt. I keep my hair very short because I hate taking care of it. I don't wear makeup. I don't drink, don't smoke, and my husband is one of 3 men I've dated and the only one I've had sex with. Yet they talk about me like I'm a streetwalker with hundreds of spare boyfriends and only want to use him for...something, I don't even know at this point. I have no idea how they even thought all of that about me, and I've tried to think of anything I've said or done to give them that impression. Right now new husband is at his grandmother's without me because he said it would be best if I don't go, just for this night, considering his family's hostility last night. I understood his reasoning but can't help being a little hurt by it and I don't know what to do to make it better.



tl;dr New in-laws are pissed I didn't change my name along with other dumb and made up reasons.
Part of marriage is standing up for your sspouse, your husband has to stand up and tell them this is unacceptable and if they don't stop he needs to stop talking to them. But it has to be his choice. Don't just take it. Take it from someone with a mother in law who can be quite cruel. My husband stands up for me, but he always thought it was a mistake or misunderstanding, etc., until recently she did something vile and showed her true colors. When they say such things I would say you have the same career prospects as their son and that you will not tolerate being treated in such a way. It takes a while to change a name. It took me a good month to six weeks and I did it right away because I really wanted to. If you don't want to change your name that is absolutely fine too. There is nothing wrong with that. Don't say anythino nasty, but be firm that it is inappropriate to say such things and walk away. If your husband doesn't make a stand or decide to limit or cut communications with these people it is going to be very hard on you.

Issues like the one I will shortly discuss are often overlooked in the general scheme of things. Today, I want to write something short and hopefully encouraging for people with: dysfunctional families.

The term 'dysfunctional family' is thrown around these days, for fun. Casually, till it no longer means anything. A dysfunctional family can simply be, in today's 'casual terms', a family with varied opinions on matters or who don't let bratty teenagers do wrong things, or who have small, playful bickering.

In reality, a dysfunctional family is a serious problem, not some trivial bullsh*t. A 'dysfunctional' family is literally NOT FUNCTIONAL. Imagine a handicapped body. It's a serious matter.

A dysfunctional family can involve abnormal parents, abnormal siblings, and abnormal extended family. This does not mean that every member of this 'family' is dysfunctional. It means most of them are, or that the few who are, have a big influence on everyone else.

Today will focus specifically on the 'siblings' aspect of a dysfunctional family.

Siblings is a very interesting topic. In western countries, 'sibling rivalry' is seen as normal. In eastern countries, there is not much sibling rivalry and more respect. But, the bickering OR fights between siblings is largely ignored as something they will 'outgrow'. 

However, in dysfunctional dipsh*t families, they do not get outgrown, because it is not just 'bickering', but a real issue.

Here is my story: I have always been, from childhood, a very loving, affectionate, emotional, and close person to my 'family'. The ways in which I have been abused go beyond what words can describe on a reddit post. I will not go into the verbal, physical, emotional, mental, and psychological abuse that my narcissistic disorder mother has always imposed on to me. If you are interested, then I will make another post on that.

This post is about someone specific: my 'sister'. Only 2 years younger than me.

If you knwo ANYTHING about narcissistic mothers, you will know that they often have a 'golden child' and a scapegoat. You can guess which one i was. My golden child sister is such a low piece of shit, that even despite turning 18 recently, she has absolutely no maturity about her behaviour towards me, who has always been there for her. i've ignored all her petty drama and abusive behaviour and I've always taught her, helped her, looked after her, babysat her, sacrificed so much of my own young age for her. 

Because she is 'the golden child', I have ALWAYS been ACCUSED; BLAMED; BEATEN; SCOLDED; INSULTED; DEMEANED; for everything that has been her fault. She can make VISIBLE mistakes, but they won't matter. I can make small mistakes, but they are a reflection of my character. I have been a 'curse', and that girl, a golden child. Her mistakes means I am to blame, somehow? Her evil means I have caused it. This is the warped reality I've lived through. 

Well, here's what happened recently. She was setting up a new laptop. 18, and I was so advanced at her age, but she isn't - but I won't discuss that. I offered her help some..FIVE TIMES. 'is it working?' 'do you need help?' 'show me, i can help you'. 'let me help you'. And every time - literally no response. No nod of the head, no response. It's like I didn't exist. I'm willing to spend MY time on her (despite a load of homework and exams) and she has no acknowledgement of me. She herself couldn't even figure out something basic, but she did not feel the need to look at me when I was talking to her. I was being ignored. Then my narcissistic mother came along and told me to 'help her'. I straight away told her - I stood up for myself today - that I offered her 5 times, but she obviously needs no help and couldn't even respond to me. So what that B*CH (I'm so sorry, I started swearing around 18 and would NEVER swear, after the buildup of anger for all the abuse I've undergone) did was she went away, and came back CRYING. 18, and she's CRYING (it was an act). She pretended that 'everyone's being rude to her'. Can you BE-LIEVE that? She said that I'm 'sitting there accusing her of not answering and then I decide not to help her'. Like are you effing kidding me? Suddenly, I'm a selfish person who's 'sitting there' not helping?? WHAT?! Is it time to end myself yet, after being humiliated and abused by this 'family'? And this isn't the first time that devious freak tried to make me suffer. This has dated back to years ago and from childhood, where she has tried various techniques to be the innocent child who needs to be loved and stay in the spotlight of the narcissistic parents while laughing at the older sister's abuse.

So for anyone who has a seriously dysfunctional family. You are not alone. You are not dysfunctional like them and you aren't responsible for them. You will find people of choice, good people. You don't have to force yourself to suffer garbage. And I am now going to go cry a little, and wonder if I have a future.


Wow... pretty horrible of your mother to treat you like that. You must be a really strong person to be able to cope... i really agree with what you are saying there.
Thanks. Today's focus was on the evil sister, though.
My parents recently got divorced, and my dad is out of our family's picture. My mom kept the house, but she has a hard time paying for its mortgage. I currently don't live with my mom and don't make a lot of money. I have enough income to pay for my rent and living expenses (food, gas, internet, etc.). My mom wants me to quit my job where I live and move in back with her so that I can pay her mortgage (she really doesn't want to lose the house). I want to stay here and live independently, but I don't like seeing my mom struggle to make ends meet. What should I do? Any advice is greatly appreciated!
She should probably sell the house and move into a home she can afford. You're not obligated to put your life on hold to support someone who wants to live above their means.
No! You are her child and should not have to lay for her life. If the house is too expensive then she needs to get a roommate, move out and rent the house, or sell the house. It is completely unreasonable to even ask you to quit your job and pack up.your life and move home with her. She is only thinking about what is best for her and not what is best for you. It is completely inappropriate to expect such a thing. I would tell her your life is settled and you won't be uprooting it, but you would be happy to talk to her about her options. If she won't respect your right to live your own life you may have to limit contact with her for a while.
Many people have said no you shouldnt, but I can understand your desire to help a parent. If you do choose to move back in to help pay off the house there are a few things you must consider first. 
1. Is it relativly easy for you to find a job in your home town?

2. Any money you pay towards the morgage is it considered a gift, rent, a loan, or do you now own part of the house?

3. Are you expected to pay for any gas electric or food expenses 

Finally any agreement you may come to if you do move in should be written down, dated and signed by both parties. Without the this any money or assistance given by family member is considered a gift in a court. 

 I have had a similar situation happen with my mother and grandfather and it did not turn out well. Namely she lost upwards of $250,000 to my grandfather. 
unless she's upside down on the mortgage, sell. If you WANT to move back and pay the mortgage, get something in writing so you are an owner of record.
My boss is almost 70. He's paying all the bills for his 98 years old mother several hundred miles away and has been for twenty years. Good luck...
So after meeting my grandparents  when I was 8 yrs old and lost contact with when my mom got stationed over seas. Fast forward when I was 26 yrs old my wife encouraged me to re-make contact so I found my grandma and my grandpa. They were cautious to the situation due to the fact that they and my dad were the only ones who knew of my existence. Unfortunately I had already messaged quite a few people on Facebook who I thought were relatives. Recently one of those relatives finally opened there messages (2 yrs after the fact) and read my emails and want to confront our father about the situation. Now my mother is not pleased with this whole scenario and I can understand to a point on why but I felt this was necessary for me to reach out and know these people. Now I kinda want to fly half way across the country to meet my half siblings but I am not quite sure if that's a good idea until they confront our father. Now my mother is not pleased with this situation I can see her view points. My question is I have no idea what's going to happen and if my father is going to be accepting to reality of the situation. I guess I am wondering if anyone else has cone across a similar situation and how did that go? Or if anyone has any good advice?
My advice is that, at 26 years old, you have every right to reach out to your family. The fact that your father apparently chose to hide you from the rest of your family for 26 years isn't your problem; It's his. What he did was completely self-serving, and unfair to you and his other children. I hope your siblings want to meet you, and that you go out there and have a great time. I hope they understand that your dad is human and, therefore, not perfect, and that his relationship with your mom shouldn't have any bearing on your standing as another human being who has every right to contact her biological family. I'm not sure what your mother's viewpoint is (unless she's afraid that finding your new family will mean that she is less important to you, in which case you can reassure her that nothing changes your relationship, and your actions are about you, not her), but if you want to meet your sibs, you should meet them. You're not responsible for the lies and mistakes of the previous generation. You're not the one who apparently lied to his loved ones for 2 and a half decades. If he thought that he could bring an actual human being in the world and never have to deal with that fact, that's his problem. You exist. You get to make choices that work for you. Maybe it will be great; maybe it will be weird. You won't know until you go. 
I am getting a divorce soon. There is a good chance I will get custody, I also have the option not to fight and just let things be. However my wife is more than likely return to China with my daughter, so there are slim to no chance I will see my daughter again. 

Wife barley let's me see my daughter now, so I am considering maybe if my wife is happy. Then the baby will be happy. 

Is a 2 year old better off with the mother you think ?
If you are in the us, most states will prohibit one parent from taking the child to another state, let alone another country, without the second parents consent. I don't know if this is relevant to your situation, but there may be similar rules preventing one parent from taking a child to another country without your consent. 
I think a baby deserves both parents if they are capable. If you don't fight for her she will know it eventually and you will be the dad who gave up on her or didn't want her. Your ex can't, over to China I'd you go through the courts system  (at least, it is unlikely) and if you worry she will flee you need to take your daugher now. You seem awfully willing to let her go. If you don't want custody that is a different a story. But you will be giving her up, possibly forever. That is something I wouldn't take lightly.
That sucks. I think at 2 years old the child has a developed bond with the mom. You might have one too but different. Where does the kid feel best? That might be the better answer in regards of reaching her potential. 
It just depends on who the better parent is, not mom vs dad. I think regardless of who gets custody, barring any violent behavior on your part, you definitely have a right to see your daughter. 
The mother definitely.
It still happens quite a bit laws or no. To think about this differently, what if an American woman took her children to America from say China or the Middle East without the fathers permission? A lot of people would think she would be right to do that. 

Other countries feel the same way and its true that once the child is in that country they might be extremely hard to find. 
My father in law asked my wife to help him his wife and his wife's two 30 year old children into their new house.  He told us to come first thing in the morning. My wife says a specific time was not discussed. We have a 2 young kids. We woke up about 9 got the kids up, got them ready, fed them, and loaded them up.   All in all it took about an hour.  We called ahead.  We drove to his house, that is an hour away from our house. We got there at about 11:00.  When we got there he seemed agitated that we got there so late.  He said they were all done moving.  We helped them unload the last truck load.  He told us that he hired movers a few weeks ago and the movers got to his house at 7:30.  He gave a quick tour of his new house and we started to talk a bit.  He kept being short with my wife, I tried to calm things with small talk.  

We started to talk about his new house.  He said it might not have been a great time to buy since our housing market is so high.  I told him it is going to keep going up for a while since most new building permits are not in his market.  He then started to go on a kind of a rant about getting a reverse mortgage since he doesn't want to leave his kids any inheritance.  He said he was never given anything. He wants to travel with his wife.  I do not see anything wrong with that. All I really said was "sure spend it. Can't take it with you"

My wife asked if he needed any help unpacking the kitchen or anything.  He said that him and his daughter in law and son in law were going to lunch and rush us out.  He did not seem to want us to go and certainly did not invite us.  We took the hint and drove an hour back, after our 15 minute tour, and made lunch.

I am not upset about any of the content, it just is really awkward.  He seemed like he brought it up because he was upset with my wife.  My wife seemed really degraded after we left.  My wife is not expecting an inheritance from him.  He left my wife's mother when she was young.  He really wasn't around much.  She spends a lot of energy trying to make him love her.  I know we will spend a lot of time with him.  This will come up again, how can I handle the inheritance issue.  It just seems awkward to come up, and it has come up before.
He's sounds very bitter for some reason. Who did he go to lunch with? Could your wife talk to them to try and fish for some info? 

I think your handling these conversations right with saying things like "can't take it with you" but if he does carry on, you or your wife will have to say something. It's disrespectful and I imagine very hurtful. 

Good luck. 
You have two young kids. It was a lot to ask you to move him in and you guys went anyways. He said something like a prick.
He just got out of a previous relationship.  His ex-ran into some medical issues, so he left her.  His new wife has two 30 year old children that live with her.  We are not that close to them.  We had the daughter at our wedding, but it doesn't seem like a likely source of info.

Also what could I say when I talk to him about it.  I don't mind talking to him about it, I just don't want to come off aggressive or crass. 
         So here goes. I dont know if anyone will even look at this but things in my family are not going too well right now. There have always been small issues between my parents that caused them to fight but this time it seems to be a big issue. 
         My parents are originally from India, where the woman in the family is not expected to work and provide for the family, and that's the ideology my mom followed after we moved to america. However, after we bought a larger house, my dad felt as if he was doing an unproportional amount of work since he would wake up early and sleep late as a consultant to a big IT firm while my mom would essentially lounge around. Along with increased mortgage and my college tuition to pay, he felt that it would only be right if my mother helped out financially by getting a job as well.
            He has been asking her to get a job for a couple months now, but only recently has he been more insistent that she do so. It has gotten to a point that whenever he brings up the idea of working, my mother doesnt even talk to him; this in turn angers him quite a bit. This has led to a series of fights, mostly verbal but sometimes physical. I am the only one that can talk to her and when asked about her reluctancy to work she says that she feels too old(shes 40), she just doesnt want to work, and is scared to talk to people due to her english being subpar. But with financial times being tough, she needs to work. 
         She has an interview for a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in which she would work in the manufacturing aspect for. She simply refuses to attend, and it seems as if my dad might snap any second. There have already been talks about a divorce, which would destroy the family. 
         How can I possibly help in this situation?
Hi! I don't know where to start...

TL;DR

My family is having an intervention for my niece, because they feel she has

1) no direction in life

2) doesn't pay rent

3) has become emotionally distanced

Sounds typical, but it's not.

She is 23 yo and currently lives with my mom and dad. She had a fairly rough life and has been moving around a lot, foster care and so on. Her mother is schizophrenic, they have no contact, and her father is a sociopath.

My brother and I both inherited it from dad, who is a WW2 survivor and the worst person to be giving out advice or handling other people's emotions and issues. My mom's ok but not exactly Sigmund Freud.

Me and my niece have an awesome relationship, she is like my little sister and I love her to pieces. She has a job and works from noon to evening 6 times a week, she doesn't make much but has told me she does it so she doesn't have to hang out with my family. Which I can totally respect.

However, she has zero ambition and is unable to complete the most mundane tasks (paying bills et c). She is suffering from depression and told us last year she was suicidal.

My parents are having issues with her because she refuses to pay rent (lies about it), and has recently become emotionally distant from them.

She loathes her father and hasn't spoken to him in a month and a half even though we all live in the same city. I can sympathize on that account too.

This Sunday we're having a family intervention, which I think is both necessary and inevitable because they do have some points, but it's going to be like running a gauntlet through a mine field. It could easily end up making everything worse.

So I need advice, any advice, even suggestions or tips for other subs, resources or whatever, so that I can make my presence as conducive to a positive outcome as possible.

I deeply appreciate any help.

I feel like if my family was having an intervention for me, I wouldn't want them to keep attacking me with things without sympathizing for me as well. I'm not saying the things she did were right, but if my family were going to gang up on me, I would want at least one of them to try and see things from my perspective and try and work a solution from there.
Thanks for the reply. Yeah that would definitely be my part. I didn't get any advice from anyone else unfortunately, but I did check out a few YouTube clips on how to perform interventions in general and they had amazing tips.

Also unfortunately, one of them was not to have one like this. It's headed for disaster, but I'll try to disarm the situation as best I can. 
My dad was 72 and lived a long and happy life, he made plenty of money, was genius level intelligent, and owned his own business and had tons of freedom. Everyone around him loved him and people hung on his every word when he had something to share. In short, he had a life that many dreamed of so I am happy that he got to spend his life the way he did and while I miss him dearly I am thankful for the time we were able to spend together, not all people get to have both parents into their thirties.

My mother, though, is having a tough time and I don't know if she is acting the way most women would or if she is going overboard because I have zero experience with loss prior to this. They were together 40 years and ran a business together, played golf together, and were generally together 24/7. When they weren't together they were "checking in" with each other constantly. She's devastated and that's to be expected but it's starting to get to the point where her life is being totally consumed by the loss. She's planning a party in his honor which is fine, but she will come in the office (I'm in the business as well) and spend 6-8 hours getting nothing done but crying, talking on the phone, and asking me about the party and what I want to get done. For a few days I was able to humor her and indulge and provide all the support she needed, but I've let too much work slide by and with my dad gone my workload has doubled now. I am shutting my door to get work done and I'm letting it accumulate faster than I'm finishing it, I have told her I need to focus and she goes away and cries for 20 minutes because I won't be there for her then comes back and wants to talk again. She's doing this with our two employees as well.

I am focused on growing my parent's business and helping my mom have long term security financially, if I let her distract me for the entire day I will eventually erode our business so I know that the best thing for her is to get to work (she's got a bulk of the responsibility) and to let me get things done as well. I just can't find a way to get the message across to her without sounding like a totally insensitive ass.

I would love to hear some stories about situations like this and how you handled it that worked, in other words share your tips with me or provide some insight. It's a difficult thing to balance and I'm having a hard time finding a way.
I am  twiced widowed myself....I've lost 2husbands in 10 yrs....in my experience the first yr we are in such a fog and in so much grief it's very hard to fiction ...there are stages of that we go through...the first is denial then anger then the processing part..after I lost my first husband I was always trying to  fill a void and did many crazy silly things that now  looking back I just shake my head at..in the second is when it really hits you and the greif is deeper than the first yr...when I lost my second husband it was even harder for me to recover from as I knew all too well the grieving process what to expect...the first time around I was really a list soul trying to find my way and purpose in life and refunding myself....the second time around I've lost myself in work....
There are support groups either in your town or online that are very helpful..... there was one at one time yrs ago that I belong too that we had something called a "boat" didn't matter what time of day or night it was you would log in and say I'm getting in the boat as I need to rest the members there would give incouragement to go on help to uplift you and basically give you a time to greif then when you we're ready you'd be ready to come out and get back to life.....
I'm so very sorry for your lost....



I'm very sorry for your loss. However if you can't properly be there to support your Mum (understand so, your supporting elsewhere by focusing on security) refer her to a professional. A therapist or a grief counsellor. Not only are they going to be able to listen but they can offer her coping strategies. This is the worst thing that will ever happen to her, her life has literally flipped on its head. She just needs to learn how to get back up. She'll never be the same but the right help will make it easier.
Thanks! I think she would be pretty opposed to support groups and I'm almost afraid to bring it up, right now I'm trying to encourage her to bring her dog in to the office just so she has some company on the car ride in (and something to manage to keep her mind occupied).
Thanks for the feedback!
My brother and his wife are coming oversees for my wedding. They took three weeks for the trip, but they only planned four days with us. The rest of the time they are touring Europe. Am I wrong to have my feelings hurt? It's the first and maybe only time they are coming to Europe, but when I make the trip home, I make sure to spend all the time I have with them and the rest of the family. They asked my opinion and I advised against a big tour. They planned it anyway because it's their only chance to cross it off their bucket list. Now I told my brother that my feelings are hurt, and he seems to think I don't understand how hard it is for them to make this trip. Honestly, I understand more than he does, because I have made it three times now to see them. I didn't turn it into a big US tour for myself. The region where we are marrying is incredibly beautiful and I wanted to show it to them, but now there is no time for that. He is actually spending more money to spend more time away from us in the most touristy cities in Europe. He said he thought we would be on a honeymoon after the wedding, but he never asked and we never said we planned a honeymoon. We didn't. We wanted to spend the time with my family. 

I'm just editing here to say, yeah, I am probably being too sensitive. I am pregnant and super hormonal. I am just happy they are coming and I will focus on that. I can't deny them their chance to do something they really want to do. I miss them, but I am the one who moved away. 
You are not wrong to be upset because you can't help how you feel. It is even worse when you are pregnant (I have been there!). That said, yes, it is wrong to expect them to dedicate the whole trip to spending time with you. It sounds like it is an expensive trip and they are using your wedding as a push to also do some things they really want to do and would otherwise not have the chance to do. Four days is a decent amount of time and it isn't like they are blowing you off. What you choose to do with your.vacation and your time is up to you. This is up to them. It sounds like they are making the most of the trip. 

You sound like you miss them and being pregnant and hormonal you want to be close to your family right now. That is only natural. Believe me, I understand. My family is good at pushing me aside and doing what they please when I need them. When they help they really help and when they don't it is when I really need them because I don't ask for help and support a lot. I would try to see this from their point of view. it is okay to be a little disappointed, but try to see it as them getting the most oUT of this trip.
Remember that his wife had some input into their plans also.
Remember when you go 'back home' you already have been there and so CAN devote all   your time to visiting. There is no reason for you to do  a big U.S. tour!

This may be the only time your brother and his wife have this opportunity and I think if you look at it from their perspective you might understand a bit more.

I get how you are feeling but you have to sometimes step inside someone else's shoes. 

I don't want to blame your feelings on your pregnancy but as a mother I DO know we are often much more sensitive then.
And here's a  tip you might think untrue, but often, once our visitors are there for more than 4 or 5 days, like fish, they begin to stink.

I'd say enjoy them while you have them, try to understand their pov, and stay close to your sibling. Family is so important!

Finally, you never know what the future holds. They may decide they're sick of being touristas and come back to spend more time with you.

Whatever their choice, be happy for them, as they are for you. 
I'm 36 and I have never feel comfortable hanging out with my family. Holidays gathering, special occasions, weddings...etc. Don't get me wrong, they are all very nice people, but I don't really have anything in common with any of them. And every time when all of them meet up, I don't look forward to it at all. It just stresses me out even just the thought of me needing to show up. How do you guys deal with it? It's like a house chore that I'm not looking forward to doing. 
I also feel uncomfortable being around family, I was always the black sheep in the family. 

Really no way around it...
Wine usually does the trick 
I guess just suck it up and feel uncomfortable for a few hours. 
Me too, Agentchow!  But then I realize how thankful I am not to be like them and count my blessings!
I always show up high.
Queue anxiety and paranoia :)
Let me start off my saying this is a throwaway, and this is a positive post! I'm not sure if this is the right place for this post, but I'm just hoping someone can understand how I'm feeling. 

I'm 24 and my brother is 22, graduating from college next week. I wanted to spend time with him before he walks so I visited him right after work this weekend at school one last time. My brother and I have a really solid relationship. We each do our own thing but make sure to stay in contact and keep one another updated on what's happening in life. 

He's moving right into NYC after graduation and has a full-time job lined up and I couldn't be more proud of him and how hard he's worked so far. This weekend has been a blast and I really love hanging out with him. It's super bittersweet because it's always awesome to see him and exciting when I do, but eventually my final day/hours with him start to creep up (right now) and it gets me pretty upset because of how much I miss having him around. It's just the idea and feeling of having him around, knowing he's at home and close by to hang out with even if we just sort of sit around. It's not like I feel lonely or anything, but just something about knowing my brother is around is really nice to me. 

I know this is just the progression life and we are both adults now, but it feels weird to think he's going to permanently be 3 hours away from me and I'm not sure when I'll get to see him next. I'm just really thankful for our relationship and cherish the time we get to spend together nowadays. I know that I'm missing him for good reasons and things could always be worse! Like I said, we've always done our own things so I'm happy he's happy and always glad when I can see how he's doing. Plus, 3 hours is nothing compared to cross country. 
Technology has made keeping close easier than ever thankfully. It takes effort and time, but you can maintain that relationship. It never gets easier, believe me. It's amazing sometimes to thing it's been more than a decade since I've seen some people who used to be so close to me.

Congrats for your brother on his success and best of luck!
This is absolutely the place to post this and I appreciate you sharing it. I hope you told your brotheresume how proud you are of him. It can be hard living away from relatives. As /u/Arclite meantioned, technology is great. Phone calles, text, face time, theye five us the opportunity to stay connected. You see each other when you can and enjoy the time when it happens. Your brother sounds lucky to have you. I live 2 hours away from my parents and sister and I see them a lot. Long weekends, holidays, etc., are going to be great times to get together. Change is hard so be forgiving of yourself if you are a little emotional. It will take time to adjust, but you will get there :)
I hope this doesn't turn into a rant.   But I'm seriously wondering how everyone else manages their family life without feeling like someone is getting the short end of it. 
Background 
Me (31f) 
hubs (32m) 
kid (18mos f) 
Married 8 years. Together 11 years. Planned for the baby making to start at age 30.  Right on track. 
Ever since we've had her I feel like I do 75% of everything. We both work.  But I get her ready for daycare. Drop her off. Pick her up. Whoever gets home first starts dinner. Oh yeah and we just had a financial bottoming out which included eviction and a car repossession so home is at my father's house with my teenage brother and 25 year old developmentally disabled sister. So the stress level is high. Back to our family... We both have to work some on the weekends. Me especially because with the whole moving thing we had to start daycare and on short notice we found a great place but with craptastic hours. So I cannot work less than 40 but my daycare, driving distance etc makes my days 7 hrs on the job. Being we're in financial hell my husband takes all the overtime he can get. And he knows my job has been historically flexible so if he gets home at 730 at night he thinks it's cool that I go back in at 800. Which by my own standards and the standards for most at my work it's really not.  Sometimes I have to run around for work and yes I've taken the baby before, but it would be done faster and easier if I didn't have to get her ready, bags packed. Because taking a toddler out involves doomsday type prepping.  I do all the grocery shopping. I do all the cleaning except laundry he does laundry 80% of the time. But just wash and dry and throw in a "clean"  pile. Better than nothing. I cook 6/7 meals a week. I tell him it's not fair and he says he works over 50hrs and he'll start keeping a tally every time he does something. I can't help but to think I'm angry underneath all the who does what... Because I blame him for our financial issues. Like totally blame. He's always been the chivalrous attitude of the man takes care of the family thing... But he didn't. And now we're here.

But does anyone ever feel like the household and children related tasks are equal?
Not a parent here but I feel like there are very few families in which both parents share tasks equally. Honestly, keeping track or "tallies" of what either of you do will just make resentment worse. Is he sitting at home doing nothing while you work your butt off getting house work done or does he come home, eat dinner, and basically just go to bed? Have you thought of possibly asking him to specifically do something? "I need you to do this pile of laundry this weekend." Or something?

Or, if you want everything to be equal, make a list of the chores for the week and split it down the middle. Give yourself some and him some and they need to be done by the end of the week. I just think it'll be difficult for everything to be equal.
Even before the kids, it was never equal with my husband and I. Add in the twenty four hour job of raising kids, the increased chores, the extra hours at work, and his seemingly never ending homework, and it can't possibly be fair. 

I would be super interested to hear from anyone who actually has their tasks split down the middle. As it is, the breakdown at my house is (my numbers first): chores 85/15 kids 50/50 finances 0/100 cars 0/100 cooking 20/80. 

I work full time and watch the kids from the minute i get home until bedtime. I bathe them, nag about teeth brushing/chores, and get them out of the house for some exercise. He watches the toddler all day except the couple hours per week he is in classes. Somehow he gets homework done while watching her, so I'm not sure how much he does well at either.

Usually things are better, but he seems to have become welded to his computer this last year. I'm hoping there is some sort of surgery or antibiotic to help him after graduation.
I think it bothers me most when he's sitting spaced out on the cell phone "watching our daughter" while I'm cleaning the kitchen, packing lunches, setting out clothes for the next morning. And yeah I think it's a good suggestion to specify my requests. It drives me nuts when there's dishes out, dirty clothes in the hall and the toys spread out and he asks what do you want me to do while he slurps a yogurt and leaves the container on the book shelf. I want to scream be a decent semi clean human being that is living in someone else's house right now. I either need to tell him what exactly I'm looking for or... Ugh, I don't even know. Thanks for the responses. 
Being the "good kid" sucks. I'm sure all the other siblings think it's so nice not to worry because you don't do anything wrong. Which is just a loaf of shit. 

Being the *Good One* has left me so angry, spiteful and ashamed. I can't tell you what it's like walking around wondering if one brother has decided sobaxone isn't enough today. Or the other one might decide that drinking at on his way home from work will help him get to oblivion before the usual time. Or that the only other one of you is enables this shit behavior so much that you don't even need to wonder where it started from.

I am so fed up with the selfishness. How am I the one being "judgmental" when one of my brothers came into MY WORK HIGH, without shame acting like a moron in front of not only my co-workers but also my boss?! How is it I am the lazy one when my alcoholic brother does nothing but drink and drink and drink. 

Why do I have to be the one to tell our mother her son's are LYING TO HER FACE and arent sober. Everyone turns a blind eye to this and I get grief for not. 

It hurts. Because they don't remember my birthday. And it hurts that maybe I'm having a shit day but it always is overshadowed by someone elses mess. 

Anyway just needed to rant. Thanks.
You need to move at least 4 hours away.
I'm 16/m.

I don't even know where to begin with this.

I've never met my bio dad--he went to prison for selling drugs before my identical twin brother and I were born, and we've never met him.

We grew up in a house with our mom, who was 14 when we were born, grandma(now dead), and our mom's younger brother, who we call our Dad and who I'll refer to that way from here on out. (He's legally our dad now anyway.)

When we were ten, our grandma died, and our mom moved into another house with her boyfriend. He was really poor, and there was literally nowhere for us to sleep but in bed with them or the hard uncarpeted floor. We got too big to be doing that and hated his bed because he smoked. He was an asshole and life sucked there. 

My brother got injured while swimming one day and almost drowned. I don't know why, but our mom refused medical care for him. Our dad/uncle got pissed off and took him to the doctor, and then he wouldn't bring him back home. He negotiated with our mom and lawyers and got himself legally listed as our father. 

Our dad/uncle was living in a college apartment at the time and could only take my brother to live with him since he was already there.

Our dad is still pretty poor considering the circumstances. He's in graduate school and talks about how expensive and time consuming it is. But he's a way better parent than my mom. My brother is always calm and mature, and he's a straight A student who is in every club while I'm a fuckup who drinks and smokes weed while barely passing.

My mom yells at me all the time. I've told her I wanted to kill myself if I couldn't go live with my dad, and she just says to grow up.

She meets new boyfriends all the time and tells me they will be my step dad after like one night with them. And she's pregnant from a guy who beats her, but it's OK because she loves him!

I've told my dad how I feel, and he got me into counseling and argued with my mom, but he can't have me live with him right now. I'm so fed up with life and how unfair it is. My brother gets to be happy and surrounded by successful, intelligent adults who have their shit together while I'm stuck with my mom who thinks a new boyfriend, no matter how much of a loser he is, solves everything.

Everyone I talk to says it's all on me to catch up and be successful like him. Maybe that's true, but I don't even know how. I do all my homework with my brother, who goes to a different school now, and I'll understand how to solve all the problems and then get like a C on the test when it comes. It's completely demoralizing. He says I could have test anxiety or some shit. My mom won't even take me to the doctor for legitimate illnesses without a fight. No way she's going to do anything about test anxiety.
There's a lot to say here.

Environmental factors of growing up are unfortunately completely out of our control, for the most part.  It's still good to be mindful of them and brainstorm how to improve your situation, but sometimes that can be frustrating at sixteen years old.  Soon, perhaps very soon, you'll be finishing up high school and moving out.

What are your plans after that?  What kind of things do you enjoy, what kind of things do you want to pursue in life, what kind of impact do you want to leave?  And if you see yourself as worthless, what people can you help before you go (we all eventually pass, that's how I started thinking about it, but if there's even one good thing that you can do then that's something).  To be perfectly honest, I had negative thoughts about myself around that age as well - it's probably more common than people admit - but I thought that I'd wait a few years and see what happens.  I also had someone tell me don't do it - PROMISE ME YOU WON'T DO IT - and that made a big impact on me (I don't know how they knew what I was thinking).  That impact may be somewhat lessened online, but it's just as important that you know that.

A few years came, and the pains lessened for me, slowly but surely.  It gets better.  A few things I've learned... never be too proud to pass up on the small things.  We're all good at different things - but the really important things, no matter how trite or silly it sounds, is what is inside a person.  Their approach and outlook to life.  Happiness isn't in success... there's some wisdom there... it's hidden in how we relate to ourselves and others.  We all have the potential for so much good and so much bad, strive even against reason for the good.
That's a crappy situation you're in. Is there a good reason why you can't live with your dad and brother? If it's financial, realize that at 16 you do have a choice in where to live legally, and that if a judge orders you to live with your dad, he can apply for assistance to make ends meet. You can also get a job and earn your share, so to speak. It's unfair if your brother doesn't have to do that as well, but surely it's better than the alternative of living with your degenerate mom?

Your parents are probably well meaning and love you, but essentially what they've done is played favorites by giving your brother a far superior situation than you. 

I want you to seriously talk to both of them and bring up that point.
You're 16. Things will get better when you are out of the house. Go hug your brother today, because he'll wish you did more if you commit suicide.

If you feel suicidal this website can help. They have a number and you can call any time day or night. Please, please call them if you need them.

It sucks that your brother is in a more stable place than you and I understand wanting that. The truth of the situation is you may be stuck where you are. The only way things are going to get better is if you make them better. You can't change that you live with your mom, but you can make better decisions for yourself. You will only turn out like your dad if you believe you are going to. You can change that. Stop smoking weed. Don't drink. Do your homework and study. Your brother doesn't get straight A's by doing nothing. You can get your grades up. Don't expect change to happen over night. It is gradual. And don't compare yourself to your brother. You are your own person. The grass always looks greener on the other side. Focus on your life and your goals. Focus on one problem athat a time and work on it. Once you fix oneverything thing you will see you can do more.

If you ever want to talk, I am here any time.

It's two boxes crudely duck-tapped together, with a hamper duck taped over a hole made in the top for lighting.
One of the soldiers can be 'wound up' from inside the house.
The box in front is a doorway, with a open-able(But delicate) door.
There's a open-able window on the side, that can be fitted with a [not shown] tin to make a makeshift cubby.
He seems to love it!
The little  thing hanging on the front box is the cover of the tin.
Also I'm all out of ducktape, can't add a better shelf or more boxes...
This is so awesome! 
Its really easy to make through. Just have some good box tape or duct tape, box cutter, scissors(most just for cutting tape ;-;, damn you tape)and a pen or pencil. You could also use a ruler for it, but I just used my own loosely sketched uneven lines for it.

Takes about a hour and a half, depends on how much you plan on putting in.

Protip: Unless you want duct-tape hinges on a hinged door, cut- up, right(or left), down; leave one of the two sides un cut. Natural Hinges. If it's too stiff, or you want some realism, cut 3 rectangles out of the edge of the door.

Mom and dad have always had a rocky relationship; on and off, up and down. It's messy and confusing for everyone. But for the past 6 years or so it has only gotten worse and worse. Dad is a 38 year old man baby who relies on mom to live, since she is the only one working, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. The man doesn't even make doctors appointments until he is forced to. He is a very manipulative person when it comes to his relationship with mom and I. He will threaten to take his own life if mom tries to break up with him. He has also threatened to move away from us (he said he would live in his van on the streets, since he has no family to live with and no money to rent a hotel room), which wouldn't have been a problem if he didn't have two other kids that cared for him. The sad part is, when dad does these things, him, and my brothers, will put the blame on mom for not keeping him adequately happy every second of the day. So mom is in an obligated relationship with my father. She is clearly very unhappy, but puts her sons' feelings ahead of hers, and keeps dad around. I truly do not know what to do, since I am unable to step in and speak for mom, as this is their relationship, after all. But it is affecting me as well, since dad had stated already on several occasions that he hates me, and treats me like I'm an unwanted guest in the house. 
Because of all this, mom does not like when I leave the house for longer periods of time, as I am her "rock," and when I am gone she has a hard time dealing with the emotional and manipulative abuse from my father. I am afraid that she will be stuck with him until my brothers are old/mature enough to realize that daddy isn't a good person to be around, or, even worse, that my brothers will never see the evil in our father as he has manipulated and brainwashed them since the day they were born into thinking that he's never wrong.

tl;dr: my dad is a manipulative, selfish man whom mom and I are obligated to stay with. How do I go about removing this toxic person out of my life without ruining anyone else's?
Hi,

I know what it eels like to have a manipulative father. It's fucking horrible. I felt trapped, and unable to express how I felt by trying to keep the peace all of the time.

The fact that your dad is threatening to take his own life if your mother leaves is a form of domestic abuse. And your mum shouldn't have to go through that... so she should get up and leave. Your dad sounds like a complete incompetent idiot to be honest... a man at the age of 38 shouldn't rely on anyone to live, and definitely not put to that pressure on your mother...

A good idea would be to check any local domestic abuse help that is more than likely to help you out. And make sure that your mother wants to leave. If she truly wants to... then she should go for it. She deserves to be selfish and put her needs first as she's had to deal with your manipulative father for so long.

If your mother doesn't want to leave and you don't want to tolerate your father anymore.... then move out (if you're old enough?). Or maybe you could ask for help from family/friends? Like staying at their house for a while?


I just booked the Harry Potter studio tour for me and my sister. I'm 21 (will be 22 by the time we go) and she is 12 and both from Scotland. She's like me; she loves to read books, is quiet and likes to lock herself away in her room when reading.

She doesn't have any idea. And I'm going to tell her tomorrow on Christmas day! She will be so happy. And I will be so happy that she is happy. I love her with all of my heart.

I just wanted people to know how much I love my sister, even if this doesn't seem like a huge gesture to you!
That is awesome! I hope you two have the best time :)
My husband and I purchased a home the next cul-de-sac over from his brother and his brother's wife. They, as well as my husband's parents, pop by our house whenever they take a walk around the block or need something. It usually comes without warning, and I am so irritated! A phone call or text would be nice, especially because I am typically busy doing something and don't want their kids running around my house, making messes and screwing with the dog! I am an introvert and territorial over my space. Anyone else have a similar experience?
Lock your door and ignore the bell. I have, when my ILs have 'dropped by'. They complained to Husband, who just asked if they'd called ahead and when they admitted that they had not he said they needed to, and that a car in the garage doesn't mean I'm home. They're out walking, surely I could be, too.
They are your husband's family, so having him talk to them may help. He needs to explain. That they need to call or text before coming over. Unfortunately, some people don't listen because they don't see it as a big deal. You can try explaining yourself, but it may be hard to keep them out without resorting to not answering the door.
This has happened to me precisely zero times in my life. Probably because people know that I won't tolerate it.
I spend a lot of time fantasizing about a life other than mine. I wish wasnt spanish. I wish my mom spoke English. I wish my parents were more familiar with American culture. I wish my mom wasn't so obnoxiously loud even with her regular speaking voice. I wish I wouldn't be judged for the music I listen to and shows I watch because I'll go to hell. I just want to live like a regular white suburban family. Where the mom has a sweet endearing voice. Kind of like that 70s show. Or Modern Family. Everything about my family gives me anxiety.
No one has the perfect family. It is normal to feel like you are different and to want things to be different. The truth is you aren't going to get them to change. They are who they are and the sooner you can accept that the happier you will be. You don't have to agree with them, but learning how to tolerate them will make you a lot happier in the long run.
Everyone fantasizes about having a different set of circumstances in their life. It's normal.

Those shows are just completely unrealistic vehicles used to tell funny and entertaining stories so that people will watch and advertisers will give the networks money. The stories are little tiny glimpses in to the best slices of those TV families lives. You don't see the bad times unless it's part of the story line. Don't compare your life to television or the movies.

Be grateful you have a mother who is alive and in your life. Learn to love what is different or grating about others to you. It's easier said than done but it's a big part of growing up.
Truth
Not sure if this the right place to put this but here goes.I need advice and don't know what to do. I am 16 and my parents have been divorced since I was 8. I stay with my dad every other weekend and we always have a good time together. Last weekend I was staying at his place and he had to go out for the morning and I started snooping around, I know it was wrong and Now I really wish I didn't. In a drawer beside his bed I found some dirty magazines and as I was going through them I found a stack of pictures of me. A bunch were of me sun tanning in his backyard in my bikini  taken from the 2nd floor window. Some were all of me and others were close ups of different parts.There was also a picture of me and my friends at the beach he must of taken gotten off my phone and also picture that I had given him of me at a school formal. 
I am freaked out he has these in that drawer , but Ican't tell anyone. My mom would go nuts if I told her and would try to make a huge deal and even go to a lawyer or worse. I love my dad and he has never done anything inappropriate to me and up to Saturday everything was great between us. I am suppose to spend from Christmas to New Years with him but now I feel queasy about being there and don't know what to do.
You need to tell your mom. That is not normal. Your mom will be upset because this is upsetting, but that is why you need to tell her. She needs to know and to take action. I know this your dad, but that does not make this okay. You are not equipped to handle this and that is why your mom needs to know. You need to be safe and this is not safe.
Does anyone else have experience or advice about fostering children?
First off, thank you for becoming a foster parent. It isn't an easy thing to do, but it is so important. I have not foster children, but my parents did have a foster son.

Buy some clothes. These kids probably don't have a lot. There are great second hand stores, like Once Upon A Child, that sell gently used clothes for good prices. I get a lot of clothes for my kids there. 

Some kids horde food. Part of it is hunger. Part of it is the fear they will not have food in the future and part of it is a control issue. Be patient with them. Make sure they have access to food whenever they want it and reassure them it is okay for them to do so.

Use the services that CPS makes available to you. They are there for a reason they have these programs. 

If you have any dealings with the biological parents, keep a log of date, time, and how the interaction went. If they have visitation, let them use a CPS visiter room. I recommend against letting them in turn home. Some people get bitter and convince themselves that you are the problem and that you are trying to steal their child. They can be unstable. Keep safe. If they harass you, keep driving by your home, phone calls, etc., report it to the caseworker every time and keep the info (including your interaction with the case worker) in your log book.

Consider therapy for yourself. It can be difficult to see what these kids have gone through. You may have the same child/children for a while or they may end up back with their parents, who may or may not be ready to be decent parents. Having to give a child back can hurt very much, and there isn't always much you can do. Having a safe place to talk about these feeling is always a good idea.

Best of luck. Again, thank you for what they are doing.
Came to say you guys are awesome and I envy your ability to do this! Good for you. 
thanks for the suggestions..
Any time :)
My poor wife is 36 weeks pregnant, high risk and just stuck here waiting on her surgery.  She happily hosts Bunco regularly and has hosted several baby showers for her friends this year.  I just asked and discovered that NO ONE is planning anything for HER!  When I asked her Bunco group that she is still having come this week about doing something, several of the women suddenly "can't make it".  I wish I could fix it for her!  She is too stressed out to admit it, but I know her heart is broken. With friends like these, who needs enemies.  😞
Fuck them! Sorry to be blunt, but they sound awful. I would talk to family and see if you can't arrange something for her. If not, maybe you can  do a little something. 
Yeah screw em. I never once had a baby shower for any of my kids yet had plenty for other people. Lived in Japan for 7 years on hubby's military orders and NO family came to see me. What I suggest YOU do is throw her a mini baby shower. Give her a box filled with some lady things like lotion and a home manicure set, write her a love letter, throw some confetti in and other fun things. What I can say as someone who has been dicked over by friends a lot is I am VERY close to my husband because of how he tries so hard to make up for it! Hope all goes well with her delivery and good luck to you both!
Pretty much what I told her!  Unfortunately, my job moved us about 2000 miles from family.  She's w complained, but she's obviously hurt and emotional so I just feel really bad.
Okay, so I'm sure you can organize something if you have the time. Some ideas for a special day:

* Can your family buy vouchers online for her from the shops close to you? They can email them to you and you can print it and hand it to her (or just show her the emails)
* Get THE FAMILY to write little letters (also via email). They can write things they hope for baby or say they are sorry they can't be there.
* If at least one or two friends are interested to support her, let them be there.
I'm 14 now. I've been living with my aunt for the past couple of years but now she's getting married and her husband made it clear that he doesn't want me around. Before that, I was living with my dad until he moved away and decided I was too much trouble to be with, I guess. My mom is not around either, I'm not sure where she is... 

I don't have any other family, at least willing to take me in for all I know and if I can't figure this out, I'll probably end up in some foster home or something. Been there, done that, not willing to repeat the experience. 

I think my dad has my legal custody, so I know that I have to get his signature to become emancipated, which he'll gladly give, but I'm not sure if I'm old enough. I already work part time, and I make enough to carry my own weight and I have lived by myself before, so, I'm not really scared about moving away. In fact I prefer it that way, it beats staying with my aunt and the prick she's marrying. 

Does anybody know at what age can I be emancipated? If not, is there anything else I can do?
You should ask /r/legaladvice for the legal issues. 14 is very young. I am pretty sure you can't be emancipated before the age of 16. This is not something you should have ti worry about. Have you talked to your aunt? Has she said anything about this? If not you should tell her you are concerned  about what is going to happen to you after she gets married. If she gives up custody of you to be with this man it is a pretty awful thing to do. I am sorry you don't have stable people in your life. I understand foster care isn't great, but it may be your only option.
This is a horrible situation, a 14 year old should not have to go through this. But I don't think legally you'll be allowed to live alone.
thank you, and no my aunt has given me until the rest of the year to figure out where can I go, otherwise, she'll come up with her own solution (which according to experience is some foster home). Even tracking down my dad and forcing myself onto him is better than foster home.
Is it possible to find a group home? That may be slightly better. I am sorry your aunt is doing this. It is an awful thing to do. I wish I had a good solution for you. I have kids and it breaks my heart to see people cast aside a child for their own selfish desirss. You seem wise beyond your yrats, mist likely out of necessity. I am sorry that you have had to grow up so fast. 

I am here any time you need to talk. If it's okay I would like to know how things work out for you. I am worried about you.
Please don't be worried, I'll be fine, I'm always fine. But thank you for your concern.
Can I ask you a question? I have a friend from work, he's 19, maybe even 20. Would it be possible for him to take my legal guardianship if we're not related? I would still pay rent to him and be more like a roommate, but would he be able to sign for school papers and legal documents? Because my school asks a lot of questions and if I were to stay without a legal guardian they'd find out within a couple days and last thing I'll ever do is drop out.
I wish I could answer that, but I am not sure. I would imagine it would be difficult. Ask /r/legaladvice may have more information for you. The problem is they want to make sure you are with a responsible adult, not a roomate. You shouldn't have to take care of yourself. Someone should be helping to take care of you. You need a social worker to help you figure this stuff out now before you have to move. S/he can help you go over your options and figure out a good situation for you.
Thank you, I will. To be honest I don't search for somebody to take care of me, I gave up on that years ago. Plus, I can take care of myself just fine, all I really need is an adult to sign my school documents. Again, thank you very much for your time and advice.
I had a VERY rough childhood. My dad was a very controlling and verbally abusive alcoholic. I have Asperger's Syndrome and my dad used to call me horrible names and heap TONS of verbal abuse on me whenever I committed even the most minor of social faux pas when I was a kid. I was never told that I was smart or beautiful. My dad expected absolute perfection and if I didn't live up to what he wanted, I was made to feel like I was worthless. He would also verbally abuse my mom pretty badly too. My dad also had trouble keeping a job because of his addiction so my family lived in poverty for most of my childhood.

Due to the fact that I never received any positive male attention while I was growing up, I fell for the first guy who said nice things to me. I married my first husband at age 20 as a means of escaping my chaotic home life. My first husband was extremely abusive to me and I filed for divorce at age 26 and returned to my hometown.

When I came back home, my dad (whom my mom had finally wised up and divorced) began trying to control my life. I quickly found work as a truck driver and my dad kept threatening to call the DMV and tell them that I was "too crazy" to have a CDL unless I completely signed my paychecks over to him and allowed him to give me an allowance. Soon after, I fell in love with and quickly moved in with a crusty old Air Force Sergeant named Carl who was six years my senior and would have none of my dad's garbage. My dad ended up hounding Carl with wanting to schedule a meeting with him so he could tell Carl that I was "too dysfunctional" to make a good wife. My dad's aim was to have Carl dump me so my dad could again attempt to control me. It didn't work.

Carl and I were married 13 months and 13 days after we first met. By that time, my dad had taken to driving over to Carl's house at random times "just to check on us". He also began warning me not to get pregnant because if I did, he would "make me" have an abortion. Carl started putting in for every overseas assignment he could put in for just to get us away from my dad. Last fall we were sent to a location halfway around the world. My dad STILL tries to control us!

My dad has been making a series of bizarre phone calls to me trying to pressure me into leaving Carl and moving back to my hometown. Carl is the only child of well-off parents and they have decided to give us the family farm when he retires from the Air Force in a few years. My dad just got wind of this and called me yesterday morning throwing a hissy fit because we were not planning on returning to my hometown when Carl retires.

I recently learned that my dad is a compulsive liar. For years he claimed that he dropped out of high school to join the Army in 1974 and that he also served in the Air Force. Carl told me that my dad's story didn't make sense so we consulted with a friend who works cases of stolen military valor for help. Our friend filed a Freedom of Information Act request for my dad's military records. The records showed that my dad had joined in 1977 at the age of 19, NOT in 1974 at age 16 as he claimed. He also NEVER served in the Air Force and was discharged under less than honorable terms in 1981.

My dad also believes that the military has implanted "listening devices" in me and Carl's home and vehicles. He has also been spreading a rumor around our hometown that Carl is abusing me and that Carl's first sergeant is "making" me come back home. 

Basically, my dad is six shades of crazy! Does anyone have any tips for extracting myself from such a situation? I'm afraid that my dad is going to absolutely flip out once my husband and I delete him from our Facebook pages and block his number. I'm about to turn 30 and I don't want to spend the next decade of my life dealing with my dad's antics. The situation is starting to overwhelm me! What I have described is actually a small snippet of the crazy shit my dad does to try to sabotage my life. I could literally fill a book with the crazy stuff my dad has tried to do to control me! 
File a restraining order?
You need to contact a lawyer who can help you file an restraining order/order of protection. Your father is not just crazy, he is harassing you and needs to stop. You need to keep records of calls (when they happen and what they are about. If you can let it go to voicemail and you can save that, even better). Keep a record of when he tries to stop by, and save all texts and emails. Witness are a good thing too, people who would be willing to sign an afadavit (my spelling is likely off, sorry, I'm on my phone) that they have witnessed this harassment.

Do not contact him. Report him if he makes contact in any way once the retraining order is in place. Your father sounds mentally ill, unstable, and potentially violent. Don't tell him where you live or work, and don't tell people who will talk to him and get information about you. If you are worried about him calling your work, talk to your boss. Explain that you are in the process of getting a  restraining order  (or talk to then once you have it). Not only they likely understand, it will allow them to call the police and report him if he calls or shows up.

Best of luck. I am truly sorry for all you have been through. Don't let him make you feel like you have something wrong with you. He is the one who is the problem and has problems. You deserve to live a happy life away from this man.
It looks like you DO need to stop all contact with him. He is abusing you as an adult. Harassing you etc.

YOU are allowed to live a great life and don't have to take this from him. You don't. You don't have to live in fear of what he will say or do.

I think the below information is key. File a restraining order. Block him from your life. 

Will he go ballistic? Sure. But the key question you have to ask is "So what".

So what. So what if he goes ballistic? Once you have the restraining order he is not allowed to contact you.

look. He isn't your father. He is man who's sperm impregnated your mother. A father is loving and kind. And you DONT have to feel guilty for cutting out a negative, harassing and ABUSIVE person from your life.

If this was a friend, or an old boyfriend would you cut them out? If someone else was acting like this toward you would walk away?

And frankly, staying in touch with him COULD harm your marriage. WHY would you allow this man to harm the one great thing you have in your life? Sounds like your husband is a winner on all fronts and I'm glad you found him :)

Your dad brings nothing but misery. YOU deserve better. Don't think about his feelings. HE does NOT think about yours.........
How do you feel about it? For those of you who changed your mind, why did you?  And the hard question: do any of you regret having children?
I would say for myself I never really wanted kids and never was a kid person didn't care for others children.  I wasn't planning on having mine it happens tho I have a girl and a boy they are 11 months apart they are my whole world I would do anything for them and I couldn't imagine life without them. My feeling towards kids in general is still the same usually don't care for other people's kids once you have your own they break all the rules and you end up losing them more than life it's self :) 
My sister is 49. In 1999 she had a AVM burst, which caused her to have a stroke. this left her partially physically and mentally disabled. She had always lived with my mum and dad. Mum died in 2004, and dad died in 2013. When my dad was in his final days, my brother moved in with his new girlfriend, on the pretext of caring for them both.  So after my dad died, it transpired my brother had spent dads funeral expense money. This created a bit of a rift within the family. We had a family meeting in 2013, and i said i wanted my sister to move into sheltered accomadation. My brother and his girlfriend were adamant they wanted to look after her and stay in the house. i was outvoted and so it happened. Since then my brother has banned us all from the house and won't give us the telephone number so we can call my sister. We have to write to her to tell her when we are going to pick her up and take her out.  
Well, in the last 6 months particularly, she has changed dramatically. Her speech and walking has regressed horrifically, she is unclean, they no longer cook for her, she lives on microwave chips, she has no access to her own money, she has to stay in her room all day, they don't interact with her.
Yesterday we discovered she had a doctors appointment for her foot. My brother didn't bother taking her so she has been put back to the bottom of the line.  I have tried to speak to her support worker but she never returns my call.  We really don't have the room for her at my house but i will make room if it makes her safe. 
Any opinions welcome..i'm in the UK
If her case worker doesn't return your calls the call her supervisor and explain the situation. If s/he does notHong call the police. This seems like pretty clear neglect. 
I always knew I was adopted and met my birth family and love them! Anyway I tried contacting my birth father and I prepared myself for him already having a family since its been years. He said his family doesn't know about me and to leave him alone.... Part of me is wanting to keep trying to meet my 1/2 siblings and the other says leave him alone. Opinions?! 
I recently helped my best friend find her birth parents and birth family. It has been quite a roller coaster ride as everyone comes to grips with things. I also have two adopted cousins. 

That said, I'd leave him be. We don't get to have everything we want if the price is paid by someone else. 
Mine was a roller coaster as well! Thank you for the advice!

The charity we are raising money for
I went to get new glasses because my prescription changed. I was able to get a really good deal, $100 for frames and lenses. So I called my dad to tell him (because at the time I was in college broke and still on his health insurance plan).

His response was "ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? YOU SPENT HOW MUCH MONEY??? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING??? I just can't believe this." Then he hung up.

A half hour later I get a call from my sister. She evidently was there when I called my dad and she called to console me. She said, "Dad doesn't have any right to get mad at you for getting new glasses because he just bought me a new set of golf clubs and a golf bag."

Officially the black sheep. My life is a joke.

I'm sorry. I don't understand some people. All I can say is keep working to be completely independent from him and once you are you can choose not to deal with him at all. You don't choose your family and you don't have to put up with being treated poorly.
How many of you still have your great grand parents? I consider myself very lucky to have him, he's been the cornerstone of our family for so many years. He's getting old though, and it worries me. I know losing people is a part of life but I can't imagine life with out him.
I had both of my great grandparents alive until my early 20's. They were both 90. That side of my family has some pretty incredible longevity, which is amazing. My grandmother on that side is in her mid 70's and she is in amazing health. We are very lucky. 
Also, I though you guys might like these photos. I went to the shooting range with him today and had a blast! Hard to believe he's 93 and STILL a better shot than I am!

It's wonderful that you have great grandparents. Mine all died when I was younger. I had all four of my grandparents for a while, but lost my grandpa a little over two years ago. I miss him a lot. He was always there for me. I lost him four months after losing my oldest daughter (she had a fatal genetic disorder and lived six days). Part of me feels like that loss was too much for him because he couldn't do anything to make it better, and he was the kind of person who always wanted to fix problems for his loved ones. I now have a 17 month old little girl who is healthy and happy and a healthy little girl due in a few weeks. I really wish he'd gotten to meet them. He would have loved them so much. 

My husband lost his grandma a couple of weeks ago. She had Alzheimer's and she could even remember how to eat anymore. She was a nice lady and while it's sad she is gone I am happy she isn't suffering anymore. The last few weeks of her life she was confined to a bed and wasn't really lucid. She was able to tell my husband she loved him and I am grateful for that. We've lost a lot of people and have some many sad last memories. At least that is a beautiful one.
I haven't seen my dad since I was six and even then it was only like once every few months, if that. Growing up I had the mentality that "if he doesn't care then neither do I." I'm 24 now and I've known his address and phone number for a little over 3 years. For about the last 2 years I've really wanted to get in touch with him but I'm scared for his reaction. I'm afraid to give him a call and him say something like, "I don't have a daughter." or "I don't know what you're talking about." 
I'm not sure if the rejection again will fuck with my head, especially now since  I'm able to fully understand it. 
Reddit, if you've been in the same position or have any pieces of advice, please share. 
I've never been in this situation, so I can only give you advice that I think will help. First off, I think it can be helpful if you figure out what you want out of meeting your dad. Do you want a relationship with him? Do you want a conversation? What is the goal? It is very likely he is going to question what you want from him, so it can help to know.

Also, be prepared that he may not want anything to do with you. It's sad, but he hasn't been there for you. You may not get the explanation you are looking for. You may not find a man who didn't know how to reach out to you. You many not be met with kindness. It is something you have to be prepared for if you pursue contacting him.

He may be happy to hear from you. He may have not known how to approach you. He may have a different perspective of why he isn't in your life and it may not be something you want to hear. 

I wish I had better advice to give you, but again, I haven't been there. I will say that no matter what you are a complete person. Meeting him, who he is, doesn't change who you are. You have grown up without him in your life and if he continues to not be a part of your life you will still do just fine. Try to look at potentially having a relationship as a bonus, not something that you need. It's not fair that you have been put in this situation, but only you can decide what you want to do. You can't make this man to be a part of your life, but if you feel like this is something you need to do then you should do it. Best of luck :)
I am a dad with two daughters who left my life for many years. One was with a ex-wife who decided to move out of the country. The other was with a woman who moved across the country. We kept in touch through Facebook but it is not the same as a face to face relationship. Finally came the year where we were going to be reunited at last. First it was with my older daughter who moved out of country she was 16 at the time and ready to rebel! I hugged her and tried to talk with her but nothing I had to say intresred her finally I concocted an idea that I thought she would be interested in a treasure hunt with 11 legs one clue leading to the next and I spread them all over our little town. She really took to this and we started talking about the hunt. I guess she was only intrested in the memories that we could make together. I did this once a month for a year. Then came a good snow and I didn't want to get out in it but she did so I introduced her to geocacheing and now we hunt together. Next came my second daughter she was 13 and this was the first time we had ever met. When I saw her I gave her a big ol hug and she smiled. She was not rebellious at all instead she wanted answers. So I gave them to her . She wanted to hear them again and again as to be sure that was how it all happened. After a week of processing them she settled in and wanted to talk about everything. We got along great for a whole summer then she had to go back to her mom but, were still in touch and summer is almost here again. These are my experiences from my two older daughters I hope this helps you realize one thing important it takes time to get to know someone. I have four kids now and one grandson my oldest still wants me to make her custom hunts and adventure with her. My next daughter likes to talk, text, and facetime with me. I think we all have a great relationship and I hope you find what your looking for.
I'm glad you were able to establish a relationship with your girls :)
I just wanted to share my 6yr old sons answer to what we should plant in the garden? He said "Cheese trees" I said there are no such things. To which my son replied "Oh yeah then where do cheese logs come from?
that totally belongs in r/dadjokes!
That's adorable! 

A guy I work with had similar thoughts and I told him the only thing that changes is your reality.  Remember life in high school and life after?  Or life before your current job and life after?  (Or whatever may be age appropriate...before PS4 and now?)  Before new things happen you're filled with trepidation and sometimes fear of the unknown, but once things happen you adapt and it becomes your new reality.  

Granted with a child there is a lot more involved, but in my experience it's about situations arising and then you learn what you need to in order to deal with the situation.  Or identifying situations before they occur and again, learn what you need to in order to deal with it.  What are the best diapers?  Learn.  Where's the kid gonna sleep?  Learn.  What age will I let the kid date?  Learn.  

Don't get overwhelmed by the idea that you don't know what you're doing; whenever you try new things you don't know what you're doing.  You will learn quickly.  If you need somewhere tangible to begin read What To Expect When You're Expecting.
Best of luck. Being a parent is a wonderful thing. It is a lot of hard work, but there is nothing like the laugh anf smile of your child. You will be amazed at how fast you pick things up. 

My best advice is to sleep when you can. Also, dish soap gets out baby food stains, formula, milk, and poop. Don't worry about getting grossed out. You will be surprised how much you can handle. 

If you have any questions about anything, don't be afraid to ask. That's how you learn. Really. My daughter just turned one and we have another little girl due in July. I am still learning. 
I can say without a doubt in my mind that you are not ready for it. That's not to bash you. No matter how many "parenting" classes you take or how many books you read. You won't be ready for reality.

It's hard work, frustrating and nerve wracking. I love it. 

Raising a child is a hands on job. If you keep your head, stay focused and don't listen to EVERY bit of advice you are going to get you will be fine.


Thank you checkoutmuhhat. Reading that helped put this in perspective. I will use what you said and adapt to the situation and make the best out of it. I know everything will workout for the best. 
My sister's neighbor was a young woman who seemed like she needed help. She was a young mother, with an abusive boyfriend and a young son. My parents have huge hearts and did everything they could to help this woman. It became clear she was stealing from them and doing drugs. They didn't call the police, instead they got her into rehab. She was there for a few days and checked herself out saying she was cured. I didn't talk to my family for a while because it was clear she was an addict and they refused to report her to CPS. It took forever for them to admit she was doing drugs, although from her behavior, them her seizures, it was clear exactly what she was doing. They were in major denial until they caught her getting high.

Then she would lie about getting high. She claimed she didn't know some things would get her high (like bath salts) or that she didn't remember doing things. By this point my parents were helping with their rent (even though they really didn't have the money to be doing it), all of the child's food, clothes, diapers and toys, and a lot of stuff for this mother. It took them a while, but finally they reported her. CPS did nothing. One morning my mother begged them to check on this woman. She called, she was high, and my mother was scared she was going to hurt the child. They told my mother she had no proof and that it would have to wait. A few hours later she beat the kid badly enough that he needed to be hospitalized, but first my sister and mother had to coax her out of the street where she was pushing his stroller with him in it into traffic.

My parents were granted custody before the child left the hospital the next day. They loved him and they wanted to keep him safe. They wanted to believe the mother could get better and they continued to try to support her to get her healthy enough to be a mother again. My mother even helped her get a job and drove her to the job (she has no license because of several DUIs). She continued to get high, not do anything he judge ordered, and yet, a few months later the child was returned to her.

Six days later, he was back with my parents. She overdosed twice in one day (a new record for her) with drugs she stole from the vet she worked for. She kept threatening she would kill herself and she threatened to kill my parents and sister. They got a protective order right away. It was clear this mother was not going to get better so my parents were fighting to get this woman's right's severed. She admitted to the social worker she only wanted the kid because he allowed her to qualify for medicaid, welfare, and food stamps (she was selling the food stamps for drugs). The visits with his parents went awful, he never wanted to go, acted up when he got back (he was 18 months at the time). The mother was placed on a locked rehab ward, she was failing drug test while on the ward, and she was still given back her son two months later. He had to go from a stable home with two loving parents, a loving extended family, and friends (he would go to daycare twice a week to socialize with other children), to a locked rehab ward.

She wasn't taking care of him. His lawyer called my parents all the time to tell them. The social worker always called to get my parents to donate clothes to him (his mother, now on welfare, couldn't afford to clothe him) and they always did because they love him. They tried to get the ACLU involved, but kids have no rights. They called the governor and got him to investigate. They all agree he was thriving with my parents and miserable and in danger with his mom, but she had the right to keep him and they lost federal funding if children were not reunited with their parents.

Sunday things came to a head. We were Christening my daughter and we got a called that she had killed herself and the child. We were hysterical. We had to find a way to get through the day and celebrate my daughter while grieving this child. I lost my oldest to a genetic disorder and already knew the pain of loosing a child. The sounds my parents made in grief killed me. I had to tell my sister. We had a house full of people and we found a way to get through it, but then we were all crying, preparing to bury this child. The thing is, the news reported different names. My parents got their hopes up that there was a mistake. No one called my parents to correct this mistake. My mother called them. Come to find out, the mothers had been in rehab together. The woman we knew left her purse and some of her son's stuff in the other woman's car, which lead to them misidentifying the bodies. It was a hallow victory because a child is still dead.

Now they are even more desperate to get him back. This woman has a long history of suicide attempts and now she learned another way to kill herself and take her son with him. My parents don't want to see that happen. They are looking for any legal way they can to get this kid back. The social worker admitted to my mother that the child is doing terrible with his mother and she is not taking care of him, but that there isn't much she can do. They are looking for any advocacy groups, or anyone that knows the system and can help.

If anyone has experience with the foster care system and has any tips or ideas, please let me know. My parents will do anything they can to get him back. 
Just wanted to say I read this whole post (due to lack of comments and possibly people not wanting to read a wall of text) and although I can't help, I really feel sorry for your parents and this whole situation and really wish there was any way I can help. If you are in Florida by any chance, let me know, I'll do what I can. 

Tell your parents that if they find him, to get rid of her from his life right away. It's of utmost importance.
Thank you so much. They are in Rhode Island. If they ever get him back they are going to a lawyer right away and fighting to get her rights severed. They didn't before because they never though she would get him back until she was clean. Now that they know that is the case and that this woman really doesn't want help, their focus is getting him away from her.
I am a 17-year-old girl with a 19-year-old sister who keeps taking things from me. She's been doing this for quite some time and it's really frustrating. I'm not talking about her borrowing my clothes or using my lipgloss without asking, she actually takes things and claim it as her own, saying I either gave it to her or she bought it herself. I have been trying to cope for a few years now but today was the last drop. I came home after having been at my boyfriend's house for the summer, when I got home I wanted to wash my face in the bathroom only to find that my face wash, moisterizer and shampoo have been completely cleared out from their bottles and left there, like I wouldn't notice. Gah! I would not mind borrowing her some if she's out of products to use, but for her to squeeze the entire thing out of the bottle and politely leave it there just tips the scale from calm to absolutely pissed.

She does things like this all the time, takes my nail polishes, removes the lables and when I ask her if she's seen them, she says she hasn't. It isn't until I sneak into her room while she's gone I find the nail polish, my underwear, shirts and dresses; things I hadn't even noticed was gone!

The thing that really bothers me is that it isn't like she's so poor she can't afford her own things, she's a very rich 19-year-old all because I am currently not getting along with my father, and so he gives the money he made us share before, only to my sister now. 

I have thought of ways to make this behaviour stop, because I am absolutely losing it. Locking my bedroom door wouldn't help since every door has the same lock in my house and her key would work just as good as mine does. Talking to her wouldn't help too much either, I would assume. My sister has Aspergers and doesn't always understand why this makes me upset. She's also very self centered and so I don't think she realises that what she's doing actually makes everything harder for me, since I am the one who can't even keep my shampoo in the bathroom without it getting used up.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I am going to have a breakdown if this doesn't stop.
This is going to sound terrible, but buy a lock box. Put all the things you value the most in there. Lock up whatever you can. I would tell you to get a lock for your room if you could, but that could be hard without your parents' support. You should talk to the parent you live with. Stress that it is more than just "borrowing" and you are very sick of it. You need to have your own things and your sister cannot have them. They may keep telling you this is normal sister stuff, but it isn't. Your sister has some issues she needs to work through. I wish you the best. There may not be much you can do until you move out.
Sadly you cannot *make* her stop, or empathize. Unless she is willing to stop for herself there is nothing you can do on the *emotional* side of things.

The only things you can do are practical things. If the key to the house will work on your room then change the lock! Go out and buy your own with only one key and keep it with you. Keep everything in your room. Maybe you can buy some [fridge cages](https://edgecastcdn.net/800034/www.perpetualkid.com/productimages/lg2/LOCK-0100.jpg) and keep your makeup and other small items in them.

Tell whichever parent you are living with how you feel about this, and that you won't tolerate the stealing any more. Sadly, these years that you've been letting her get away with it has most likely given her the impression that it's okay.. so establishing boundaries now will be difficult but it needs to be done.

Also talk to your sister and tell her that you will no longer let her "borrow" or use anything of yours because she has stolen from you and taken advantage so you cannot trust her.

If your parent(s) don't support you in this you may just have to grin and bear it until you can move out on your own. Its sucks, but that's what I had to do... my brother stole from me constantly and the only thing that really stopped it was leaving.

Good luck, I hope things get better.


I have friends who also have Aspergers and it can be a challenge and a half sometimes, but your father sounds like he's an enabling parent, you need both their support and seems you're not getting it. Have your parents done anything about this before? I would think the last thing they want is a daughter with reinforced bad behaviors like that. Sit down with your sister, she needs things explained to her in a very straight forward manner, of course she's self centered, that's just one hitch that can come with her personality! Just explain that you would appreciate her asking before taking, as your things are personal property and are not for sharing. If it continues, change your lock and let her know you don't trust her since she continued to disrespect you and your belongings. Beyond that, your parents should...be parents. There's no reason for your adult sister to be acting this way when this behavior can be knocked out of even Aspergers children well before middle school! My sister was a kleptomaniac all her youth,  and she didn't stop, I still gotta sort through her things when visiting ;) just be assertive and stern, but not rude or bratty, you won't get anywhere just ranting as whining, trust! Good luck.
Set up a camera and film her stealing stuff. :P And then show it as proof. Or even better, if you know she'll take something specific, put something on it, like food dye and when she touches it, her hands turn red, she'll be pissed but you'll say, that's mine and now you're caught red-handed.

Is there anything she's scared of? If she's so scared of something that even an image will scare her, then put it on your doorway.

Steal her room key. Claim it's yours or you have no idea where hers went. Start taking her stuff then, she claims you already do it, so whatever right? (probably not the best solution, but it might put her in her place)

Label all your things in a VERY permanent way that you can't get off. So when she takes it, she constantly sees your name on it. 
Thanks for the tips! I live with my mum and she is aware of the fact that my sister is taking things, she steals from my mum as well. Weirdly enough, my mother isn't willing to do something about it. Maybe it is her motherly love for my sister, maybe she's afraid my sister will close up even more.

I will definitely investigate in locks and other things to insure I get to keep my things to myself.

As for moving out, I cannot wait until that happens. Two more years and then I get to keep my razor to myself!
Thank you for the tip! I'll definitely look into fridge cages. I really wish I could be the normal nice sister and share my things with her, but it is truly impossible. Sometimes when I try talking to her about this, she says I borrow things from her all the time or that I owe her money (which I don't) to make a point that it is ok for her to "borrow" things from me too. Sisters, eh?
Yeah, my father has never been a believer in mental illness and such, in spite the fact that he's clearly a sociopath. My sister has always ignored her condition, which truly is a shame since her life would be so much easier if she'd get some help. Thanks for sharing! It feels good knowing that this is quite common 
Good luck. Some parents don't want to be the bad guy or they don't want to admit something is an issue. It makes it hard. I have an older sister, we haven't lived together for several years now, but I know it can be really hard. My sister and I had some issues, namely her boyfriend who was living in the house and was awful to me. My parents did nothing because they figured it was better to keep them close. I moved out with my long term boyfriend and didn't look back. We have been together 11 years this September,  married for five of them (we stared dating when I was 16). Moving out did wonders for me. Hang in there. I know two years is a long time, but you'll get there. My sister did eventually break up with the jerk after he cheated on her (with a stripper. I wish I was making this up). We have a much better relationship now that we don't butt heads every day.
The best thing you can do for your sister is learn about aspergers. It honestly brings so much to light for you, you'll be less stressed just having a better understanding of her. From there you'll be more prepared to handle her, especially when it sounds like you're the only one thinking straight at the moment. 
That sounds so nice, just leaving everything behind and starting fresh without people around you to make your life a living hell! I'm happy things worked out in the end and thank you for sharing!
Everyone is gifted in someway or other. For me its that me, my dad and mom have the same birthday. It was today. It has been a year since I saw them. Feeling little sad :( 

My mom calls me everyday, she loves me a lot. Like the CEO of a company does almost everything for his firm, my mom has nothing else in her life than me. My dad also loves me a lot. I am lucky to have such nice parents. I missed them today.
Happy birthday to you all! Visit when you can. Life moves so quickly. 
y u no see them?

THE JOY, IT HURTS.
I am five years older than my brother. My brother is the one holding me. :) I love you, bro!

Everyone in my family is deaf but me. I hardly ever get embarrassed by my family. Most of the time I am pretty proud of them as a matter of fact. However some one bought my mother a flashlight that had a pull cord rape alarm. This cord was pulled out of the flashlight while it was in my mom's purse at the grocery store one day. The alarm went off and everyone in the store stopped walking and turned to stare at us as if we had stole something. I looked around listening to the sound of the alarm not knowing what it was and grabbed my mom's purse. Oblivious to the noise she yanked back her purse because she was trying to find her check book in it, and told me to stop. I could feel the stare of a million eyes down on me and they all started to turn to sweat that was pouring down me. I grabbed the purse again and mom raised her head out of her purse and gave me the stare of DEATH. So I  stood there with everyone staring, new people coming down the aisles to see what was going on, and the store manager walking over asking is there something wrong. My mom finally found her checkbook and came out of her purse to see the store manager staring at her. Then she turned to stare at me. I told her there was an alarm going off in her purse. She said "What?" I repeated my statement. Then I asked if I may go through her purse. My mom who NEVER let me go through her purse handed it over. I found the flash light but could not find the pull cord to reinsert. I pulled it out and my mom instantly knew where that was and plugged it up. Finally everyone stopped staring. My mom was just now beginning to take notice of how many people's attention we had ensnared as she looked around the store. So she thought it would be fun to pull the cord again, plug it up, pull it out, plug it up, pull it out. I had never given my mom the stare of DEATH but that was the day. My mom turned to see my face and then immediately plugged it up and put it away. She was the only one in the store laughing.
I can remember a time that would be really embarrassing to me but I think in a few years you might be able to laugh about it. 
I was just thinking about this. I'm a 15 year okd male, and mine would be my 11 year old cousin. Basically, he acts like he is 3. When I was younger, he did anything to piss me off. He hogged all my video games and stuff. He tried to play on my DS, even though he had his own. He would cry to my parents made me give it to him, and gave that "sharing is caring speech" His dad (my uncle) would tell him to man up and made him give it back. My uncle is in his 30s and has been in the army since he turned 18. When I got a Wii U for Christmas in 2012, I got to play it maybe the first day and that was it. He was at our house from the 26th to January 2nd, and he played it the entire day all of those days. I would have to wake up very early just so I could play. He was 7 at the time and I was 10. I had to force him to let me play on the last day he was home because I had to go back to school the next day. He said he was feeling "homesick" and made my uncle take him back home. He only sees his dad twice a year, so I don't get how he could get homesick. The next year I finally put my foot down and said no when he asked to use my stuff. My parents (my mom anyway, my dad had seen past his crap a long time before this) made me "share" when it was just him hogging my stuff. 2014 we actually got along. The last time I saw him was Christmas 2015, and this was the worst. He was 10, I was 13. He got mad because he couldn't watch TV in the living room while my uncle was trying to watch a movie with my dad and brother, even though I had all the same channels in my room. He would cry, and when my dog would come over to comfort him, he would yell at her and hit her. He terrorized my dog any way he could while he was there. The worst though, was one of the last couple days he was here. He asked to borrow my phone to watch "Minecraft videos" I said ok because I was going to watch a movie with my family. For some reason, he closed the door behind me. I shrugged it off. Later I went back to my room and saw something disturbing. He was watching porn, like intense porn on my phone with the volume on. He was whacking off on my bed, not even covered up, and then jizzed all over my blankets and sheets. That was probably the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. I asked him what the hell he was doing, and he said he was just watching a "Minecraft animation" I said bullshit and my whole family came in there and saw him. His dad yelled at him for a while, and I was in there with my uncle. I had no idea what masturbating even was until I was 12 or 13, and I have no idea where he learned it. I didn't see him this past Christmas, and I'm glad. Sorry this was so long, but I had to get it out. 
Hello ill try to keep this as simple as possible. I grew up an only child but have a half brother and sister i had never met. Well i met my half sister a couple weeks ago for the first time and we instantly connected and are best friends now. She is 32 i am 25 and male. Well i have never really had any relationships or dated much at all and am pretty lonely at this point in my life. Both our families are a little dysfunctional, and i always moving around growing up. 

Anyways. I absolutely adore my older sister i have never felt a love like this for anyone else. She is an attractive woman but i dont want my feelings to develop into incestuous feelings and she has a husband and 2 kids and i wouldnt want to even try anything. Its just a love that i dont know how to express i guess. I haye being away from her and i dont know. 

I dont know how to deal with these feelings of love or how to express them and i wanted to get this off my chest

Thanks for reading
It sounds like you are mistaking platonic love for romantic. You have had a tough life and now you have someone who understands and loves you. It is possible to connect with someone and not share romantic feelings. If you become overwhelmed then seeing a therapisht may help.
Youre right. It is so amazing to meet someone who understands and loves you, i dont know how to describe itm im not trying to have romantic feelings form but they do sometimes and i have to not think about them but theyre pretty rare occurence. She is blood related so i feel that primal protection/survival of genes i suppose. 

Yeah a therapist would be great but i am pretty poor right now
It can be confusing. Hang in there.
As I've grown up I've started to become less and less like my parents, and now at almost 20 years old, I'm a completely, totally different person than them. I'm the "black sheep" of the family, basically. I'm an open-minded, free-spirited kind of person, and I'm very non-judgmental and kind to basically everyone, despite my mental health problems. (I have depression & anxiety which I am taking unhelpful medication for.) My mother is the opposite. She's conservative and close-minded, and she always believes her opinion is right. She's been nagging me lately that I should buy more shorts, because I don't have many. So today I went to the mall and picked out a pair that were on sale. The shorts are mid-thigh length -- everything is covered. I came home and got lectured by my mother because she thinks I'm "not skinny enough" to wear shorts that aren't knee length. I'm at a completely average weight for someone my size, by the way - I'm absolutely considered skinny / average. She also believes they're also inappropriate, too- as I said before, everything is seriously completely covered. Another issue is my hair color. I wanted to dye my hair for years, until I finally got the courage to dye it pink when I was at college a few months ago. I thought the dye would wash out after a while, but it wasn't completely gone by the time I needed to go home for break. So I had to call my parents, sobbing on the phone, begging them to just accept it and not kick me out of the house. My father, who is nicer than she is, thankfully, convinced her to let it go, but she makes remarks sometimes about how she thinks it's "weird" and "unnattractive" and "boys won't like it". Whenever I wear black or dark clothes, she tells me I look awful because I'm too pale. I'm terrified that somehow she'll figure out that I've had sex before, and that I do go out to parties while I'm at school. I'm a good, hardworking student, but she can't tolerate anything I like / enjoy. It's hard to believe that she's the same mother who cries sometimes because she blames herself for my depression, because she thinks she didn't give me enough love as a child. She definitely did not, but I will never admit that to her because I still don't want her to blame herself. I think part of her problem is that she had low self esteem since her childhood, and I think she was mocked for being overweight when she was my age, but I just don't think that's a legitimate excuse for making me feel terrible, especially when I'm already constantly sad and crying because of my mental health problems. I don't know what to do.
Your mom sounds like a narcisist. Nothing you ever do is going to please her. Some people are what I like to call, emotional vampires. They will suck the life out of you if you let them. You are 20 and trying to figure out who you are as a person. Dye your hair. Form relationships. See what's out there. It is perfectly acceptable to have sex. Just be sure it is safe sex. I was a lot more anxious when I lived with my parents. I love my mom, but she is a drama queen. She makes everything out to be the end of the world and my dad gets angry at anything. 

It took me years to get over it. I want to say I moved out and that cured it, but that would be a lie. It was my mom taking advantage of me at my weakest point, after my oldest daughter died from trisomy at six days old. My husband and I got into therapy fast and had an amazing therapist. He helped us see we were the normal ones and our families were bat shit crazy. It helped give me the courage to have a backbone. I stand up to them now. I won't let my girls (I have two more daughters) ever see that and think it is normal. You will get there. It is hard when you rely on them. Once you are independent you can be yourself without fear of retribution. I am always around if you want to talk. Best of luck.
Thank you so much! It really is comforting to know that someone else can relate, although I'm sorry you also had to deal with harsh parents. It's funny that you said that my mom sounds like a narcissist, because I've thought for years that she seems like one, although I doubt that she actually is. Anyway, it's great to hear that you're doing better & you've gotten over your situation with your family. I hope I can do the same eventually, and for now I'm just holding on until I'm independent someday.
My mother is honestly the reason that I'm in a bad mood on a daily basis. To me, she overreacts about everything. For example, one day I didn't get up at the time I was supposed to for school (alarm didn't go off) so she poured water on me, and as a result, she said I looked at her really rudely, which I probably did. And she got upset at me. She yelled and cursed and said I was ungrateful, because if anything I should be happy she even woke me up at all. Today, she got mad and said I was talking back because when she told me to clean up something I told her it was already done (not in a rude way either). And she was like "Shut up. You're being annoying. I didn't ask you if it was done or not." Then, when I wanted to talk to her about something at school, I started talking, and she cut me off and was like, "I need you to hurry up because I'm busy. It better be important." And it wasn't what she said, but the way she said it. Anyways I told her that it wasn't important, but I wish I had more time to talk to her, and basically how everytime I try to talk to her she says she's busy. She got really mad about that too because apparently, she was filling out paperwork for me (and that's why she was busy). She said I'm so ungrateful, because I'm complaining about her being busy, and if I'm being honest I don't see the big deal. It's just, sometimes I feel ignored at home. The only time we really talk is when she's yelling at me about something. Like I"ll do something good or get an award and she'll find out and be like "When did that happen, why didn't you tell me?" And I don't tell her because she doesn't ask and when I do try to say something she's busy. And it's not like I don't appreciate what she does, but I'm human too. I get upset and I complain sometimes: Don't we all?
Sorry OP. Your mother's behavior is not normal. She is abusing you by constantly screaming and yelling, never showing you any kindness or even human decency. I am so sorry your mom doesn't treat you better. I am sure you are a wonderful person.

How long til you can go off to college and never look back?

Are there any relatives you can confide in, maybe even go to live with?
Sorry to hear that OP. Wait till you get to college... Then you'll have some peace of mind. Until then... Just try and tolerate it. When my mom says hurtful things to me, I repeat them to her in the same tone, and demeanor and 9 times out of 10 she will shut the fuck up.
Hi there!
So a couple days ago my older brother (which is the middle brother, I am the youngest) messaged me and told me that "he knows he never tells me it but he loves me and that I can open up to him and tell him things, he was also a teenager at one point". I find it weird cause my brother and I never really talk. When we see each other its a "hi, how are you? hows school?" Type of convo and thats it. Silence occurs and then I usually awkwardly walk out. I told my mom how I really dont feel like we have any type of connection, anything in common, and I just feel plain uncomfortable around him. He's cool and everything but I'm just weird lol. He can have a long conversation with my cousins (which around my age) with no problem, but him and I try not to talk to each other. Im just confused because my oldest brother and I met a couple years ago and when I visit him we can have regular crazy convo's... but with the middle brother, who I see more regularly and actually grew up with I cant find myself to talk to him. I dont know why and just wanted someone to talk to and see if they ever felt this sort of way towards one of their siblings. I acknowledge that he's my family and I love him but I just dont feel a connection. Any thoughts? They would be highly appreciated!
Try and talk to him more? I know it can be hard but my sister is way older than me. We never talked due to my mother (long story) but now we are talking. Sure, it was a little awkward at first but I find that I can talk to her about ANYTHING now, and I mean ANYTHING. Which is good for any young adult/ teen. Try and talk to him. What's the worst that can happen? Right? :)
I guess the question is what kind of a relationship do you WANT with him? People grow and change, get closer or drift apart, and you can always work to bridge a gap if it's bothering you.

It's not right or wrong either way, just depends on how you want your life to go and who you want in it.
Quick background... I work abroad and my family is back in the states.  I really don't speak to my extended family anymore so when I visit home, its mostly to see my immediate family and my bro and sis' kids.  Now that my mom is in a nursing home, I have no place to stay when I come home to visit so I have to spend a ton of money on hotels.  My fam and friends claim to be happy to see me but they never offer to put me up.  My dad has an extra bedroom but its occupied by his soon to be divorced girlfriend's daughter.  My sis doesn't have a spare bedroom but that doesn't mean I couldn't crash on the couch.  This year, staying at my brother's house would be an ideal option.  He, the wife and kids are going away for 2 days and there's no reason I couldn't crash there and essentially house sit for 2 days.  My request was met with, "Ooooh let me ask the wife and get back to you."  Really?  I wont even be in their hair.  Now, my brother's wife has severe OCD and is funny when it comes to this stuff but I am her husbands brother, the best man at his wedding.  Couldn't he or someone else back home just make room?  I am only visiting for a few days before heading off to a wedding upstate.  Am I wrong for feeling let down?  I almost don't even want to visit anymore.
You're not wrong but they're also under no obligation.  If it's become too much of a hassle to visit, maybe spend your free time & money somewhere that you'd enjoy more.  Also, if they do let you crash you are under an obligation to do something nice for them like bring a nice bottle or "thank you" gift for letting you crash. 
They're under 0 obligation to house you while you visit. 


Sure, it would be nice, but they don't owe you that. 
my mom is bipolar, angry all the time, and she doesn't listen to anyone. that is just her personality and no one in her family likes her. I have to deal with all the adult responsibilities even though I just turned 14 three months ago. I understand that she does not speak English so I help her out to the extent. but it gets really hard because I have to do the taxes, pay the bills, re-fuel the car because she does not know how to, and many more things that I can't even count them. she is very aggressive, so whenever I do something wrong or I don't know how to do it she would yell at me. HARD. it is so emotionally damaging to the point where sometimes I want to end my life. (i know it seems like a very "teen" thing to do but i do feel that way). on top of everything, I still have a school life and social life. at school my grades  drop, and most of the time I won't even go to school because i am under so much stress. all of these things leave me with little to no time to hang out with my friends where i have a good time and escape my reality. but even when I hang out with them I have to hide what i am going through because i am a funny person and the "strongest" one in my group and it would be weird to open up like that. I normally stay up till 3 AM every school night watching videos and tv shows as another way to escape. and that leads to not getting enough sleep that I cant function in school and sometimes don't even wake up. my counsellor saw that I was slacking in my attendance, so she talked to me a few times and i open up to her.  she said our conversations were confidential and she would not tell anyone. but she did. The only person I trusted called my mom and told her everything about my attendance and grades (my mom is very traditional chinese so this really mattered to her). those few days where she had meetings with my counsellor and the translator were the hardest days of my life. before school I would have anxiety attacks and cry outside hoping no one would see me. during school I have to put on a fake mask to all my friends. after school when I go home I would just cry for hours until my pillow soaked. after the few days were over, we all had a meeting. The counsellor, the translator, my mom, and i. I was bawling my eyes out the entire time, and my counsellor was just explaining to my mom how she shouldn't depend on me so much. but my mom took none of that in and instead she was all focussed on my attendance and my grades, it's like she doesn't even care. on the drive home, she was just yelling at me saying how she well kill herself and me too and many other vulgar things. 





my family life is so messed up including the part where my parents are divorced. and i've seen my parents physically and verbally assault each other. my older brother has anger issues and autism that growing up all the attention was on him. everything together just pushed me to the very last straw which is ending my own life. i really don't want to because i think there's so many opportunities beyond this. please help me i don't know what to do. 



p.s sorry if some of this doesn't make sense i tried to write as much as i can without breaking down. i hope you understand what i'm getting at❤️

I am sorry for hearing that. I have no idea how your family life should be in your culture, but what you discribe sounds like you are caring for an adult baby. I have two children and of course I have to care for every thing, cause they are not able to care for themselves. But your mother is old enough to do these things alone. To learn the language, to pay the bills and over all to care for you. You are not in the world to serve her. 
If your mother is bipolar, she should make a therapy. Do you have grandparents or can you live at your father's house? Or some family friends? 
Perhaps there is an institution like Caritas, Red Cross or another social caring institution in your town, where you get help. They often offer psychological help for you and your mother, cause this situation is also psychological hard for you. 
Try to tell your problems to your friends. If they are real friends and not just for fun, they will help you, and if it's only, that they listen to your problems. Often they see a way out, because they are not as much emotional involved as you are. 

If your mother wants you to do all of here tasks, refuse doing it. It is not unthankful. It is just not your job to do ALL. 

I hope you find a way out without killing yourself. Life is beautiful. 
It is time to find a trusted adult and tell them you need help. Tell teachers or anyone who will listen that you need help. You are just a kid. You can't do it all.
Hang in there. Teachers or your friends' parents might be good people to turn to. Try to stay strong, it is not fair for you to have so much responsibility at your age, but good for you for doing so much. Find a health clinic, they can help you find resources to improve your situation. I hope you can find a different living situation soon. Stay strong, life can get so much better. 
I know I’m late I really hope youre still with us!! I'm very sorry to hear of what you're going through especially that I have firsthand experience with this. I'm 17 years old, and this still happens since I was younger but it has gotten less severe. I know you might not be so interested in hearing about my experience, but I just wanted to show you there is a way out. Suicide is not the answer, believe me. Talk to someone about this. Years later, when youll get to look back with a clearer view, you might realise that the counsellor is either a. stupid b. thought they were helping! Seriously some people think the parents would help because some students tend to overdescribe. You will also realise there were many many people you could have talked to.
(This will be an example. Skip to next para if you want to) For instance, in 8th grade I went through some serious bullying. Now i realise those were fed. crimes i couldve reported and there were many ppl who could have helped (teachers, principal, gov officials etc.) Now that I'm older I have to let it go.
If it's extremely serious, and you can provide PROOF (even if weak proof) try to contact embassies (usually European so UK, Swedish, yeah... Australia too.) with your bro and this can be your new chance. Sorry, this decision is intensely fatal and is meant for people going through abusive households. If you think you are endangered and deserve a new life, please do this. (For example, if there are details you left out of this post) Anything but killing yourself. These embassies can help you move into their country. But your problem can have less severe solutions! Please stay strong.
I have absolute zero emotional connection with not only my family, but also to people around me. I'm very easy to blend in to a social circle. I have joined multiple clubs and frankly, may I say, that most people adore my presence. However, when it comes to maintain this "connection" on a daily basis. I'm not able to do so, actually I'm quite repulsed by this very idea. I have this same feeling toward my family, too. I don't hate them, I don't want to kill them. But, from time to time, I do wish they'd just disappear. People say things will change once they died. I don't agree with it, because I know for a fact I won't shed a tear if my "mother" pass away at this second. I've looked up some peer reviewed documents as well as psychology books that these are traits of a psychopath. However, I don't believe I'm one because I don't carry any of the dangerous signs.
I'm not a doctor but no offense, why bother wondering , yes it's a little odd, the way u feel about ur mother is how I feel about my father but for different reasons, my father was a monster idk about ur mother, but don't worry about being psychotic, don't label yourself but if it really is bothering u I suggest you see a psychiatrist, don't label yourself 
My in laws are ruining my holidays.

My fiancé and I have a little baby girl (5 months old). Before she was born we started planning this holiday. Originally it was going to be us three going to the south of France with my parents (We're French, fiancé and his parents are British).

SO (significant other) thought it would be nice his parents came. I wasn't overjoyed but said yes, thinking they'd join us only for a few days but nope, they came for the whole two weeks. Now: They don't like the heat His mum doesn't like the sun and doesn't swim (we rented a pool) They have no interest in food (come on guys, this is France), as in they happily have a cereal bar and an apple for lunch. His dad is doing a stupid "pre-diabetic" diet that he doesn't need to do anymore and he pisses everyone off about it. They are incredibly predictable: tea, dad shaves at 6pm, etc etc. They only like visiting museums/churches/historical stuff with zero interest in walking about nice villages, etc.

We like doing a mix, we like good food, etc. So it's clashing completely. On top of that they are very selfish and they didn't rent a car so expect SO to drive them to some new place everyday.

A few examples of what has happened already:

We went to the restaurant for the first time on Sunday, in a lovely village, and picked a nice restaurant because we (my parents and I) thought it'd be nice to get his parents to try Nice food. We all had the same priced starter plus main formula apart from the mum who had an omelette, but when came the check we just split it in three and didn't think twice about it Apparently SO's dad went and told him later on "I think from now on when you all go to the restaurant we'll just go do our own thing". When SO said "well you seem to have enjoyed your food though" he said "well I better do if we're going to split the check" But it doesn't bother him to spend the kitty's money on cheese and fruit on the market... 20 euros of cheese and same of fruits because of his stupid diet.

Yesterday we all went to the same town and were supposed to visit together but they decided at lunch time to just have a tea and pain au chocolat so SO went with us to eat We texted them saying we'll meet at 2.30 for the visit of a château They didn't wait Then inside at some point we saw them so went to meet them , baby got pissed off so I said I'd leave and wait outside as I had seen that place before I left, and my mum and Dad got themselves ready to finish the visit with So and his parents But they had sodded off My parents felt bad for me so rushed out to meet me, whereas the other three were still inside two hours later Had the cheek to ask if we enjoyed the visit And when we got back SO's dad asked his mum to prepare him an omelette before dinner because "well lilybleue you see I didn't eat because I was too busy learning about the sites" Meaning "you lot are just greedy ignorants"

This is just the start but it is ruining my holidays, my parents' and SO's. He likes doing a mix of things and so so I. But above all he loves French food and restaurants. He would like to do more stuff with us and definitely not eat a cereal bar for lunch but doesn't dare say much. We're just arguing and on edge because of how different everyone's expectations are.

There's also obviously the language barrier to add to that and the usual grandparents "fighting" to spend time with baby. But where my parents sacrifice their visits or relaxation time to be with our little one, his parents just have her when convenient for them.

They are driving me nuts.
Ah crap! I'm sorry you're having such an awful vacation. That truly sucks! Maybe they'd be better off spending most of the time on their own if they are that unflexible. 
Yeah just tell them that you're looking to continue your holiday with plenty of what they don't seem to be enjoying. Just make an offer that if they would rather not come, they don't have to. 

I don't just do this on holidays with in-laws, I do it with anyone. Just because you're in a trip, you don't have to be joined at the hip. 

Tell you SO to speak up too.
Next time be clear with expectations. Invite them only fir however long you wish them to stay. Let them do their own thing. They are adults, you don't need to babysit them and see their every whim. Make your own plans. Next time, don't invite them.
>"I think from now on when you all go to the restaurant we'll just go do our own thing".

Your answer here should be "OK."

And I'm not sure if it's healthy for a diabetic or pre-diabetic to eat cheese and fruit.  
The main issue is that we do have to babysit them. My parents have their own car so they really do what they want, but so's parents didn't want to rent a car for themselves or even put so's dad down as a driver on out rental car... So they need to be taxied around. 

It's just that what they call "liking to do their own thing", we call rude, but SO doesn't seem to understand that. Like how his mum sat down with her back to my mum at breakfast and didn't look nor spoke to her (only them too where at the table at that time) 

They can arrange their own transportation then. It was their choice.
So short story , 
My father died few months ago and my brother is in that age of I don't know teenager phase or something. He is out of control and we don't know how to handle it our family is us me mum and my little sister. He got involved with bad friends mom literally had to keep him home one way and another the thing is it's affecting the rest of us badly
We can't handle his behavior anymore. 
Honestly after my father passed I had to go through the university and everything else and kept my emotions shut so now I'm on the edge and can't handle his tantrum and bad attitude just because I was away everyone except me I would just take what ever they throw my way 
I'm not sure what to do 

So to summarize it all 
One my brother actions are tiring us all 
Two I'm not sure out to do about my short fuse too 

He needs go get into therapy and fast. He needs help navigating what he us feeling.
That's the thing my mother don't want to 
Since he is her only son she keeps going my boy is fine he will grow and will get out of this childish behavior

The boy is generally fine but since he is the only boy he somehow thinks he is the man of the house and could do whatever the hell he want which included making me and my sister get pissed off knowing our mother all will do is just say "hey stop it you are siblings be nice to each other" that's it 
If I tell her that can't be all she goes on and on I'm tired I'm whatever and somehow want us to magically be a happy family 
I think all of us should go thorough counseling I started without anyone knowing but still it's hard on me I don't know what to do 
Is there a particular way I should open up about the topic with my mother 
I'm afraid she will flat out reject 
Yes, you should go through counseling.  Losing a father/husband is incredibly hard for anyone to deal with.  Especially younger people and teens who already have a lot of issues to deal with just trying to grow up.
I'm 22, and I have never, ever, ever been in a real relationship. I've never been kissed and I am a virgin. It honestly breaks my heart because I feel like a giant baby and it will never happen for me.

If it helps I was diagnosed with Aspergers at age 5 but I believe I was misdiagnosed because I exhibit more ADHD like behaviors and always felt a little out of place around other Aspies.

I have voiced my concerns to my mother and she told me:

"You should marry someone who makes you happy. You should find men on the spectrum. Normal men won't understand you or think your beautiful."

She honestly could have stopped at the first sentence, because the "you should date someone on the spectrum" sort of indicates her happiness is more important than mine.

Right now, I have a severely autistic young man pining after me. He throws public meltdowns and is **OBSESSED** with Spongebob. To say that's not exactly what I'm looking for in a partner would be a gross understatement.

I like to think he is attracted to me because he thinks I have my stuff together and could take care of him. That's the vibe I am getting from him. I'm sorry, but I want to be someone's partner, not their babysitter or mom.

I told her about this young man and she is like "It doesn't have to be that guy. Just look for someone with autism because they'll get you."

She also said "find someone who hates sex and hates being touched." I am a pretty slow-paced lover and really want to know someone before I even entertain the thought of fucking them. She interprets this as "I hate sex." Far from it, I want to have it someday.

So basically, she wants me to find a Sheldon Cooper. If a potential partner or spouse was anything like Sheldon Cooper I would run the hell away.

I want my mom to realize she is being incredibly insulting and patronizing. I feel like she doesn't respect me and my wishes to be loved.

How do I get through to her?
How about printing and showing her this post?  You've stated your case very clearly as well as made your feelings clear.  If she read it I think she'd have to be incredibly dense NOT to understand what you're saying!

DO NOT marry or have a baby with a man on the spectrum!!!  I did, and our son is SEVERELY AUTISTIC.  He requires around-the-clock care, even needs a coach to go to work with him and keep him on task.  He is non-verbal and echolalic -- I have NEVER had a conversation with my son in his 32 yrs, and have accepted that it probably won't happen.  So this is what you'll have to look forward to if you cave in to your Mom!  8)
Your mom is wrong. Find someone who makes you happy. It doesn't take someone on the spectrum to understand you. You shouldn't have to find someone whose sole purpose is for you to takw after him. Be patient. Keep trying. You will find someone for you.

I'd straight up tell her she is being insulting and patronizing!  Just because you've received a diagnosis of ASD doesn't mean you must fit in this exact mold she pictures.  It's called a spectrum for a reason.  Plus there are plenty of adults out there who are likely on the spectrum without a diagnosis.  Your mom sounds manipulative.  Date whoever makes you happy.  This is your life not hers.
Is she really serious? I mean that in a matter of fact way and not a SERIOUSLY?! sort of way. I assume you're an adult. Remember that you can make your own decision here if you don't think this is good advice. I don't think it is honestly. My wife is on the spectrum is well but I am mostly normal (I have some mild OCD that I got from being in the Marine Corps but otherwise, very much normal mentally). She and I get along very well. I wouldn't trade our relationship for anything. 
Wow. I am so sorry to hear about your situation.

My aunt is married to a man who, he's not autistic, but has severe brain damage from an automobile accident. He is all but mentally defective, can hardly speak, he has terrible health problems (thanks in no small part to eating Hardee's at every meal), falls down the stairs all the time, and has even physically/verbally abused my aunt. I am an atheist but I find myself praying to God that she divorces him. Alas she is Catholic so divorce is not an option.

I think that's what my mom basically wants, she wants me to marry someone who can't take care of themselves. It is FUCKING offensive!!!
She's dead serious. Every time, it's always "Look for men who have an Aspergers/autism diagnosis! They are the only ones who will get you! Don't bother with those 'beautiful people.'"

Yes, she actually said "beautiful people." So basically, "Date a fugmo!"

Indeed, I am an adult, and I think her advice is awful. Hell, I've talked to my dad (who is easily the more reasonable one of my two parents) and he's like "date whoever makes you happy. Just no goths." (Those still exist? lol) He still doesn't know what my mother told me. I'm going to tell him and see if he thinks mom's advice sucks, which I bet he will.

That's great about you and your wife, though.


There is something you need to know about Catholics, dear.  Some of them - not all! - feel the route to redemption and on to Heaven is paved by the amount of suffering they do for others, here on earth.

If your Mom is also Catholic she and her sister may be in competition ergo you are to be a substitute for your mother in the Race to Redemption.  If your Mom is not Catholic she needs to either get thee to a nunnery and become one, or see a shrink; because *wanting* you to take on the responsibility she does is BONKERS.  Any parent who loves their child strives to make the child's live *better* and *easier* than the one the parent had, not *harder!*

Both my parents and their siblings were raised Catholic, but my parents eventually switched to Presbyterianism when they got married because they were like "lol Catholics are stupid." Otherwise, the rest of my extended family (at least on mom's side) is Catholic.

I'm an atheist, so I'm not worried about redemption or Heaven or Hell. This is the only life I have so I'm going to make it count!

You know what they say about Catholic guilt though. I don't think it ever left my parents. Likewise, if there is such a thing as Protestant guilt, I am crawling with it. I feel horrible every time I wear a top that shows even a tiny amount of cleavage because I am "tempting" boys.

I don't know, my parents say they love me, but I've never heard them say they want me to have it easier than they did. They are the "be happy because other people have it worse than you" kind of parents that invalidate my feelings. But don't worry, they LOVE me and would take a bullet for me.
LOL  My mother always said, "It's as easy to fall in love with a rich man as it is a poor man."
So before i start , again this isnt a motivational story. you can say its a rant. But what i want is some advice. somebody to tell me what is wrong here, and what is not right.

Its going to be long, i can see it. But i will keep it as short as i can.

i will do the Tl;dr right now : 

Tl;dr - issues with my dad, prompted to the rash decision of leaving home

So, 3 months back when i came home from college after completing my graduation, i didnt expect things to be very nice, ( because we already knew that my mother has severe OCD and my dad has aggressive personality. and they have a history of always fighting with each other), but i didnt know things had become this bad ( i had stayed away from home 8 yrs. and have visited say 5 times in this timeline for short durations.) But my mother would call me and tell me that yeah, they fought. and i would be very sad, and disappointed at my dad. But i had thought that it ( the fights) happened at the same frequency and duration as it used when i used to stay at home. Nvm, so back to now. 

Now when i came back, it was totally unbearable for me. I couldnt stand it. And also my dad was angry at me for coming back because he wanted me stay there and do some job ( i think its because he didnt want me to see how bad tthey fought or something and well, i too wanted to stay there, but i had been convinced by my elder brother that coming home would be a better step). He was also angry that i hadnt qualified for residency exams. Then here, me and dad started having differences in opinions , thoughts, and decisions for myself. we had few arguements, then i stopped interacting with him. I myself did feel that i was in the 'teenage phase where you start having problems with your dad. I, according to him, was being irrational, rash, non-docile, difficult, nothing like he had seen before, haughty etc. He even slapped me ( his 23 , well i turned 24 this week, year old daughter), and then during the heat of moments he has , not just once said, that he wants me to go away, that he doesnt want to have to do anything with me, and he doesnt care where i go , what i do. 

So right now, yes i have decided to go somewhere, somewhere far, somewhere obscure , as somebody or rather nobody, start a  new life, start with nothing. I really dont know whats going to happen in that nowheres-land. i am very scared. I do consider this decision rash. like nobody in their straight mind would leave everything, their dreams and career, to a path that leads to nowhere. i will have to leave my studies. Its so bad i feel sorry for myself. I am leaving on monday, that is all i know, rest i will find out on the way
First and foremost you shouldn't spend another minute with your dad until you get a truly heartfelt apology. The fact that he slapped you just proves that he isn't a gentleman and doesn't deserve your respect, or anybody's for that matter. Men hitting women is not ok anywhere, for any reason other than self defense.

I won't say I'm against slapping/swatting children, I for one will not do it. But you aren't a child and this isn't discipline, this is a man hitting a women. He didn't smack you because you stole something, there was a disagreement and he hit you. 

Should you leave? Probably leave home but not town, why are you letting him dictate how you live your life? Leave a place where you have friends and family and start new because your dad doesn't want you around? Stand up for yourself you are a young, intelligent and accomplished woman who doesn't need to take Shit from anybody especially your father. He should be the one telling you to go out and follow your dreams, support you, push you to be great and never, and I mean never lay a hand on you.

You have an education, there are plenty of decent jobs that pay ok and have benefits. Get a job, maybe ask your brother if you can stay with him until you can save enough for your own place. I won't tell you what to do or where to go, but girl you need to do what you want to do, go where you want to go and make sure as hell you are happy. 

But... I would like to bring up a few things. 

What about your mother? Is it safe for her to live with him. If he hit you, he probably hits her and besides the physical affects, hitting somebody has a serious affects on the mind which can lead to your mothers OCD getting worse. You say they fight a lot, maybe he is also verbally abusive. Maybe his abuse is what caused her OCD first place. So before you go maybe think about her too?

Have you spoken to your brother? Does he know he hit you? Again if he hit you I promise you he's hit your mother. If my dad hit my mother there isn't a person in the world that could protect my father from me. And I love my father to death, it's just not acceptable to me one bit. 


Sorry I know I went on for a while, just make sure you do what makes you happy, you are young and have plenty of time for a career. Enjoy your life and have lots of fun, but also work hard!!!
Leaving is wise. Go somewhere safe. Your mom has to make her own decisions. He may he abusive to her as well. I wouldn't communucate with him. 
I'm from India where it's not uncommon for your parents to pick out a partner for you to get married. I'm 23 and there's this family friend's son that my mom wants me to marry.

I can look past his unappealing physical appearance, but I absolutely cannot look past the fact that he is a misogynist pig. He called my 30 year old unmarried sister "expired goods" and things like that make me really mad. He's so sexist and my mom can't see it. She thinks he's a "good boy" because he doesn't drink or smoke. I mean, for pete's sake, he's never even had a girlfriend before and he doesn't know how to talk to women. He's got my mom into this weird relationship with him where she's totally dependent on him and my mom is panicking at the fact that I'm refusing to marry him because she thinks I'm being unreasonable and that my sister is "poisoning my mind" to say no to him because she's jealous.

I realise this all sounds ridiculous, but my family as a whole is EXTREMELY toxic and I don't want to get married. I'm not ready for it. I'm in an open relationship with a guy who actually understands consent, who is very sweet and caring and loves me dearly. And my mom gets mad at me for speaking to him or going out with him.

She thinks I'm making the worst mistake of my life by saying no to marrying a misogynist sexist pig, who btw has given my mom a one week deadline to give my answer. 

Now my mom is calling me every single day and trying to get me to talk to him and "get to know him better"

I need to push back. I need to fight back. I don't know what to do. I don't want to get trapped in this fucking mess.
Don't do it, it's your life.  I realize your culture is different but if you have a choice then make it.   My mother was so mad at me for marrying, she refused to use my married last name for like 5 years after I changed it to my husband's.  Now, she loves him very much.  Good luck!
Never marry someone because your family wants it.  It will be a miserable life. I recommend getting far away from them and not speaking to them until this marriage thing is dropped.
My father(He raised me most of my life) made me swear to take care of her after he died(1950-2015). This was 3 months before I graduated from high school. He died two weeks before I graduated as a senior in high school(Died from lung failure). I have tried to keep the house clean, and she just leaves it in a state of chaos. Every time I organize the kitchen; she trashes it saying it is not good after a couple weeks of saying it is good. Every time I talk about something related to science she rolls her eyes. She has tried to get rid of my fathers books, his guns, and is even trying to get rid of the dogs(2 pugs, 1 chihuahua). We live in a desert, and she wants them in a dog house in the backyard. She has low key insulted my intelligence knowing that after not only one year after my fathers death; she started dating a man who had(emphasis that he broke up with her after...) a girlfriend. I just outright stopped. I am pissed, and I am at my limits with her. She listens to no one, not even family.       
You said it, dear: She listens to no one.  There is no benefit to anyone when you continue beating your own head against a brick wall.  Graduate, get a job, and move out on your own but do stay in touch with Mom, and check on her at least twice a week so you know she has food, is eating, and so on.  It's the best you can do until such time as Mom stops being such a blockhead.
She is an adult. She needs to take care of herself. She should have been there for you. I would find a way to move out. It is time for her to grow up and time for you to have a chance to be happy.
So right now, I'm sitting at some pub absolutely depressed and on the verge of tears because of the excessive bullying I'm receiving right now from my Dad. He sits here complaining about me - I'm right fucking next to him - about EVERYTHING. The fact I went a bit over my data contract, how I don't go out (yet I've been out loads apart from yesterday?), how I apparently didn't care about getting an outfit for upcoming prom (even though I was the one to scroll through several websites and visit several shops). Then he asks me why I've got an attitude. Hell, I dunno, cause you're complaining about me RIGHT NEXT TO ME? In front of FRIENDS?
Not to even start on my brother, 14, who tells me day by day that I'm fat, I'm ugly, a whore, to hang myself. It sounds pathetic but after years it gets to you.

Yet, some time ago I was with my friends family and I actually felt included and happy as if I was a part of them. 

It pisses me off. I hate them. I'm so mad and upset. I want to kick this damn table over and tell them to quit their bullshit.
I'm sorry. All you can do is ignore them and make a plan on how you can be secure enough to leave.
Look on the bright side: you aren't a parent who talks shit on his own kids, nor are you a brother who talks shit on and tears down his sister instead of building her up and sticking with her, knowing that one day your parents will pass away and you will only have your siblings.

But let this be a life lesson: you are going to see people in your life who are, more or less, going through what you are going through. Reach out to those marginalized and less fortunate than you, letting the pain of what you go through now motivate you to remind you of what kind of person you don't want to become. 

The family that you feel loved by? Learn from them and be like them to others, especially to those who seem to be in your current situation.
I posted about how my life got changed (for the better) last month and I just wanted to update.

My sister has settled in with me and my boyfriend and we have been getting along wonderful. There has been a few awkward moment when she has walked in on us, or the time my boyfriend forgot she had moved in and walked in on her having a shower thinking it was me. But its all perfect and we all get along.

My mum kept trying to get my sister to move back in, but sis isnt having any of it. 

My dad has got his money together and has moved house to 4 hours away from us. But he still phones my sister every day to make sure shes ok (thats mre than mum ever did)

Thank you everyone for helping me through it. It helped alot to vent on here and having people to support me through it helped so much. Thank you again.
I am so glad to hear it! Thank you for the update :)
Thank you for helping me through that tough time! :)
My brother always wants me to help him with things, with his business, with his personal projects, it's always something with him. Today, for the FIFTH day in a row, he's asked me for help with something. Let me just say, I don't mind helping him a day or two, but this is a daily thing at this point and every time I do help him, he has the nerve to disrespect me saying that I'm lazy and never do anything. I've said no over the phone to him the past couple of days, and every time I do he gets angry and just says "bye" and hangs up. The only time he ever talks to me is when he needs something and I'm tired of it. I've been trying to tell him no, I'm done helping him with this stuff, but he can't take a hint that I'm done. How do I sternly tell him that I'm done, without causing some big feud within my family? 
My wife's sister is the same. She's the older one and has always been bullying my wife when they were younger and lived together.
When we moved from Italy to the UK that stopped cause obviously she wasn't around anymore, but time to time she would still get into projects, say she wants to learn english and so she'd be pestering my wife all the time to help her out with some skype call lesson. She'd want and expect her help no matter what, no matter if she's got her own life to live, stuff to do, or she'd just want to rest after 10 hours of work, she doesn't care, and if you say "maybe another day, sorry I'm tired" she'd go mad like if you'd had just stabbed her cat or something.

My wife's sister is 31 and very immature, disrespect her parents but nonetheless does she still live in their house at zero expenses (even though she's got a full time well paid job).

She just do what she wants to do and if she decides that you're gonna be part of her plans then you either are with her 100% or you're a untrustworthy piece of crap scum of the earth.

My wife just learned how to ignore her and help if she can, because anyway the only see each other 1 month a year in total and when they're together obviously they wouldn't want to be fighting over bullshit.

If you're in the same position and he's kinda bullying you and you have to see him everyday, just tell him that you haven't got time. Maybe find a hobby for yourself or a fake one and pretend to be very busy. After all it's a favour that you're doing to him, it shouldn't be neither an obligation nor should you let him treat you like crap while you're trying to help him out.

Remember that people is a random mess and you either like to deal with their soup of bullshit because you find it somehow tolerable or you just don't. You don't have to "drink that bitter soup" throw it down the toilet and flush it away.
As of now I live in Japan, with about a year left, and we don't know where we'll be next. (Military)
My wife really wants kids, and I do too, however, I'm unsure if I want them now. My reason is that I feel like all traveling and having time to go out and enjoy life will come to an end. I am 27 and my wife is 26, so now would be an ideal age to ensure we're in shape and good health by the time our last kid is in their early 20s. I don't know if I'm here looking for advice, or to help decide, but wanted to get this out.
There is never an ideal times to have kids. There will always be something you want to do and something you could have done. In the end you need to decide what the trade off is if you want them. What will you regret more, waiting to travel or waiting to have kids. There is no right answer.
With the human race living longer, I think it's ok to wait until your 30s to have kids. Majority of my female friends gave birth to their first around 31. I would say live life to the fullest until you're 30 and then pop out the babies to enjoy the second better half of life! 
So here's the thing.  The way I've grown up and adapted to my environment of frankly, crazy adults is by learning to be a people pleaser, and I'm getting pretty sick of it.  I'm currently 27, and I just made the mistake of agreeing to call my stepdad "dad" again.  I essentially felt sorry for him because he's a hopeless needy couch potato who will probably never learn to improve before he dies seeing that's he is over 60 and quite obese with a borderline drinking problem.  

My actual dad got divorced when I was 5 and my stepdad -- I'll just call him M -- came into my life and married my mother when I was 11.  He did the best he could to "raise" me which was pretty shitty in terms of life guidance but he can't really help it, and he also has done A LOT for me in terms of financially helping me.  

I originally called him "dad" when he first married my mother because I didn't want to be in trouble with him.  That was my mentality.  It's literally as simple as that; do what your elders tell you to or you will be in trouble and they will guilt you and you won't get stuff from them which costs a good bit of money.  I remember my mom used to say about santa clause and the tooth fairy, "You must believe to receive."  It's absolutely pathetic.  I have to perpetuate this pretense of fake kindness so I can aquire material possessions and not be guilted.  I do love my family but just typing this out make me realize how I hate them in ways.  It's that control freak nature of even what I'm allowed to think about and what philosophies I want to choose and what I personally choose to believe religiously that I absolutely hate about them. 

Anyway, back on subject;  I initially called my stepdad "dad" because I was too weak to stand up to him at the age of 11 and around 18 I started calling him by his first name which I'll just call M for this discussion.  Just recently I decided to start calling him dad but I can't stand calling him that and it makes me cringe like hell every time I do it.  I'm only doing it because he's needy and because I selflishly know that he will help me out more financially if I do so.  But I also do it because that man is very lonely and it makes him feel better; you could compare it to sympathy sex, which is cringe-fully pathetic in my opinion.  The man has gone through four or five other marriages and none of is stepchildren or children call him up other than maybe his birthday.   

So just give me your input please.
If it makes you cringe to call him 'dad', then don't.

His feelings are not more important than yours.


Is there another nickname you could call him? Sounds like a guy who's trying to salvage what ever sort of life regrets he may be having in a midlife (endlife?) Crisis. Either way, you mentioned you grew more confident at 18 to stop. Summon that courage again and tell him straight out, you don't want to call him Dad, ask him if maybe you could call him "Uncle M" or I don't know something in the middle to make him a little satisfied
You don't have to call him dad if it makes you uncomfortable.
I only started calling my stepdad (who's been in my life since I was 6) "dad" in adulthood because he finally had his own child with my mom. When my half sibling started to talk I didn't want to this wedge between us so I just started using dad. Many years later I still do, and it's still awkward for me, but it may be even more awkward now to go back to his first name. Blended families are never going to be easy. Do what you feel is right for you, at the end of the day it's not a big deal. 
Please tell the people close to you how much they mean to you. Never take them for granted because you never know when it could all end.

15 years ago today my darling wife passed away from a heart attack. One moment she was fine and the next she was on the floor siezing. We were best friends and couldn't be seperated, I loved her and she loved me. She always wanted children and when we were married we had our sweet little girl. Seeing my wife and daughter together warmed my heart, her dreams had come true and she couldn't have been happier.

Then when our daughter was 9 months old, I was playing with our daughter and she was cooking dinner. She collapsed and started siezing, I phoned paramedics and stayed by her side. She passed out before the paramedics got there and she never woke up. I never got to say goodbye. She never got to see our baby girl grow up, and our daughter has no memories of her Mum. I keep a picture of her holding our daughter on my bedside table, it helps to keep her close.

She was 26 years old, beautiful, my best friend, mother of my daughter and my one true love. I miss you sweetheart.
I am so sorry for your loss. There no tellinf how long we have. I had a major health scare a week ago and the idea of leavong my husband and our kids terrifies me ans has caused me to take my health seriously. I truly hope you are doing okay.
Congratulations, you made me cry at work. I'm sorry for your loss, hope your good now.
I am doing well, I remember it like it was yesterday. I hope you are doing ok after the health scare.
Thanks. I have had to eat a lot healthier, but so far I am making good progress :)
Good I hope it all works out for you.
I recently found out that my son has fathered three children via sperm donations. Two of children were born to a lesbian friend of his and the third child was born to a heterosexual couple who are college classmates of his. He recently told me about this because he was had will done and if he was to die unexpected he wants his assests and money to be divided between the three kids. The lesbian's children are two girls that 4 and 5 and the couple's child is a boy that is a year old. The couple with the boy moved away to another state and my son will probably have visits with that child every few years. He said he sees the lesbian friend and her daughters every few months, but he doesn't play a father role in their lives. He showed me pictures of all three kids and I was heartbroken and asked if I could ever meet them and he said no and that he has promised his friends that no one from his family will ever have contact with the kids. 

I don't have any other kids and my son has said that he might donate sperm to another lesbian couple that he is friends with. They recently married and are planning on starting a family in a couple of years. I just don't know how to deal with these revelations and also knowing that I have grandchildren that I can't ever meet. 
Oh this is sad, to be fair he shouldn't of told you.  Your feelings are valid and I'm not sure how you can make this right. Maybe he could voice to the families you would love to a friend to the child but it is their child so prepare for a no.
Hw should have let you know. It is also unfair to donate if he knows you are not comfortable with it. It is great that he is helping friends, but if it effects his family you guys should at least be a part of thr discussion.
Why? He's his own person, an adult and can make his own decision. It doesn't effect his parents in any way they should have a say on. He might have just not tell her at all, if he knew she would've had problems with it, but it's a good way to make sure your will is being fulfilled if you die and frankly, I wouldn't have expected that to be a problem myself if I were in a similar simulation.

Donating sperm is not the same as having a child with someone, you're enabling them to have a child. It will have his genetics, but in all other ways, legally and socially, they will be the children of the couples he donated to, into which he consented. Not letting these children know is, until they're adults, probably also better for their upbringing given the (stupid) stigma adoption already has.

He's as much a father of these children as a surrogate mother is, or to make it more clear, as if he donated any other organ the mother needed to live and to make the children herself. Or as much as an artist owns the painting he made if he consented into selling it and having no rights. Just that the paining isn't conscious and won't have any problems with knowing his owner isn't his maker, which is why a signature is okey in that case - but again, he consented into these things. He had full knowledge of the consequences, noone lied to him, he doesn't even seem to complain (rightfully so) because he thinks about doing it again. If he regretted it, he wouldn't repeat it.

I get that one can struggle with this, and to OP I say that it's okey to be confused with this knowledge, but you should neither tell your son to not do it just because you think it's wrong if he thinks differently. You can tell him why it's wrong in your eyes, but it is his decision, and influencing him, or even making him feel bad about something he already did and seems to not feel bad about is not cool.

Also, wanting these kids to inherit his possessions is, in the same way, not something that I'd support as they're just not as much his kids. But I do get to feel that they somehow are; it's just important to keep in mind that he did all this voluntarily, and it's also his choice who inherits his possessions. He could appoint the neighbour, a homeless person or Obama to inherit it for all anyone else should care; biological relation does not equal right to anything of that relative's life in any way.
He is putting these kids in his will. He may not be a father figure, but he is on these kids' lives. It does effect his family. His kid may want to know his siblings. Besides, any big decision should be between partners. 
yes, it's still his decision, and his decision alone. through the will they'll find out about him being their father, but I'd say that's alright, considering the circumstances and that they'll likely be adults by that time - of course, it might be appropriate to tell them once they're grown up anyway. still, it's not his decision to let them know, so he definitely should talk to the parents before doing this.

still it doesn't effect his family in any way that's their concern. it's his life, and his stuff, and he can do what he wants with it. noone should, and can, complain about that - and complaining about not getting an inheritance you think you "deserve", especially if your reason is just biological relation, is rightfully so considered a huge, arrogant dick move.

They're not his kid's siblings, in any social or legal way. Just biological. He might want to know anyway, of course, but he'd try to find them and that'd be, again, against the wishes of the parents, so he shouldn't tell to prevent that until he is allowed to.

Decisions that effect both, yes, and it's great to ask for input before big decisions for just your own life - but when did his mother become his partner? I don't see any mention in OPs post about a marriage, or relationship. And the couples he donated to seem to have made the decision of accepting a donation together (and even if not, that's not really his concern, even though he should, for ethical reasons, decline if he found it the person he donated to would be lying to their partner).
If you are on a relationship you have to consider more ths  just you. This man is going off and habing kids with a bunch of people without any thoughts of how it will effect them. It is a big deal. If I found out my husband was handing out sperm to anyone who asked without even talking about it I would be pissed. Yes, it is his descion, but since it effects our family it would be pretty decietful to not say anything.
If you have a loving partner you should talk about this stuff, of course, out of respect, but I still don't see any mention of a partner, even a future one, in OPs post? The last part of the post talks about donating to a third couple who plans to have a family, not that HE plans to have one.

If he ever starts a relationship he should definitely mention this. But it should not be a thing for her, it's his life, and especially for actions before that relationship she has no say in it. She still wouldn't if he did it during the relationship, even though it'd be respectful to talk about it first, but as much as he doesn't have a right on her ovaries and their content, she doesn't have a right on his balls and their content.

And no. It doesn't effect your family. How would it? He doesn't have any rights to the children, rightfully so, and it's his decision what to do with his inheritance. Noone has a right on his stuff except him. Not even a wife, or a husband. It makes legal sense to give possessions to a partner in case of accidents, or to close family, but that's not a right - that's a lack of a better solution. (I'm all for 100% inheritance tax anyway.)
If he has no relationship with kids then why should they be in his will? It is all a bit odd. Of course she should not fault him for what they did before the relationship, but it should have come up.
I have no idea, but that's something to ask him, not to just assume - and especially not to assume based on your (generally speaking) values in family. I definitely agree it to be odd.

Please, tell me where you see any mention of him having a partner?
I apologize. I have been ill and I swear I read this as the OP's partner, not her son. I guess my blood sugar really was off! Yeah, her son doesn't have to get permission. I thought the OP hada son with a man whowas donating sperm.
I assumed something like this. No harm done. If that'd have been the case, you'd definitely be way more right. I'd want to know something like that too, even though it is technically not my right. :)
Take care of your blood sugar. That shit's important, yo. ^^
I was so confused. I was like, if my husband did this I would be so pissed. But kids are allowed to choose whatever they want for their lives, even of the parents don't agree.
I just got diagnosed a little over a week ago. But it was almost 400. I just got it to normalish levels. I definitely misread this.
No worries, all good. You re-read, you admitted the mistake and you apologized, that's the most perfect outcome for something noone is at fault for. Take care of yourself :)

I' at least be bummed he didn't ask me, but that's just rational. No idea how it'd be emotionally; I mean, it still wouldn't effect us and it's his body & choice, but it's indisputably a big thing and talking about these things should be standard; if not for permission, then at least for advice.
Absolutely. It is hard to watch your kids go down paths you see as risky. But ultimately, it is their right. 
Why is sperm donation risky?
Not the donation itself, but I mean later in life if tje kids want to know him and he doesn't want it. It may not cause any issues at all. I can understand being sad about having grandkids you never get to meet.
Well, he wants them to inherit his stuff, so there's no reason to assume he'd prevent that. The parents could, but also only until they're adults. ^^

Also, I do get that, but that's based on the premise they actually are your grandkids. They are biologically, but not legally and also not socially, both of which would be the reasons to want to know them, I'd assume? I do get confusing these things, but that is something to consider. ^^
I understand. I know my parents would be so upset if they never had the chance to meet my biological kids. But I know other people would be okay with if. It sounds like he gave people in need a precious gift.
I am a complete loss.  I've been with is mom and he's lived with since he was 6.  His father basically disowned him.  He's had various behavior issues, mainly anger management.  He's on various meds but I truly believe he is bipolar but docs seem reluctant to put that diagnoses on him even though he is on two different bipolar meds. We once had him involuntarily commited.  We take him to the needed docs and psychs so he is getting all the treatment but pretty damn sure he's not taking meds like he is supposed to. 

But here is the problem.  He is an A-B student per his IQ test.  All through HS he has been lazy and underperformed failing many classes and is just barely graduating.  He has no drivers license and no job. Refuses to drive my Suburban as he says it is to big.  My wife has a new Pathfinder that isn't much smaller which he isn't allowed to drive anyways as it's new.  He's made as close to zero effort to find a job.  It appears with a little luck we may have gotten him a job cleaning tables

He graduates next month with no license, no job and no way to go to college, even a community college as he has no transportation. (no public and with our work schedules we can't take him.)  He'll be 18 and since he isn't going to school will have no insurance so no more docs or meds.  First ER visit his credit will be ruined.  Tried explaining this for years and just doesn't seem to care. 

Me and my wife both agree he is not just going to be a leach but don't want to put him on the street. He has the capability to do something with his life but is just lazy to the extreme.  His goal is to be a Chief and their is a local CC that offers a program but won't take the steps to make it happen.  We even told him we'd buy him a car if he'd get his license and a job.  Just at a loss.  I feel I've failed somewhere along the lines but need some ideas on what to do at this point. We've tried to what we think are the right things by educating him on money, responsibility, getting him mental health help but nothing seems to be working. 

My daughter is the complete opposite.  Straight A's, motivated and other than a bit of a smart ass couldn't ask for much more. 

Maybe we are just shitty parents and don't realize it.  I hate to see him fail and end up going down the wrong path but just plain out of ideas of what to do with him. 
Let him fail. Don't provide a safety ney. Set an ultimate. Eotjer he take steps to be independent or he is out of the house. It is tough love. 
I moved in with my dad and his gf a year ago ..Mom kicked me out two years ago. It's becoming very hard to connect with her, every time we go out, her and my dad speak Spanish and I always feel left out. I really do hate it and feel like she doesn't like me anymore. If I had a step son that moved in my house and he knew English, and I knew a little English, I would talk to him with the English I know. She doesn't. I talk to her in English and there are a lot of silences and miscommunication. 
You moved in with them. Why should she accommodate you?
The best way that I've learned is by being naturally curious and talking to people. Asking about everyday items and activities. Listening to music is a really good way. Watch some telenovelas with her. Lol. I'm sure that's a great bonding experience even if you don't understand what's going on. 
Words are only one form of communication, you can connect in many various ways. How do those who can't speak have loved ones? 

There are many ways to connect you just need to take the initiative. What does she like to do? Do you have any common interests? What about food? Maybe the two of you can cook together, even if you can't cook and she can, just watch her, help her out. When you are cooking pick up an egg and say "huevos" she'll smile and nod, pick up milk and ask what this is, she will tell you. Small steps!!

Love is a language of it's own, everybody speaks it and understands it in their own way, all you need to do is take the first step. You guys will learn to communicate together. 
 So we can build a bond together and I want to get to know her but I can't because of the language barrier. 
Since that's your intention, one of the best ways to build a bond is attempting to learn another's language and culture. I tried learning Mandarin so I could speak to my ex-wife's grandmother. 

Some people simply aren't comfortable or confident in not speaking their first language. Besides, I'm sure if the tables were flipped and she lived in your home, she would speak in English. Besides, when people are older, they're more set in their ways. Plus, again, you're in their home. There's a respect factor that goes into it. Forcing her to speak English in her own home is plain old rude. 


Yes a bond can't grow without us communicating. I talk to everyone, her sons and my dad. We've all bonded. It's just me and her that is the problem. I don't know how I would learn Spanish, I've failed the classes in school. She's told me before that she would be embarrassed for not knowing another language and being clueless all the time. 
Then I guess there won't be a bond. 

In my experience, I've learned that if something is important enough to me, that I should take the initiative instead of expecting others to do it for me. 
Good advice. How would I go about learning a different language?
OP you are wearing me out. r/Spanish

What do you do when your brother tries to commit incest with you and years later, when you tell you're family, he just convinces your family youre crazy?
(Edit) family is from west Virginia. Im sure that doesn't help
You stay away from all of them.
Wondering how old you are? Could you Reach out to a family member that doesn't live close by to live with them? If you're an adult you need to get out of there and /or call the police. Sexual assault is sexual assault even if it was attempted. If you're in school... You can talk to a guidance counselor. I hope the best for you. If you have no way to get away.... I would buy a lock for your door and take self defense classes. Please be safe... We don't get to pick our families and that makes it difficult but just because they're family it doesn't mean they have your best interest in mind. 

Except I live with them?
True story. Thank you.
And im 28.

I have lived with an emotionally abusive single father for all of my life, there has been physical abuse here and there. It has been nearly constant, I have gotten diagnosed with some disorders due to the living conditions. There are good times when we laugh and joke around, but most of the time, things are very dark. I have felt this way for almost 10 years, and I know my living conditions could be worse, but they are already very bad.

I am planning on going to college this summer in a different state, he knows that. But I won't be moving out for another few months, and things are getting bad again, and some of my friends and their parents are telling me that I need to leave ASAP. 

My current situation is this: My grandparents are in town until the 30th. My dad said he is going to punish me as soon as they leave, I won't go into detail but he is a war veteran with severe PTSD and things get really bad when he is angry. One example is he found out I was dating a boy (I was 16) and he freaked out, took away all of my forms of communication, and banned me to my house for an entire summer. This included no visits from friends. This isn't very harsh in terms of what he COULD do, but shows his skewed mindset. And for the record, that boy and I are still dating and have been for 2 and a half years. My dad always says he is going to hurt him.

I am currently unemployed, but I am graduating tomorrow and I am more than happy to get a job, and I am planning on getting one definitely. 

I have a few friends' houses lined up that I could go to and temporarily live in before going to college. (I would do everything in my power to repay their families).

I am over 18, graduating high school very soon, and applying to go to college. College starts in August.

So my question is this:

What can I do to make leaving as legal as possible and as safe as possible? If he finds me after I leave, or finds a way to legally bind me to live with him, I do not know if I will ever see the sun again. Are there any legal documents I should begin making copies of? 

It has been suggested to me to get a restraining order on him. Is this suggested by you guys?

Thank you, and please help. I only have 10 days to do this correctly. 

────────
You're 18?? Then you are free to go. He can't legally bind you to do anything. He doesnt own you. In fact... Now that you are an adult, any way he punishes you would be seen as bad.. For example.. When he kept you in the house as punishment all summer, that could now potentially be seen as kidnapping.
If he were to hit you, that would now be seen as assault. If he tried to find you/follow you, that would now be seen as harassment.

If your friends are letting you stay with them go and try to find a job. Good luck to you and please make a follow up post if its not too much because I am curious to know how this turns out.
Wait until he is at work and pack and leave. Don't tell him where you are going. There is nothing binding you to him. If he withholds any documentation, like your birth certificate, go to the police.
Thank you. I'll try doing a follow up post if possible, not sure how my situation is going to be within a month or so but I'll definitely try updating
Thank you so much. I was nervous about leaving to college and being unable to get important documents back to me, but I will look into going to the police if I need to. Thank you 
End of summer update would be cool!!! Only if you want though. Thanks and good luck
I'm beginning to lose respect for my mother because she's so delusional.she believes that she did the best for us and always brings that up whenever me and my sister have childish fights, for example she will always say "i raised all of you to be good children, i cannot do anything anymore because you (her children) really behave like animals" what do you expect? You have the parenting skill of a wall! I know we should learn about manners and stuff on our own because we are grown ups, but it's a vital factor in shaping our character.

Another thing i really hate about her is she didn't teach us about practical things, i learned washing the dishes when i was 12 and now im already a 15 yo this year and I can't even cross the road!

She's also a control freak, because of that i missed a good deal of my childhood like doing outdoor activities with other children  and as a result I don't know how to make friends and I'm now a socially awkward nolife teen.

And lastly, she doesn't care at all and acts as if she's uneducated, if i talk to her about stuff that i dont want her to do in a professional manner she raises her voice like she wants people around to know. And although this one isn't really a problem i just cant leave this one, she leaves her underwear in the bathroom faucet and i am forced to wash my hands in the kitchen
While your mom should teach ypu stuff you are old enough to figure it out for yourself. YouTube is great for tutorials. Take the initiative, be your own person. It sounds like your mom has tried to help you, but you didn't like or appreciate it. You can make yourself into someone you can bw proud if, it just takes some effort.
When i was younger than 10 i had less freedom than an indoor cat
Try working with your mom to earn more freedom.
She did it with the rest of my siblings so nope that wont work
My parents went away this weekend and left my 82 year old grandmother to look after my brother and until Monday morning.

Now my grandmother is an extremely unpleasant woman. She's a nasty, bitter old bat who never has anything nice to say about anyone and she's absolutely insane. She has an undiagnosed mental illness (or two) and there is so much wrong with her it's not even funny. Her anxiety is so severe she will literally look for things to be worried about (she won't let me drive anywhere this weekend for no reason at all other than she's a nervous wreck.)

And I don't mean to stir the pot but she's also insanely religious and conservative. Needless to say, she's "a product of her time" to put it as lightly as I can, and often raves about things like how the country is going to hell because of abortion or some shit. She believes in very traditional values. Unbeknownst to her, I am a bisexual atheist and I hope she never finds out as long as she lives (but she totally will... if my see-you-next-tuesday of a great aunt doesn't find out first.)

In that vein, she is quite verbally abusive, even when that abuse is cloaked in so-called "love."

I remember when my brother and I were kids, we were cutting up and she yells at us about how we don't behave well and warned us "One day you're going to give your mother a nervous breakdown and she'll have to be put away in a mental hospital and you won't have a mother." That scared the shit out of me.

This is pretty random but I also remember one time she told me that I was going to start smoking one day. Joke's on you! I've never picked up a cigarette a day in my life and don't plan on starting.

It gets even better! When my cousin was born two years ago, we visited my older cousin (baby's dad) and his fiancee in the hospital to meet the baby and grandma actually badgered me about when I'm going to get married and have kids of my own, and when I told her "never," she asked me if I was gay. I just said "no," but inside I'm like "staaaaahp."

Still, I can't help feeling sorry for her. This poor woman grew up impoverished in the Great Depression and her father was not a very good man, like he was a drunk and abusive from what I gather. Her husband (my grandpa) died when I was just a toddler and she is always alone, and she has tremendous health problems. She is morbidly obese and can barely get up and down steps, and she also has an autoimmune disorder that attacks her joints or something. I do feel a sliver of pity for her, but that shouldn't excuse the patronizing way she treats me.

If you're thinking "oh, she's just some bratty teenager who thinks she knows everything" here's the catch: I am 22 and my brother is 20. You would think we're okay on our own but my brother is severely autistic and has a low IQ (think Forest Gump) so that adds an extra challenge. He's too mentally defective to recognize toxic people so he doesn't realize what a terrible influence grandma is and just thinks "oh, she brings me cookies and donuts!!" My mother has actually rebuked grandma on multiple occasions and told her to STOP bringing junk food into the house but no dice. I know overindulgent grandparents are a rather commonplace problem.

The truth is, however, my parents are more than okay with leaving the two of us alone. They trust me, I can drive, I have a job and money, my brother and I have the resources to feed ourselves and take care of ourselves. My grandmother just insists on coming over and driving us everywhere (even though she can't drive for shit) I don't know if it's because she's completely lonely or if she just wants to impose. I'm fairly certain that the only thing that will keep grandma from imposing on us is death (And even then her re-animated corpse will come back to check in on us!)

Being around my grandmother is absolutely exhausting and it's not a relationship I find particularly rewarding. I don't get much out of it except "Hey, happy birthday, here's $20." Everything was fine when I was younger, because she treated me like I was five. As I got older though I realized that she will not change the way she treats me no matter how old I get and she boils down to nothing more than a glorified babysitter. 

What should I do? I know for now I just have to suffer in silence and deal with her bullshit, but I don't know what to make of this relationship from now until her eventual passing. Should I distance myself from her? Am I in the wrong for thinking that she's just not a nice person? 
Family is a funny thing, they love us yet at the same time family is the one who treats us the worst and hurts us the most. I can't begin to understand what you are going through, I can't even imagine but as I've been growing up (33m) I've started to learn things about myself and how I was raised, it really taught me a lot about myself. I am lucky, I am able and have taken some time off work. I was over worked, I was an asshole all the time, I was just in a bad place. I took the time to work on myself and I really did learn about why I am the way I am, do the things I do. People go their entire lives without this opportunity, people don't know why they do the things they do, they just do them. I bet your grandmother never got the opportunity I did.

Just think about your grandmother, who was raised as you say in the depression with an abusive drunk father. I'd say she had to grow up a lot faster than you and I did, probably where the rough edges come from?

Now you say she's obese, I can speak from experience that there are a few things going on. She has a blood sugar issue, is she hasn't eaten in a while she's gonna be cranky. If she's too big to get food and too lazy to get food it can be why she's cranky. I know it sounds nuts, but it's true 3 years ago I was over 300 pounds and if my blood sugar was low I could snap for no stupid reason. When people are obese like I was, we don't have to eat a lot to stay fat or gain weight, because honestly I was probably an undiagnosed diabetic or prediabetic. Which can make losing weight hard and gaining it easier.

Also when you are fat, you just hate the world. You don't want to go out because you know people are staring and judging. It's very difficult living life as a big person, it's heart breaking and challenging. Your grandma probably tried to lose the weight and with no help or success might have given up. Trust me I tried so many times, there were months I'd eat so little work out so much and not lose a pound. It wasn't until I grabbed a laptop did some real work did I learn what I needed to do. I bet she didn't have those resources when she had the chance to do something about her weight. The only reason I did, my wife was diagnosed with a sugar issue, so I changed my diet with hers.

I'm not saying your grandmother is a great person and you're being childish, she and I would not get along. I 100% agree with you that her behavior is out of line, I'm just saying see her side of why she behaves the way she does. You're a grown ass adult, sit down one day after your brother is asleep and have a talk with the woman. A real sit down talk about what her life was like. Because I promise you two things, you'll appreciate her a lot 
more, she'll do the same for you and two one day you'll regret it if you don't. I come from an immigrant household so I rarely spent time with my grandparents, there was a language barrier as well and I regret that I didn't get to know my grandfather more. Trust me, what they grew up with and went through, it's fucking crazy!

I promise she loves you, she was raised by an abusive person it's what she knows. But the worst thing that happens is you waste a night talking with her and hearing some fun stories. But maybe you can actually connect with her enough to just get her to let you go out. Odds are she would never understand you as a person, but maybe she'll trust you enough to go out. 

All I know is that she loves you,  she cares she's just lonely, depressed and maybe finds it hard find something worth living for. I've had those days in my early thirties or late twenties imagine how she feels at her age. People won't change unless they have/see something worth changing for, so if you keep doing the same thing over and over she has no reason to treat you differently. Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same result. So maybe you should change your approach.


Finally, no you are not a bad person for feeling the way you do. You are young and it's always difficult to see things through your own eyes sometimes. Just a thought I hope everything works out!
I understand her watching your brother, bur not you. Tou should be free to come and go as you please. If ypu are truly stuck the do your best to tougj it out. It is just for the weekend.
Hey! It took me a while to read your reply because I was at work today, but thanks for your insights.

Today I am just so fucking angry with her because she almost poisoned our dog. Thankfully, the dog is okay, but that dog could easily be dead if we weren't careful. There is more information in another thread if you need more context.

Honestly, I think deep down she loves me, she just doesn't really know how to show it properly. I've tried to reason with her but I can't. At this point, it feels like I'm the adult and she's the child.

We have actually had great talks in the past. She told me about growing up during World War II, how her father chased away potential boyfriends with a shot gun, my late grandpa served in Korean War, stuff like that.

Something I realized today that was rather sad? I barely knew my other grandma (dad's mom.) From what I gather, she was sweet as pie. Sadly, my dad's parents lived in New Hampshire so I only met them maybe twice (I live in Pittsburgh.) She sadly lost a tough battle with Alzheimers in September 2015 and my grandpa lost his battle with prostate cancer a few months later... almost like that old couple in The Notebook. I never got to know them well. All I know about them I learned from my dad, and the things I learned about my family were so much more interesting, like I learned my grandpa (dad's dad) was involved in the Berlin airlift in World War II, and that on my dad's side we have a small amount of Native American ancestry. This whole time I thought we were just Irish! 

Anyway, this grandma (the bitchy dog-poisoning one) is the only grandparent I've ever known and I'm just like "how do people have like these sweet adorable grandmas??"

I will never understand how my mom is related to my grandma. My mom, we do have our mother-daughter disagreements, but she is just the sweetest woman in the world. That apple fell so far from the tree it's practically in the next backyard over.
My brother actually understands some fundamentals (taking dogs out, emptying dishwasher, etc.) but the no-car rule is a commitment I must honor. Even my parents think it's bull but again, she is in charge.
But she isn't there to watch you. It is frustrating. Best of luck getting through the weekend.
Thanks.

As I'm writing this, this morning she almost poisoned our dog and I am just so fucking mad at her.

We have two dogs - one puggle and one chihuahua. The Puggle will eat literally anything in her path. Anyway grandma had a pack of gum in her purse and this morning the dog ate the gum. I heard her yell "THAT GODDAMN DOG ATE MY GUM!"

I heard this and almost had a heart attack because most gum is poisonous to dogs. My brother and I were screaming because we had a similar incident happen a few years ago when she ate sugar free gum out of my purse and we had to get her stomach pumped. 

We couldn't take her to the vet because grandma.

All I can say is that I am completely grateful that the gum did not contain xylitol, because if it did my brother would have lost his best friend today.
She have had to pry the keys from my hands if the dog needed the vet. She sounds like she needs to be taken care of. I am sorry.
Who the dog or my grandma?
Your grandma!

I came back from work today expecting my boyfriend to be drinking again. But when I opened the door I saw him cradling my sister still in her school uniform, she was obviously upset. I asked if everything was ok and she turned around, her face was red and she had marks where she had been crying. 

My mum had phoned her before she got home and told her that she was getting divorced and told her to get herself something for her dinner because she wont be home until late and my dad isn't coming home. She told me that she came to my boyfriends as soon as she hung up. My mum didn't even have the heart to tell her face to face or to comfort her she just told her and hung up, she doesn't care about her children she just wants to be in charge.

I phoned my dad as soon as she told me, and asked what had happened. Apparently my dad had been arguing with my mum about treating me bad and she'd had enough, she told him "if your going to keep defending her, then you can kiss this marriage goodbye" and he did. He said he was staying at a friends house and asked how my sister was, then he had to go. 

My boyfriend told me when she got here he opened the door and she ran in looking for me, but when he told her I was still working she couldnt hold it any longer, she fell to the floor and burst out crying, she told him what happened and he helped her off the floor and sat her down on the sofa comforting her until I showed up 20 minutes later.

My boyfriend got up and went into our bedroom and I heard some banging and he came out with some of my spare clothes and a single mattress (that he had from his old bed) and said if she needed a place to stay where she felt safe, she could stay here and he started setting up a bed frame in the spare room. Its been a few hours and my mum hasn't even phoned my sister to see if she is ok. She says she wants to stay the night.

Im in the bath right now but I can hear my boyfriend talking to my sister about what she did at school and what she wants to eat because it's her choice. She said that mum is going to kill her and he jokingly said "it's me who has to worry, now I've taken both her daughters". He is trying to help her settle. I dont think she can stay if my mum says no because she and my father have custody but if they are divorcing then my depending what happens, my sister might be stuck with my mum and that means I wont be able to see her. I dont know if I should tell her or let things take their course. But I'm scared for her and I can't help but feel responsible for everything that has happened.

TL;DR: My parents have split up, my sister is in the middle and it's my fault
Your mother is psycho, its not your fault
I agree with everyone else. This is not your fault. Your mom has some serious issues and she is using this situation to either push something she has wantes for a long time or she has lost it.
Honey, I concur with u/fukinlegend - this is not your fault, regardless of whatever kind of BS garbage spews from your egg donor's vile lips. It sounds as though this was a long time coming and your father is a saint for putting up with her brand of crazy as long as he did. Things will be rough for a bit, but you'll find out how much better the whole family (dad, sis, you) will be once the nutjob is out of your lives.
You and your bf seem like very thoughtful, kind people and I am happy to hear that your father would not back down from defending you. They are getting divorced because of your mother's behavior, NOT because of you. If it wasn't you it'd probably have been something else, or worse your 'lil sister! I have a feeling things are going to be alright for you. You're awesome, keep that sh*t up!
My sister went to sleep at about 10 and my mum hadn't even phoned her to see if she was ok. At half past 1 in the morning my mum phoned her I answered because she was sleeping and I was watching some tv because I couldn't sleep. Mum asked why she was with me and I told her "you left her on her own she came to me because you don't care about her". She didn't respond and hung up. If my sister hadn't come to me then she would have been on her own until half past 1 or whenever my mum returned from whatever she was doing. I have tommorow off work so my boyfriend says he will drop my sister off at school and then we're going to go see my dad to see what is happening with my sister. I just want my mum to have nothing to do with her. It kills me to see my sister upset and I don't want to send her back to my mum. I will update when I know more
thank you very much, I appreciate the kind words.
You are a good sister. You are handling this very well.
That means a lot thank you. My dad phoned my sisters school and said that there is a family issue and she wont be going to school today. We went to see my dad and he can't take my sister in because he's sofa surfing and has no where to live full time so until he finds a stable home thats a no. He says he will give my sister permission to stay wherever she wants as long as my mum agrees.

We went to go to my mums to ask her. My boyfriend waited outside and me and my sister went in. My mum is delusional and it screwed her over. She thought my sister would decide to stay with her. She said to my sister "you can stay where you want but I think we both know you would rather have a room to yourself". My sister said she has a room to herself and has decided to stay with me and my boyfriend. Mum says my sister isn't thinking straight and should come home. She told mum " *clickynocks* looked after me when you didn't' I want to stay there".

My mum started shouting and throwing things at me saying my sister can take nothing we are dead to her. My boyfriend heard the slamming and came it to see what happened and she threw a glass at him. It broke and now he has a cut going accross his cheek. We phoned the police and my boyfriend is trying her for assault. But now my sister is staying with me and my boyfriend and for the first time all week things are starting to look up.
You are 100% right to file a report. Your mom sounds like she is having some kind of mental illness issue. This is so out there. I am so sorry you are dealing with this. 
She has to pay a fine and compensate my boyfriend for the injury. She also has to make a verbal apology infront of an officer, call me cruel but it will make me happy to see her squirm. 
After what she is putting you through, I get it. Part of me hopes she won't behave in front of the officer and will get arrested. She needs someone to show her crazy is not to be tolerated.
It would do the world a favour if she was locked up. But unfortunately she behaved. I could see that she hated saying it.  My boyfriend got a few stitches the cut was a few centermeters on his left cheek it barely missed his eye the doctor said if it had hit the eye he might of had severe retinal damage? but he's ok.
My sister was happy this morning, when we lived with our parents she was groggy and grumpy but this morning she got up and her attitude was completely different. She said she slep well and she loves it here, gave me a hug and then left for school. I'm not working today so I'm going to get her some clothes because my mum kept all hers
It's cool that you're all happy now, I hope it stays that way you deserve a break from the grief you've been getting.
I'm sick of holding all this inside me.

For the longest time, my sister [26F] and I [24M] have been butting heads and simply can't get along.

Here are my frustrations with her and some of the reasons why I can't do this:

1) Anything I do - she shows disgust. For example - during a family vacation trip, whenever I was taking a selfie or having a picture taken of me by another family member, I would catch her showing a disgusted face in the background. She doesn't do this with any of my other family members; just me. This still occurs today. Pictures are just one example, of course. Suppose I crack a joke with other family members or do some fun, humourous action to make others laugh. I get the same look from her.

2) On another (recent) family vacation trip, she did not want to sit with me during dinner. This happened on multiple occasions whenever I sat next to her during a restaurant dinner. "Can you sit over there instead?" she would say.

3) She painted a false picture of me amongst her social circle. When I was 15-18, we had some pretty hectic clashes. She would then go and vent her one-sided stories to her friends, telling them all how horrible I was. There were several times I overheard her talking about me (to her friends) on the phone. Now I have a villainous / evil reputation amongst her social circle. This is ongoing.

4) Anytime I speak up, assert an opinion or suggestion, she disregards my input and retorts to, "You think you're so high and mighty." Due to her inability to reason, challenge my viewpoints, or see me as someone who could actually know a thing or two, the "high and mighty" statement is the only card she'd play. Psychologically, this suppressed my ability to speak out assertively because I'm always stifled by this "you think you're high and mighty" voice in the back of my head.

5) She always finds some way to assert a negative comment about my character. "You're selfish. Self-centered. A control freak. You care only about yourself." These comments usually occur whenever it is based around food or some other petty reason. I am a bit sensitive when someone takes a jab at my character - especially a family member. Working on trying to fix this by being more unreactive and letting it go.

6) Furthermore, any opportunity she sees to take a jab at my character - she goes for it. When I share a story (to my family) about something awkward I did? Her comment: "You're so socially awkward." When there's a bad picture of me? "That's his usual face." I make a mistake or do something wrong? "You're so dumb, etc." 

7) In some way, I feel she doesn't like my physical appearance or voice. My voice sounds childish and high-pitched sometimes; maybe she sees me as the "younger child" sibling. She's definitely called me ugly several times though. She is a VERY shallow and closed-minded person ("I only like [a specific race, which I won't say] guys!"). I think my appearance may have had some influence in her disgust of me, especially during my teenage years. It's hard to see it this way, I know. However, there are some very subtle cues as well as my own sense of intuition that bring me to make this point.

8) Unfortunately, I don't look up to her and have little respect for her. She has not done anything I can really be proud about. She does not put in effort or hard work into anything she does. She values her "social life" over the family. Instead of celebrating dad's recent birthday at home, she went out with friends. This is just one of many examples. At 26 years old, she has shown little desire to move forward in life. **She's still working at a retail job earning minimal wage and has never - in her life - had a boyfriend (go figure).** Whenever I give her suggestions or tips - once again, I get the "you think you're so high and mighty" card. Instead, she spends her time going out, partying in the city, spending money on clothes & shopping, and wasting time overall. All the while living at her parents' expense. We have encouraged her to find a better job, but she has not made any attempt in doing so. It's hard to respect or sympathize with someone who constantly does this and shows no effort in changing.

My parents continue to enable her to live this lifestyle and have not really done anything to help her change either. Hell, my mother can't even have a conversation about her life without it turning into a loud argument.

I don't want to admit that I'm not at fault during some of these quarrels. Sometimes I do overreact and insult her during many of these arguments. We all have blindspots; it's tough to step out of your frame and accept another person's perspective about yourself. However, she is really the ONLY person that I can't genuinely get along with. I have another sibling (21M brother) and we are VERY close.

TLDR; my sister causes me a lot of stress and negativity. I don't think I will ever be able to genuinely connect.
Your sister is petty. Don't let her ruin your confidence. It sounds like you are doing alright as an adult and she is having some difficulties. It is easier for jealous and angry than take responsibility for herself. Ignore her. She will either get over or you will eventually not spend time with her.
If you can establish some sort of comradery with your parents and brother I think you'll be fine. she seems like someone whose opinion shouldn't matter, after all she can't do any serious damage to you other than ruin your reputation with the social circle (which, considering who she is, shouldn't be something you would want to care about). It's heavy to have a member of your family to behave like this. Try to move on with your life and have the least contact with her you can, maybe she'll burn out when she'll see you moving on with life and relationships. Best of luck
Let me first say i am not trolling, or trying to get an (over)reaction out of anyone for what i am saying. I am really looking for some help.

So here is the thing, for some reason i hate my whole family. I have no idea why, or what they did to make me hate them. Even though i live only 5 miles from where they live i have not seen them in over 6 years and the only times i talked to them is when i get a call on my phone from an unknown number. My mom practically begged me a few weeks ago when she called to come and visit, and i reluctantly said yes for today. But today i just blew them off and played some Factorio instead.

I practically have no interest whatsoever in seeing or talking to any of my family. I have a younger brother who i have not had a conversation with since i left to live on my own when i was 18 years old (which is now 15 years ago). I have had a pretty normal childhood, my parents did not abuse me or punish me (in a fair way, looking at it back now) if i did not deserve it.

I am except this part a pretty normal guy, i have a steady job, i have few friends and i have had several longtime girlfriends in the past. I am not using any drugs or have any serious addictions (except maybe gaming). I am not suffering from any mental illness (that i know off) and i am quite intelligent.

So why do i not want anything to do with my family? Whenever i was around them in the past i always felt miserable, and i could not get away fast enough. This is not normal right? What is wrong with me? Also if i want a better relationship with them, what should i do?
Sounds to me as if there's a deeply-hidden cause for your feelings.  Have you tried hypnosis therapy?
In my experience, photographs help to build familial bonds. See if your parents have any old family photographs that you could look through together. 

Also, get them both together and tell them up front that you want a better relationship. Take it slow, visit more often, get involved. Find a way to make it fun.

And call your mom today. 
When I was a kid my dad would ask me simple math questions, they were easy to answer but when I did answer he would be like "you sure" and I'd be like "yeah" then him "completely sure" and of be like"no" 
He wanted you to get a pencil and paper and do the problem so that, if you were wrong, he could show you where the mistake was; and if you were right you could defend your answer to him with the proof.  This is common in college.  Once you have written a master's thesis you have to defend it to a panel of professors.  He probably wanted you to get so used to the experience that, if you went on to get a higher-level education, the process would be so familiar to you that you'd only have to concentrate on your work.  If he meant to make you feel foolish or stupid he'd have chosen different, harsher words and insulted you with name-calling.  Next time he does this go get that pencil and paper, and prove to him you know your stuff! :) 
:)

I'm 26. After graduating college I hit some bumpy road: I realized I had always been a bit immature, with social anxiety that kind of kept me in my comfort zone. So several times since then I've found myself living at home, including now.

I've had a lot of realizations about myself and my family and why I am the way I am. Part of it is because I was the only boy and the middle sibling of two sisters, and another part is that I have an overprotective and strong-willed mother and a sensitive, super family-oriented father. 

Going to focus on my dad here. He's always been caring, and the type that just stays at home most of the time (when not at work) strumming on his guitar by himself, and evening singing to himself.  I never saw anything he did as being out of the ordinary until a few years ago. I know I can't change who he is on his own time, but one thing he does is that he still calls me "bud" often, and I think now that the fact that he always did that kept me from growing up when I was in high school (along with things my mom did). At 65 and 26 respectively, is this normal? Part of me thinks maybe I'm immature to be worrying about this, but from what I see, fathers of my friends call their sons by their name. 

What I want is for my dad to see that at some point our relationship has to change. Even though part of me thinks that might be impossible because of how he is, I'm hoping maybe the change might open his eyes. I've become more mature than him in some ways (IMO), and I don't like it. The idea of taking with him about it seems strange. I think he never really became self-aware of his role in the family as the father of three children and the husband of my mom, and how he has to separate himself from those roles in order to fulfill them. He is always just HIMSELF. His daydreaming, loner, self.

If anyone has had a similar experience I would really appreciate advice on how you were able to change and grow and still keep a relationship with your family.
Rralizing younare immature is a good first step. You also need to underdtsnd that you are responsible for ypur own actions. Being called buddy shouldn't hold you back. It can be hard to hard an adult relationship with your parents. Ir takes time. Show them you are an adult. It will go a long way to helping things.
The name isn't the big deal. If you want to be mature, calmly ask him to use your real name.

The big deal is not being mature, know what I mean?
After a divorce, me and the woman who used to be my step mother still keep in touch often, but according to my father he still gets texts from her months after the break up, her trying to reconnect. How would I know if I'm being used in this situation? She rarely asks me what my dad is doing, or how he's doing, she texts me and genuinely seems interested in my life and still wants me to tell her  how school is going and how my therapy is going and everything and telling me she still sees me as a son, but my dad tells me she contacts him often saying she misses him and everything, and she told me they both moved on. I don't know if she's just trying to keep me out of the drama or what. Yesterday she told me she was going to text me today to remind me to not to forget something, and earlier today my dad said she tried to reconnect with him, he shut her down and now I haven't heard anything from her, but its still early in the day though. How do I know if I'm being used so she can try to get back with my dad? I wonder if she really truly moved on, would she still want to keep in touch? After there split I offered no contact, just to make things easier for everyone and 3 days afterwards she contacted me. I'm confused, but she never asks me personal info on my dad or anything, and she never tried to use me as a messenger, just every rare text conversation we have she sometimes asks me what my dads doing or how my dad is, but thats never too often. Is it possible that she does miss my dad, but genuinely cares about me to? 
It's definitely possible she misses you both separately. Depending on the relationship dynamic and how long she was part of your family. I dated a woman recently with a child for the first time (in our 20s) and I miss her daughter more than I miss her when it's all said and done. 

How long was she around, and how was your relationship when she was with your pops?
She sounds like she cares for you. Hoe long were she and your dad together? If she has been in tour life for a while, it is likely she does see you as a son. Beware of being pulled into drama. I think you are in the clear.

I'm a child of divorce myself, and I've dealt with several step fathers and one wonderful step mother. It sounds to me like she does care about you. Be sure to give that back, though. It's possible she's just as scared of you ghosting on her as you are. If you want her in your life, keep her there. 
Just over a month ago, I got an unexpected text from my uncle at 7:04 am saying: “your mom is back in the hospital.” This was 2 days after she was discharged into a skilled nursing facility after being in the hospital in a coma for over a month prior…

I immediately called the hospital and the operator came on the phone. I gave her my mother’s name and she transferred me to a different line. I gave that person my mother’s name… That person then transferred me again. It seemed as though no one would tell me what was going on and why my mother was back in the hospital after just being discharged. 

I finally got transferred to a young girl who asked my relation and what I knew. I told her I received a text from my uncle that my mother was back in the hospital and now I’m on the phone with her. She didn’t say anything at first. She took a deep breath and said “I just started my shift at 7 am and I will tell you what I know. At 4:50 this morning the nurses checked on your mother and she was asleep. At 5:30 am they checked on her again and her heart wasn’t beating and she wasn’t breathing. They called for an ambulance and when she got here, there wasn’t anything we could do.”

It didn’t click in my mind that she was gone. It took a minute and I felt as though this girl had no idea what she was talking about. So I asked her “what are you saying?” she didn’t say anything, and her silence was all it took for me to realize what she had just told me. “So, you’re saying… she’s gone?” is all I could say. “She’s gone, I’m sorry” she replied.

I immediately fell into my bed in disbelief, sobbing with the phone still to my ear for what seemed like forever.

It's these moments in life in which nothing can prepare you for the amount of immediate pain and numbness you feel.

You keep holding your breath until you get light headed, hoping it goes away, but it doesn't. You keep trying to wake up, hoping you'll wake up from this horrible dream, but you don’t. You look at everything around you for something that looks familiar, but everything is blank. The shock of everything is so surreal.

I thought my life would never be the same again.

Many of my friends hovered for support, trying to understand and relate to what I was going through, but they just couldn’t. Being the very closed off person I am, I kept to myself.

I hid the tears and all the heartache from everyone because I didn’t know how to be vulnerable. I told everyone that I was okay, but deep down I was lost, confused and angry. At times I felt like I couldn’t even think for myself. 

All of this happened to me, I couldn’t imagine how my 11 year old brother feels. After our mother passed, his father signed over his rights to me. I now have custody of him and I am his legal guardian. 

The holiday that is upon us: Mother’s Day… I’m not sure what to do, for him or myself. 

Many people have dealt with the grief of losing a parent or loved one, and they are very familiar with the foreshadowing of pain that usually follows Mother’s Day. It’s difficult to convince myself to celebrate this day the same way. In the past, this day was always one for admiration and love; it was a day that encouraged you to show your gratitude for the woman who brought you into this world., but after you lose your mother, it almost seems as though the day’s only purpose is to remind you of your loss.

I am so sorry. What an awful way to find out. It sounds like your uncle chickened out of telling you. You can do a few things. You can ignore the holiday all together if you feel like it. It would be completely understandable. Or you could have your mom's favorite meal and watch a movie that she would have liked or her favorite movie. Or you could go out ro do something to take your mind off things, but risk running into families ehi arr celebrating. There is no wrong way to go about this. Be honest with each other. It is okay to want to talk about her and okay if you can't. Support one another. Cry if you need to. It is okay to be sad. It is okay to miss her. It is okay if you celebrate it and it is okay if you can't. Maybe you can get your brother some kind of keepsake that represents the realtionship he had with your mom. Maybe a picture in a personalized frame or something that would be meaningful to him. Best of luck. Sometimes it is easier to talk to a stranger. I know I bave said it before, but I am here if you want to talk.
A fascination with superheroes can benefit a child in many ways, including boosting their self-esteem and making them feel powerful.

In some cases, superheroes can teach children how to be strong.


Children first depend on their parents for love and protection.
But as they grow older, they begin to admire role models who embody the same power and positivity

By identifying with the heroes and superheroes of culture, children can begin to feel that they are aligned with what is right and that they can develop their own agency, power and value in the world


Of course, there are always the classic arguments against children having an interest in superheroes.
They are demarketing strategies, they bring children to reality.

There are concerns that children get the wrong idea, seeing themselves as heroes or victims in the future, are valid concerns, but they still see superheroes as good at influencing children.


Once children understand that they are fictional characters, they can begin to distinguish between how things work in the land of superheroes and how they work in the real world

After understanding all this I hope that the superheroes continue to increase the imagination

These videos show the happiness of the children when feeling superheroes
I put some videos to illustrate the developed in the subject

Hi, so I guess this is a big boom for a first time poster, uh?

Basically I'm just so tired. Though not diagnosed, I'm pretty sure my mom suffers from some kind of mental illness, I think it is depression. She had a skin condition which only made it worse and gave it the occasion to arise. She's angry at my dad, she hates him, she tries to bring him and us sons apart, she herself always argues with us, she won't seek for help. I tried to be comforting, understanding, than angry and demanding, now I'm just growing cold but at the same time I don't want to destroy what me and my mom had- the strongest love a daughter could have for her mom. I just know that I'd only get hurt by her if I get closer to her again. Is anyone in this same situation? How the fuck do you deal with it? 
I just feel like I'm wasting precious time. Many people don't even get to know their parents and here I am, scared to love my mom.
Me and my mom aren't close either. She is the reason why I became severely depressed in the first place and her attempts at chancing have been complete failures. This is tearing me apart because she never meant any harm to anyone, she simply didn't know how to act. When I look at her I see 2 different people:
1. The first person is someone who screamed at me my whole life. She was always controlling me, choosing my hobbies for me and telling me how to act. She never supported me and only ever told me to do better. This is the mom I grew up with. This is how I saw her for 15 years.
2. The second person is someone who never meant any harm but didn't know how to raise kids. A victim of her own shitty upbringing. A person who allowed her own personal issues cloud her judgment and made some stupid decisions. She wasn't ready to be a mother but after a life of shit made one bad judgment call at the height of her happiness.  This is who she really is. A victim of her own life who unintentionally shared that pain.

I'm stuck having to choose between these 2 people. At the moment  don't think we'll ever be as close as mother and son usually are but that's fine. I simply don't want to be angry anymore but the wounds are far from being healed. I need time to get over my pain. 

I want to forgive her and leave the past behind but at the same time I want punish her. She ruined over 15 years of my life. 15 years that I'm never getting back. I've been trying to avoid taking either option by distancing myself from her. I moved to a different city 9 months ago and we've had 2 or 3 phone calls during that whole time. 
I really feel bad for her. After everything she's gone through now she has to deal with her first son distancing himself emotionally from her. 
Life is odd and complicated. Sometimes the situations you find yourself in have no "correct" option at all. Sometimes you have to choose between two evils and both cause harm.¨
My answer to your question is simple and morbid. You'll survive with the least amount emotional pain if you give her a few chances of getting help and then just quitting on her. If she refuses to get help and keeps antagonising your family, there's no reason for you to suffer too, right? I know it'll be hard, but in the end it's for the best.
I hope your situation doesn't come to that.
Depression is something that takes time and love to get through. Pushing your mom away might only be a temporary fix for you, family and loved ones are really the only things that make life worthwhile. 

I myself suffered severely from depression and it only got worse, I gained almost 80lbs in just three short years. I was angry all the time, and very unpleasant I mean probably not as bad as what you described your mother to be. But eventually I got over things, decided to be happy and now I'm happier than ever. I've lost 102lbs as of today, my wife and I are as happy as we've ever been. Believe me life is still hard for us, we work hard every day but life is good now. And I have a great family that stuck by me, encouraged me and helped me along the way. 

What I'm saying is give your mother an honest chance, if it's going to be the last chance then go big or go home. Have a sit down with the whole family and try to get her some help. At the end of the day family is what matters and as much as it hurts they're always worth fighting for, atleast one more time. 
I felt that way at many points in my young life... but she divorced my dad and moved with her boyfriend. The distance is great. because now I don't have to listen to arguments everyday. Her drinking habits were terrible... I'm glad they got divorced. I love her and miss her. Just not what she put us through.
My mom is basically the same as yours. Unfortunately the situation already came to what you described. I just can't and don't want to give up on the good memories because, despite her controlling habits, she never meant any harm and I believe she really loves her sons. She just can't face her illness.
It's 5 years we're in this situation, I think. We've had a sit-down, but she brushed us off by saying that we were accusing her of things she didn't do and started playing victim. I'm honestly left with no "weapons" at this point. I think she needs to come to that realization on her own.
Some people are very afraid to face the fact that they have mental health issues. It's quite common and natural. When I got my own diagnosis I welcomed it because I had already long suspected something was off. But that might be the reason why some people like our mothers have trouble with admitting it. They think they're healthy so it's quite the shock to suddenly hear they're mentally ill..
I can't offer much professional advice but there are two things I'd like to bring up first. 

First, a person will only get better if they want to, you can't force them into it or trick them into it.

Secondly think about the words you yourself used, you are left with no "weapons" maybe you are attacking her and you just don't know it. Think about things from her perspective.

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. Have you thought about going out of your way and doing something really nice for her? Maybe plan a date just the two of you, either things she likes or things you used to do together. I'm not sure where you live, but Mother's Day is around the corner in North America. If you're not from here celebrate it anyways and surprise her, "It's Mother's Day in the states so I thought we'd celebrate anyways". 

I know it's asking a lot but maybe it's worth a shot. 

I really believe that people don't change because they are forced to, in order for somebody to change they need to see something that makes their life valuable enough to start making the necessary changes to make their lives worth living. 
My mom told me that when i wear t-shirts and jeans I don't look feminie and i need to wear makeup. I'm a teenage girl and most of the time i wear girly tops and makeup because I am girly. But do you think it was wrong of her to tell me that? 
I can't say whether it was wrong of her to tell you that but I feel it was pretty rude.  I mean, would you tell your Mom that running around the house in her bathrobe makes her look like an old, sagging lunatic?  Nope!

Personally I feel femininity has less to do with makeup and frilly clothes than it does how you feel about yourself.  If you feel feminine then you are feminine and no amount of jeans or t-shirts or bare skin will ever change that.
My momma told me blue jeans was the devil :/
Dress how you are comfortable. Jeans and a tee shirt is fine. You don't need make up.
So this will be a long post, I can feel it. I'm 17 about to be 18 in a few days and up until, I'm gonna say November of last year I lived with my Biological mother. It wasn't a good childhood if my mother could buy pill to abuse she would. Along with the fact she was Bipolar and would never take the amount of medicine she was suppose my life was terrible. It was like we'd have good days sitting down watching movies, normal family things. Then the next day she'd be screaming for something that happened while I was at school, something that I couldn't have done. 

Then she had a break down when I was 16, she thought that people were trying to kill us and dragged me across three states and would pull me from school. I eventually psyched myself up enough and called CPS and I got removed. I know live with my dad and my step-mom. I've never had a good home life. I never had birthdays, went to the theaters 5 time since I was 6, never allowed to go anywhere, had to teach myself how to take care of my hygiene etc. I had to lie to do a lot of stuff that normal kids just had to ask to do. So, lying became a part of my natural life, I was never caught cause she never cared. If I lied I got away with it but if I told the truth I got in more trouble then I thought it was worth.

 Life was good there for the last bit of 2016, cause I'm living with my step-mom and Dad. Then I told a few lies stuff that I had been doing for so, long that it was normal to do my step-mom got mad at me. Then the day before yesterday I turned of the air conditioning, cause this house stays at 65 and I like heat. When she came home, and got mad, she asked me about it I didn't think and said that it had been like that since I came home from school. When she realized I was lying she got mad and wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the night. And Today I told another lie and she got pissed at me. As she was yelling at me in the car on my way to school, she said that if I didn't get my act straight before I turned 18 she would kick me out cause that is her house (She bought before her and my dad were together) and she won't put up with my shit just cause I'm her husband's kid. 

I mean if she does it's not like I don't have anywhere to go I talked to my friends about it and they offered their homes if she ever did but I just always thought that maybe this would be the time. It feels that I just can't do anything without making it worst. If anyone has advice or heck, anything, I'd take it.

TL: DR: My actual mother was horrible thought that step-mom and dad would be better, but I lied a few times. Now, step-mom's threatening to kick me out in a few days when I turn 18.
You shouldn't lie, but your step mother is over reacting. Inwould sit down with her and your dad and have a talk.  Tell them you learned to lie to adapt to living with your nom and that it is a hard habit to break. Tell them that you will work on it (and actually out in an effort to do so). Explain that the fear of getting kicked out makes it harder to tell the truth since small things seem to cause big problems. Nake sure your dad hears this so he knows his wife is threatening to kick you out. Try to work with them to find a solution. 
I tried that before she talked to me about her situation (she went through some stuff to when she was younger) and said that I' just coming up with excuse about it. And that seeing as how I'm not living there anymore I should stop but when I try to explain how hard it is to stop she just blows it off as another excuse. Haven't tried talking to my dad about it though so I'll try that.
Does your dad know she is threatening to kick you out? He needs to step up here. Were abused and it takes time. 
She's probably mentioned it to him cause they talk about everything but he hasn't said anything about it I'll talk to him Sunday (he works nightshift so he sleeps most of the day).
Hello. I'm a 24 year old male and a recent college graduate. For the past 4 years or so, my mother's (64) health has dramatically decreased (broken hip, broken arm, broken knee that still hasn't healed after a year, EXTREME arthritis, and almost total blindness due to unknown causes).

She was in a nursing facility after breaking her knee, and, after announcing that she would stay permanently and telling me to get her house cleared out, abruptly decided to move back home into what had become a large, unclean storage unit.

Her closest relatives are me, my aunt, and my uncle, with the latter two wanting little to do with her. Therefore, it has become my responsibility to care for her and get whatever she needs. I DON'T live with her, as she is a 2-pack-a-day smoker and I physically cannot bear being around her for long periods of time. I live with my father and stepmother about 15 miles away.

 My mother is also a very demanding person, and will call at random times with huge grocery lists (most of which she does not eat) and request items that she cannot afford, often leading to me picking up the financial slack at the end of the month. In recent years she has also become very immature, throwing mini-tantrums and throwing guilt on me when I am simply unable to perform a task.

These responsibilities have effectively trapped me in my hometown, a small town with little opportunity. Right now, I can't even create a study schedule for my GMAT coming up in July, which I need to do well on for graduate school. Not only this, I cannot leave my hometown for better career opportunities. The doctors' appointments (pointless ones) have started to take up any and all free days that I have off from work (Full-time)

I'm getting to the point where I cannot deal with it anymore. It's actually hard for me to explain in words how bad of health she really is in and other family members often dismiss it and simply praise my devotion. She won't let me have power of attorney or even consider a nursing facility.

What do I do? I'm torn between the guilt of not doing right by my mother and the consequences of not doing right by myself and my future. I'm angry, frustrated, and depressed these days, because it's looking like I'll be stuck here working a minimum wage job and barely scraping by for God knows how long. I can't get ahead on my debt, can't make schedules or budgets, and can't seek other opportunities.


TL;DR I want a better situation and life for myself, but it is absolutely impossible while I have the responsibility of my mother. Just need advice.

I am so sorry you are in this position. Social services may be able to help you. Get a social worker involved and make it clear that you are not capable oc caring for her. They can offer support. They may try to get you to take on most of the responsibility, but make it clear you can't do that. 

You then need to have a conversation with your mother. If she insists on staying at home then she needs to hire a nurse or home care worker. She has to pay for it. If you go to the market, don't buy anything she won't eat or can't afford. You cannot take care of her full time. You aren't qualified and she seems to refuse to help herself.
I wonder if its worth talking to your uncle and aunt about whether they can help take some of the responsibility here. Maybe a roster system would help.

I second the suggestion of social services too. 

It might also be worth checking out if there are any young carer networks around you - somewhere to get some support.
I am seventeen years old, and have an 18 year old brother who is a senior in high school. We used to be close growing up, but we slowly drifted apart until this year, there was literally nothing left anymore. I see him everyday, to take me to and from school, but we have absolutely nothing to talk about. I feel like my stepbrother replaced me, and nothing makes me feel more shitty and depressed than when I think about how uneeded I am. I always ask myself why he doesn't like me, and why he rejects me in every way, but I have no idea honestly. I have always been nice to him, but he wants nothing to do with my life. I don't ask for much at all, just for him to care that I exist. He is a very unemotional person, which is totally fine, I just wish that I felt like I meant anything. He knows all the stuff I have been through with depression/knows that I self harm, and he completely ignores it. I don't really want to let go of our relationship, but I really fear that I have to. He is my brother and I love him to death, but I don't know what to do with someone who doesn't love or care about me. My brother is a very well-liked person, and I don't ever come across as nearly as cool as him, and it hurts so bad to feel inferior to him my entire life. I feel like the worst person alive because he doesn't like me. 
Hi OP -

I got a chance to read your post and felt compelled to reach out to you. You're at a fragile age, and surprisingly, so is your brother. 17 and 18 are pivotal times in boys and girls' lives and so culturally, emotionally, financially, even hormonally - we are sensitive to a lot more than normal. I am 28 now and have 2 sisters. Both of which I though didn't care an ounce for me when I was your age as well. It really messed with me that they never reached out when I was also going through things at your age. Now, 10 years later, they happen to be 2 of the people I can rely most on. You have to remind yourself that your brother too is going through his own form of self identity. He's growing up as well, and it may take him years before he realizes the value of having a wonderful sister like yourself. It may take an event in his life, or struggle he's dealing with, to see that you're there for him. Hopefully when that happens, he'll realize how important you are to him. You've barely scratched the surface on life...you'll be surprised at how close brothers and sisters get after 25 or so. Until then, know I care you exist and that if you ever need someone to talk to - you can message me on Reddit. I'm happy to give you my email as well, in case you need a person to talk to during your down times. You're not inferior. You're you. And if not today, one day that'll be exactly who someone needs
I agree with /u/excelsior23. My sister and I were not close until our mid 20's. She is 2 years and 5 days older than me
 We are now adults ans living our own lives. We are very different people, but we are still close. Give it time.
i really appreciate this response. it really means the world to me. thank you so much
I just found out that my grandfather abused people in my family and all of us only just found out when someone told me about it and my grandmother knew that it happened to one of her daughters and she said she didn't believe it or she didn't want to as she hates talking about the past, her life has always been in the house, no friends, no socialising, looking after him all her life. We told her over the years it's no life, but she says it's what she wanted. She met him when she was 15, he was in his 20's they married after 2 months of being together and have been with each other for 50 years so she doesn't know anything else. In all those years I don't think I've seen her be affectionate to him as he has been to her. Her family never talked to her but they never told us why and it's because of what they found out, apparently he got caught and for raping his 13 year old daughter he got 4 weeks in jail and my grandmother said to her daughter "it's the past he's been punished" that to me isn't being punished. My aunt actually forgave him and none of us knew (she's the oldest) we never would have guessed that because she has a relationship with them. it creeps me out thinking back, I'm mad at my grandmother as she kept this a secret for 36 years and she kept it a secret until I found out and she stayed with him, she basically just brushed it under the carpet, I think he's emotionally abused her with comments I've heard him say and everyone but they all said over the years like he'd call her "fat" and "who would have you if I didn't marry you" but everyone thought that was his humour which isn't right but they'd say "that's just him" and I told her today to leave him and her reply "where would I go"  only now she believes my sister  because she knows she wouldn't lie (it happened when she was 11-13) my sister is 18 I'm 22 and I blame myself for not knowing I honestly hate myself right now. I'm completely disgusted but I'm trying to help my family and I'm completely finished with him now this is really hard for me and everyone and I have no idea what to do. Nothing happened to me that I know of because I don't remember my childhood but I don't think nothing happened. Our family is broken and we have to come together because we don't know who else this has happened to. I know my family went through hell. is it mean of me to think why didn't she tell us? As we have really young kids in our family and they were at risk I just don't know what to think but I haven't said this to her as she blames herself enough and I'm supporting her she hadn't had an easy life and he always put her down when he's the reason why she's like this sorry I'm going on I'm just still processing this it doesn't feel real I just want to be there for them.
I am so sorry you are going through this.
Thanks.
I am the eldest and the bread winner. I also hand the budget to my mom. The budget is supposedly for 2weeks. Most of the time, after just 1 week the budget is already consumed and there's nothing left. I feel bad about it. I think she is mismanaging the budget. Later I would discover that she did not pay other bills last month so she took it from the budget this month. By the way, my younger sister provides money for the bills, so the money I give my mom is for food alone (that is my expectation).  I usually don't give my father money because I'm afraid he would just buy alcohol (he has great tendency to do that). Could you advice me on how should I manage the budget. I suggested that I would just give my mom the weekly budget but she don't want that set up. Sigh

Stop letting your mother handle the money. The people earning the money are the ones who decide how things get paid and on what schedule. 

With a budget, you figure out what needs to be paid and you prioritize. Rent/mortgage are always first, followed by food and water, followed by electricity and everything else. If your household doesn't make enough, see where you can get help or cut corners. 
You should not be in this position. I am so sorry you are dealing with this. Budgetd are hard. If you think she is not handling right then you need to either give her money for onlt one week at a time or do the shopping yourself. You shouldn't have to do this, but it may be the only way.
I am proposing that I will give her and my father equal amounts so that it will be fair for both of them. And that way, I won't care how they do the spending. I just want to do my responsibility of giving back since I'm the one who is earning.
Thanks. I am in this reaponsibility since I started working. I have nothing against that, but I just want things to be properly handled. I wanted to be fair to my parents and I want to give them equal benefits. 
Hello, everyone. I'm currently in my junior year of college, and I'm 20 years old. I'm going to be 21 in a couple of weeks, but I've  thought about my relationship with my dad recently. 

My relationship with my father has always been difficult, and I'm not close with him. We don't have much in common, and we have completely different interests. Whenever I'm at home, I don't spend much time with him, and I feel like I can't bond with him that well. 

Plus, he has a problem with me crying. Whenever I cry, he always gets upset with me for doing so. He used to yell at me for crying, and he told me that crying is a sign of weakness. I can't really cry in front of him because of that, and he doesn't want to see me cry. 

My dad also gets aggressive with me. He yells at me or gets angry with me whenever I mess up or do something wrong, and I've noticed that he's not that patient or calm with me. I don't respond well to yelling & anger, but he doesn't seem to recognize that. 

My dad also did some things to my mom that were very disrespectful, and I've considered limiting contact with him. I don't want to deal with his aggressive side anymore, and I don't like how he gets upset with me for crying. I feel like I should be closer with my father, and that I'm being immature or whiny by feeling like this. My dad has shown support to me at times, but he's done things that I can't ignore for any longer. 

So, am I in the wrong for feeling like this? 

You aren't wrong for feeling this way. Juat because someone is family doesn't make then a good person. If your father can't be supportive then limiting contact seems like a good course of action.
if you dont care much about the details, feel free to skip to the 3rd paragraph.

first off, i was hanging out with my girlfriend (i never told my mom she was my gf, but i think she has a pretty good idea she is) and i told my mom i was just going to the parkwith her but then we had to take her sisters and brother home. so i texted my mom i was at her house when i got there and then she came and picked me up and yelled at me for not telling her where i was going there and also that i was there without her parents being home (her grandpa was there though) my mom is also friends with one of my gfs neighbors. they were texting each other and the neighbor said some fucked up shit about my gf. My mom showed me the text and said i can never hang out with her again. mom told me to not tell my gf about it, she wanted me to lie to her about why i can never hang out with her again.

the next day me and my girl were talking over the phone and i told her the real reason i cant hang out with her. i told her not to tell anyone, but she went and told her family. they talked to their neighbors about the situation. the neighbors then told my mom

my mom is camping, so she called me saying shes taking everything away from me, my phone, computer, and my social life. i wont be able to talk to anyone. ill have no friends to talk to. shes gonna home school me and i have to go with her and my dad EVERYWHERE they go.  i can have no social media because i have no internet connecting devices anymore.
im already shy enough as it is, how will taking everyone i know help me at all in life? i dont have any of my friends phone numbers so i cant call them with our home phone. i also live miles away from any friends so i cant just walk to their houses to talk or whatever.

my dad was home so my mom called him and he asked me to give him my stuff. i really like him though because he wasnt yelling at me or telling me off or anything, he just said that mom told him to take all of my devices away.

i really dont want to do this, especially because i love my parents so much (my moms way overprotective and strict, but my dad is chill with pretty much anything. ill still love them no matter what) but i was kind of considering running away or even just ending my life if it gets bad enough.

this was mostly to vent out my feelings, but if anyone could help me in this situation, that would be very appreciated.

p.s. if anyone was wondering how i am writing this, my dad forgot about my laptop. But my mom gets home tomorrow and starting tomorrow i wont be home alone anymore so i cant use my laptop anymore.
Looks like you got grounded. I wouldn't worry too much about it if she's not seriously abusing you physically or verbally. It sounds to me that she's simply way overprotective. You may end up thanking her later for that. It's much easier to turn a negative into a positive rather than dwell on the negative.

Take full advantage of not having your devices and take up a personal hobby, maybe something constructive that you find truly enjoyable and that you might be able to translate into a valuable skill later. Read books.

Now, I didn't do any of these things when I was young and going through issues with my parents like you are. I was a total fuckup, but I improved. However, learning from my own mistakes is worthless if I don't try and pass it on to younger ages.

Also take an opportunity to sit down with your parents and thank them for everything they do, positive or negative from your perspective. Sometimes, showing signs of maturity like these will result in a higher level of trust from your parents.


Hope this helps. Best wishes!



I don't know what advice to give you, but that fucking sucks your mom sounds terrible (and a lot like mine). I can't really help you but I'm hoping it all works itself out.
Your mom put you in an unfair position. I she shouldn't have told you all that stuff and expect you to keep it secret. I have no idea what is true and what isn't. If you mom feels you are sneaking around it is understandable she would put you on lock down. It does seem extreme, but I don't have all thr information.
Your mom sucks bruv, how old are you? Sounds like your 14 or something. Want some life advice from a 20 year old m pm me.
This level of isolation sounds awful.  I'm sorry this is the type of mom you have.  I'm sorry your dad isn't stepping up to protect you from what seems to be a terribly manipulative and controlling relationship with your mother.  

I hope your mom doesn't keep true to her promises.  If she does, hang in there until you turn 18 and then run far, far away.  You may look at your dad as the good guy now.  When you look back at your childhood, you'll see him as her enabler instead of your protector.  
I don't know how to cope with being around my family anymore. I have moved out of home and visit once or twice a fortnight. Yet every time we are together the tension between everyone else is so thick and it is so extremely hard to diffuse.

A bit of background... My father passed away two years ago very suddenly. He was such a rock in our family and since he died the relationship between the rest of us (Mother, three sisters (16, 21, 23) has deteriorated. It wasn't great before he went, but it was better. 

I am the middle child and have a good relationship with the members of my family. I have quite a mellow peronality and am level headed so it's not difficult for me to maintin these relationships. Although I do struggle with my older sister at times who suffers from BPD. 

However, my younger sister won't speak to my older sister and every time she does it's laced with acid. She actively avoids interacting with her. My mother and younger sister are very close and very similar however my mother and my older sister take offence to every little thing said by the other. It's so ridiculous that it gets to the point where no one can even speak without it being interpreted as negative, even if I can see it wasn't meant in that way. 

The tension when we hang out together is unbearable. However my older sister insists that we have a family dinner every week. I find myself exhausted after every time as I try to act overly cheerful to diffuse the hostility that gets thrown around. I just don't know how to make the situation better anymore... I don't know if anyone else has had a similar experience and have been able to do something to make it better. If so, I would love to hear. 
You have to realize it isn't your responsibility to make them get along. If you put yourself in the middle you will constantly be miserable because it is an impossible task. You can't control their behavior. You can only control how you react. It is tough to get used to, but I promise you will be happier for it.
What do you do when you are related to pure evil? I mean Cinderella's family doesn't have shit on my sister-in-law. They look like cuddly puppies. This individual has isolated my brother from us in a way where we still see and speak to him but he is basically brain washed. She is extremely shellfish. Like she is the only that exists on the planet kind of shellfish. They kind of person that puts getting her nails done above all else. She is awful and I try to continue to grit and bear it but Jesus in 5 years she is really testing me. She has been sole reason in my family for discord. Of course it didn't start this way. Me being the dum ass I am and was so trusting of everyone, I always give everyone the benefit of the doubt. We started as friends when my brother first brought her home. About a year and a half in my dad was sick and she was removed from being the center of my brother's universe. Instead of being encouraging and helpful she decided to take it out on our family and brain washed my brother. I had to move to another part of the state to take care of my father at facility that was able to care for him after a few  scary moments. Luckily it was near cousin's so I lived with them. At that point she stopped contact with me and was insistent on the fact that I had stopped with her. While I was there I hadn't initially noticed the lack of communication because I was involved with my father's care. Then it came to discussion of family visits. She argued with my brother her point was that he couldn't come visit my sickly father and I on a particular weekend because she had to work and would. It be able to go with him.  This was the start of the real friction. He didn't come. Then her 85+ year old grandmother who was the absolute most sweetest person passed away of cancer she had been battling for a long time. I didn't go home for the funeral because I needed to stay with my dad as my mother came as often as she could but needed to maintain our family business and household back in our home town. I called, texted, and sent flowers. I was the sole available caregiver for my father. Then three weeks later my dad wasn't doing well. He downspirled quickly and I watched them code my father and he died in front of me. My Aunt and uncle and cousins were there but I was essentially alone from my brothers and mother. I had to pick up the phone. I had to call them. To tell them. In the weeks after I clammed up I didn't talk much and kept to myself after I returned home to mom and brothers. It was two weeks after my father's death that my brother had screamed at me within an inch of my face  for mistreating his beloved girlfriend. I had done so by not talking to her. I wasn't talking to anyone. She took personal offense to this. Apparently, according to her , " I wasn't grieving properly​". I told her to go fuck herself.I was from then on deemed the BITCH sister-in-law  and it has gone on ever since. No matter how I have attempted to repair things. I am the unmentionable. The low class not good enough for her in law. And my brother....He stands by her. He has turned has back on his family including my mother on numerous occasions. The got engaged 8 months after we laid my father to rest. I begged him not to marry her as the turmoil continued and she went out of her way to ruin birthday after birthday and family gatherings every time she felt she wasn't the center of the world. I went out of my way to make peace in several occasions, I did things for her and her family that risked my job, sanity, and self worth, and still she continues to make it all about her.My mother is in agony about the state of our family with my father gone. I LOVE my brother. If I didn't talk to him for 30 years and got a phone call saying I was a match for a kidney I would be on my was in an instant. But I am done now. We are putting plans in place to move away and be free from this. It will take a few years but it's happening. My mother is coming with us. My younger brother may follow as well. I am sad and relieved all in the same.
I am so sorry. It is tough because you can't make him see it. Abusers are good at isolating their victims and it sounds like she has mastered that. Don't light yourself on fire to keep others warm. 
Thank you. It's so hard. My parents raised us to be close to one another. Its hard and I miss him. 
I grew up the oldest of four girls, and if there is one thing having three younger sisters taught me, it's that siblings are the only people you'll ever have a relationship with, where you can beat them to a bloody pulp and they'll still love you. Well at least after they get even with you. My sister and I have beat each other up multiple times, ruined each other's self esteem during fights (no joke) we've done things we're not proud of and we are still very close and loving. Here's one example. 

One night my sister below me (three years younger) and I were fighting in the car, I don't remember what it was about, but at some point she called me Hitler, if  it remember why but she did, so I'm response I called her a Jew. It's pretty awful, but that fight didn't have any effect on us. We moved on pretty quickly and laugh about it now. Because we sounded so stupid. 

That's the nature of sibling relationships, you can say the meanest things to each other and in a few hours to a few days, it won't matter anymore. Then it turns into fun sibling memories you tell at the dinner table during holidays. ❤️ love your brother(s) or/sister(s), they may hate you at times, and you may hate them, but at the same time, they're the only ones who will probably help you hide a dead body (just kidding) they're the only ones who will be there for you, regardless of the past. 
she's constantly angry, moaning, shouting and just makes people feel bad. just had my bath and she was moaning about me having spots, my weight and comparing me with a girl near to us (my age)- saying things like 'despite her father being dead she's still healthy and doing good in school.' she's always shouting at my father saying 'oh i've been working all day but as soon as you come back from getting (my brother's name) you instantly sot down and do nothing.' and when my father asks what he can do, she tells him to forget it, does the task herself, then again moans at him for doing nothing- despite her telling him not to.

she always moans at him, and whenever she causes a problem (mainly with various of my brothers having drinking/money/drug related problems) takes it out on my father or finds away to make me feel bad.

sick of tired of her. is it a bad thing as soon as i'm 18 i want to get out of this house asap? currently 15 (going 16 in may) and despite me going to enjoy college, i feel like crap constantly. she made comments about my weight- which she's done for  while, calling me fat, saying that  will never be in a relationship, that i look ugly with my spots, so on. i'm going to start eating less, but i cant do exersize so i dont know how much less.
i've just never felt like i've ever done good, always negativity.


i also feel like i can share nothing with her or she'll moan. she already calls me childish for still watching cartoons, despite me trying to watch a more teen related show and her saying 'you cant watch this- to adult' and switching it off, despite it being for 13+, i cant do anything right.
cant share with her my feeling, issues i have so on, doesn't help theres no counsellor in school now.
is it legal for me to leave home at 16, despite me having nowhere to go?

any advice at all? sorry for it being long i just dont know...
You should check out r/raisedbynarcissists
I'm sorry. Some people aren't happy unless they are miserable. I call them emotional vampires. She thrives off the reaction you give her. Ignore her. I know it is hard, but try not to react. It will drive her nuts and give you some peace.

thanks for offering me this

thanks you, i will try to do as i'm sick of her. thanks for your comment
sorry to hear that, and that is a long time. i want to keep contact with my mother, but i dont know if it will benefit me or not. thank you :)
First of all, we're about as poor as poor gets (like we get tax refund checks because our income is so low and last year we had to sleep in our car for a period of time) but everyone in my family has compulsive spending problems so this is the kind of stuff that just happens with us. 

My father has bad credit so we use go phone plans (who would've guessed compulsive spending problems could land you with bad credit?). Every six or so months my little sister gets annoyed with whatever phone she has and makes my dad buy her another $300 phone. (I'm not even kidding, she's had around 14 or 15 phones). My older sister is away at college and she has a Verizon plan with her own credit. I have a job and I was planning on going my sister's plan so we could start a family plan because it would be cheaper for both of us (each of us would pay $40 a month where we she pays $80 now and I pay $50). I was gonna pay for the down payment and the actual phone with my own money because I don't think it's right to make my dad buy me a new phone whenever I feel like it. 

When my sister started looking into adding a line, Verizon sent us something in the mail offering her a new line and this just about set everything off. Immediately my father and my little sister start shopping for her new phone (for as long as I can remember she's been condemning iphones and people who are "dumb enough to buy into iphone culture" but now all of a sudden she wants a new iphone). My older sister said she refused to add my little sister to her line because she's had too many new phones and because we had already agreed that I was going on her line. (Btw, my sister has to take out student loans in my dad's name, which my dad thinks are his to spend on whatever. So every semester they send her $3000 in loans which my dad uses to buy phones for my little sister.)

Now my father is looking into getting an at&t plan with his bad credit, where if they approve him at all, he'll pay a $250 deposit at the least plus the $100 he owes them from the past and the $100 a month for the actual plan (currently she pays $50 a month). It's not her birthday or Christmas but out of nowhere she's shaking him down for $350 plus another $50 a month. It doesn't even matter if he isn't approved because he'll just buy a prepaid iphone for $300. Then next year he'll buy another one and another one.

I've already expressed to them how stupid this all is but anytime you try to tell my little sister she can't buy something she throws a fit (an actual toddler fit). She claims that everyone is harassing when we try to explain to her that we're living below the poverty line and dropping $300 on a phone for her, while her current phone works perfectly fine, isn't something we should be doing. 

Growing up poor has made me very sensitive with money (where somehow it's made my little sister careless with it), so watching my dad spend money he shouldn't be spending really bothers me. It's one thing for my dad to spend money like it's nothing, but the fact that my little sister constantly shakes him down is another thing. When I move out I know for a fact it's gonna get so much worse. Every dollar he has is gonna go into buying her new clothes and new laptops whenever she feels like it. It seems like no matter what I say my dad is gonna buy my sister whatever she wants, it doesn't matter if we have to sleep in the car again. Do I let them just waste money or do I step out of it because it's hopeless? 
MOVE OUT!
Your sister is making your dad do anything. He choosee too. It os just bad decisions. He is a grown man. He is.free to say no.
Step out. And dont give money to your dad or sister if you have extra. If your parent need financial help see to it that if ever you give money it will be spent on needs and not wants.

It is very hard to earn money to waste it to just wants specially if just trying to make both ends meet.

Seems your sister and dad are in denial of your family's financial needs. Bcoz they spend more on wants than needs.

Just my opinion. 
I am moving out when I go to college but that isn't the point. I hate seeing my little sister waste my dad's money and I know it's gonna be worse when I move. I want my parents to be happy and I don't want her to drain them but she doesn't understand anything.
I know but if my sister wasn't pushing him to buy a phone we don't need and can't afford then he wouldn't be doing it. I understand what you're saying though. It just makes me angry that he won't say no.
It sounds absolutely frustrating. It is hard to be a parent and some never learn how to say no.
Dear peanut,

It's been awhile since I've written to you, don't think I have forgotten. The truth is, I wasn't sure how to talk to you without blaming you or myself. And if these three years have taught me anything is that it's not your fault nor is it mine that you aren't here today. I never got a chance to hold you in my arms and tell you good night stories. I never gave you the chance to let me hear your heartbeat.

I want to tell you a story.

When I found out I was pregnant with you, I was terrified and aesthetic. It was my first pregnancy and I had already fallen in love with you. I couldn't wait to tell your father, little did I know he wasn't going to feel the same way that I did. But the first thing he said was "no". He made decisions for us to have you taken from me. He mansplained his way through doctors appointments and asked me to hurry up through the pills I didn't realise were killing you. When I woke from my daze, it was too late. My mother rushed me to the ER. I was poked and prodded by nurses and doctors who called me a monster under their breath. When they finally got to you it was too late. They put you on the blue cloth and said to me "this is what you've done." Your father was nowhere to be seen. 

I stayed a week in the hospital, due to complications, yet your father never came to see me. The only company I had was the Indian lady who brought me breakfast. I woke up in the middle of one night, profusely bleeding, and when I asked for help from one of the nurses she ripped my gown off and strapped to me into a maternity diaper. I was suicidal and I was depressed. I'll wake up in the middle of the night crying before being shushed by the patient next to me. The psychiatrist asked me why I didn't want you. I wasn't sure how to answer them because it was never my decision in the first place. My mother picked me up and on the same day asked if I was going back to university on Monday. She only visited once. 

I picked up the phone to call your father but he refused to see me. I cried and I begged for him to love me despite everything that he didn't do. I was alone. I was scared, and I didn't want to be any more. So I made the decision to live my life a few more weeks and then I will be united with you in heaven. I was ready to say goodbye. 

But remember my darling, blessings can happen in the darkest of times. 

A month a half later, a pair of grey eyes met mine in a busy Uni foyer. We didn't say much but, to me, it was enough. Of course I was weary, and of course I didn't let him in. How could I? I was not about to let another man loom over me. 

But oh my darling, love can grow in the most broken of broken. If you let it. 

In time, I learned to forgive myself. I learned to forgive your father too. Hate wouldn't have brought you back to me, nor would it help me love again. I learned to stop blaming myself and I learned to stand on my own feet. It took awhile, but Mr grey eyes was patient with me, he loved me through my scars. 4 years on and we're still together, stronger than ever. Twice we thought I was pregnant, twice I thought you you've come back to forgive me. Then I could've shown you what a wonderful man I have met. But our time will come when we're ready and I know this time it would be different. 

My love when you come back to this earth, as ours or not, please remember the lesson I learned. 

To my peanut and future babies, I urge you to know your worth, unbelievable strength and courage. I wish I knew mine back then, I do now. Please know that you are beautiful and know that you're always loved. Never let anyone tell you what to do with your body, come to us if you're ever in trouble. We'll fight for you, move mountains and even part seas for you. We've got you. Pinky promise. 

We love you already, 
who ever and where ever you are. 

Ever thine
Ever mine 
Ever Ours
- Beethoven 

I am so sorry for your loss and how you were treated. Thank you for sharing this. Losing a child is a pain that runs so deep and hurts in a way that makws it hard to go on. I have been there. You are a survivor. Never forget that.
I'd like to know if anyone has been left anything after a family-member's passing in the form of a letter/treasure-map/quest?

Did they leave you an unexpected letter with some new information?
Maybe they left you a map with somewhere to visit?
Perhaps a gift in their will - something you never knew existed?


Uh, no. 
So my parents have been married for 34 years, I guess about 10 years ago my Dad had an affair and I was recently introduced to my 10 year old Half sister. 

Now, My Mom is upset BUT she LOVES my Dad. She kinda just wants to ignore the fact that anything happened...BUT now my Dad wants to move my half sister into he and my Mom's house with them, Of course my Mom is against this. The issue is my Dad is the type of guy that will push the envelope and just bring my sister home with him one day. 

Now I don't have any hate for my half sister and its not her fault. I think my dad is kinda an asshole for what he did, but I also think its huge of him for atleast being man enough to stick in this kids life and not run. 

What Im asking is, Is it OK for me to stick up for my Mom (especially with the moving this kid into their home) even though I no longer live there? Or am I wrong in this situation and should I stay out of it? BTW, Im team Mom on this one. 

FRAT: Dad knocked up some broad, wants to move my half sister into he and my moms house. Can I stick up for my Mom or would I be an asshole for that?
That sounds like a sucky situation :( 

But also immediately made me think of Ned Stark and Jon Snow. :p

I think you should talk to your dad and maybe try to help him see where your mom is coming from, but also, IANAE. 
Your dad screwed up big time. It is easier to forgive when you are not facing a living, breathing embodyment of your husband infidelity. It is great yoir dad wants to be there fir this kid, and he should be. But if your mom doesn't want her in the home it is going to end badly.
yeah guys, shitty situation. Thanks for the advice
Stick with your mom, even if t doesn't accomplish anything just having your support will make her feel better.
I don't have any experience in this kind of situation, but I personally think you should stick up for your mom. Just do your best to be polite, but don't worry, I'm on your side no matter what.
So my brother recently asked my grandfather for money for me for a car payment.  I had been advised by our mother to ask my grandfather for the money, but I decided against it.  I'm not close with my grandfather and I would rather pay off the loan myself.  My cousins all regularly ask our grandfather for large sums of money and to co-sign on leases and loans for them.  My brother currently lives with my grandfather while going to university and my grandfather pays for his tuition.  My brother went behind my back and asked my grandfather for the money for me.  I didn't want this, but my grandfather gave me the money anyway.

When I confronted my brother about it, he said that he did it because he feels guilty when anyone asks my grandfather for money and if my brother is going to feel guilty, he was going to do so on his own terms.  He said I was too inept to handle my own money well and needed his help to get back on track financially.  He then proceeded to shame me for not doing any housework in preparation for our family's Passover Seder (I work 12 hour shifts this week and may not even be able to attend the Seder, even though I live at home).  After that, he went on a tirade about getting a speeding ticket (75 in a 55) because "the officer was a jerk." 
 
This is not the first time my brother has interceded in my relationships or overstepped his bounds.  Last year I was in my first serious relationship that ended partly due to my brother sending the guy a message with suggestions for engagement rings (we had talked ONCE about getting engaged) as well as tips for how to manage me at home, ie, beat me weekly and tell me I'm inept as opposed to stupid because I actually have brains if I bother to use them correctly.  (Yes I am serious.  That really went down.  I'm 25 and he's 5 years younger than me, by the way.)  The guy decided my family was too "intense" for him and dumped me as a result of my brother's message.

I talked to my father about it and he agreed my brother was out of line.  My mother, however, stood up for my brother and not only defended him but tried to justify his actions to me.  I told my mother I was not having any of it, and that made her angry.  The same thing happened last year; my mother took my brother's side and my father took my side.  

So, our Seder is tomorrow and I don't know what to do.  Mom has been out of town for three days and is expecting me to have cleaned the whole house (I worked two of those days and was out of town myself dealing with my brother and grandfather on the other, and she knows this, so I don't know how she expects me to have any work done.)  I have to work and won't be home in time for the Seder, the alone any prep.  Should I just go out and ignore the Seder, not wanting to deal with my psycho family?  Or just hole myself up in my room?  What do I do? 
I think you stand up and be your own person. Do what you can to help woth Seder. Don't focus on the money aspect. You are all enough to be your own person. Do you best to be thst person.
To set some background:
I'm 17

Sister is 15, as is boyfriend

Our Dad is out of the picture


So my sister started bringing her boyfriend over for sleepovers and all was fine at first. 

Then my mother and I begin to notice he has a controlling side to him, would want to know why what she's doing, why she's doing it, what's she wearing, where is she, who is she with, etc  when on the phone. 

Then came the arguments, he's practically living here now. He would literally scream at her for the slightest thing. I eventually told him that this was enough and he'd be leaving otherwise, he didn't realise it was controlling and they'd work it out. Teenage couple issues, or so I thought. 

After a few days he's back practically living here and the arguments begin again. And I hear they're on to the topic of me. He's saying how I control everything and from the sound of it threatens to hurt me fairly badly. 

I tell my mum (remember her from earlier?) about this and... No shits are given. I tell her and him that I'm not living here with her boyfriend as he's controlling and has threatened to hurt me.... No shits are given. 

I tell my mum that either he goes or I go. Well that was a week ago and here I am homeless at a friend's house. 

Where did I go wrong? What normal parent chooses anyone over family? 

Tldr: Mum picked sisters boyfriend over me, her son
This had happened to me. My sister's boyfriend was aggressive and cruel to me. I moves out with my thrn boyfriend  (now husband) and never looked back. It has been years and he is gone, but it still hurts to be choosen last. They basically told they knew Inwould be fine and he wouldn't. It felt like a betrayal. I wish you all the luck in thr world.
i think you're a bit weird about this, even if your sis' bf is a dick you seem a bit possessive or w/e
I am so exhausted mentally. 

I have been searching for my birth father for 15 years. I found someone I thought may be his wife last week on Facebook. After so many dead ends I didn't get exicted when I wrote her a quick short message asking if she knew my father Steve and gave a short list of stats I knew about him.

I got a response almost immediately saying yes she did know him and confirmed they are married.

I almost fell out of my chair because this is the closest I've ever been to finding him!

I explained who I was and that I would appreciate if she would pass along my contact information so he could contact me. I never told her why. 

However she loosely knew my family from years ago and realized who I was and why I was looking for her husband. She immediately responded telling me that her husband said to tell me that I am not his child and to go look for court records to prove a blood test was done to disprove the paternity. She ended her message with a rude "Good luck to you it could be any number of men hunny." 

Needless to say in my 15 years of searching I have never found any paternity test and my mother loved this man and not only was he her first- he was her final for the next 10 years until she remarried. She has told me that I should go to the courthouse and that way I'll know for sure- but she denied this new allegation. I can tell asking her broke her heart. 

The following day I confirmed no test was ever done with the courts as the new wife alleged. 

I was so angry. So so angry. I messaged the wife back and told her flat out she was either lying or had been lied to. I also told her that I should be speaking with my father not her and again asked her to pass along my contact info to my father. Let him decide what to do I told her.

She replied again with the same story. Only now she switched it to a different court house and said I would not be allowed to see the results. It's a lie. I get why she may be worried about me suddenly appearing in my father's life. I explained to her I had no intention of causing issues however I am his child. I ended my reply with a offer to pay for a new test at a place and time of their choosing. That way she would also have the truth. 

This made her extremely angry and she lashed out. 

She refuses to tell my father about this conversation.  She said she was "passing along information from him" but I don't believe her. She is the only way to find my father. My only other option is to look up her address and try to meet my father as he leaves the home. I have no idea what he looks like. And I'm worried she may become violent.

What should I do? People of reddit who found a birth parent only to be blocked by a new spouse- what did you do? Back off? Wait it out? I am in a sticky situation and this woman hates me and is extremely threatened by me. 

TIA 
Do you really want to get more involved with the toxiv situation? Your dad has made the choice to not be in your life for 15 years. If he wanted to contact you he could have. Maybe she is passing the messages along and mayne she isn't. You can't make this man be a part of your life. I know that sucks, but it is the truth. You have managed 15 years without him. I would continue to do so.
Excuse any formatting, I am on mobile.

I'm currently considering going supernova with half my family. Quick background - 28, Male, married with Kids, and one on the way!


Around October of 2016 my Wife started making plans for my Birthday. The idea was to have a friend that my family is fond of, and my family over for dinner. That didn't work out as our friend was out of Country for that day. My wife tried several different dates, and ultimately we had my family over for my birthday, and three weeks later had my friend, his girlfriend, and my brother and his girlfriend over for a game night. All was good.


About a month later we announced my wife was pregnant, in front of the family. My sister gave no congratulations, or acknowledgement. Some backstory, she had been trying to have kids for awhile.

Fast forward to Christmas, my Mother had a few drinks and told me how angry she was that her and my sister had been excluded from my Birthday, and how she spent x$ on dinner when they were over (for my Birthday), and how unfair it was to exclude them.


I went over how things worked out, and she gave me the runaround about my wife and her lying.


Since then my sister has not seen my kids, who she professes to everyone are her favourite things in the world for over 3 months. She also recently miscarried. 

I've now learned from multiple sources within the family that my sister is running around calling my wife a bitch, and talking about what a terrible person she is. My mother is completely on her side.

We have been excluded from multiple family events, up until now. We are invited for a "family" dinner on Easter. I'm torn between showing up, saying what I think and leaving, or cancelling and saying what I think.

My wife is very upset because the kids idolize my sister and grandma.

Two further details, apparently my mother and sister have been slighted by my wife, I know what was said and what happened. Neither of them have come forward to address the matter, they just say things behind our backs.

The second point, prior to this birthday event, everyone professed how they loved my wife, how she turned my life around. I have video of my sister crying giving a speech at my wedding about what a difference my wife has made.

And now this for the past 4 months. I'm done, and it's time to stand up for my wife.

Thoughts?
Your mom sounds like a drama queen. Your sister is in the wrong, but I also imagine she is having a really hard time if she was trying to get pregnant and then had a miscarriage. She needs to stop, but she may be grieving. It isn't a baf idea to cut them out for now. Your wife and kids don't need this. You don't need this. Standing up for your wife is important, but it sounds like you are already doing that. Some people love drama and your mom and sister fall into that category.
I commend you for sticking up for your wife. Trust me she will also appreciate it.
When it comes to family drama there is one simple rule to live by. If the problem is with the husbands family- it's the husbands responsibility. If the problem is with the wife's family - it's the wife's responsibly. 
Now you certainly don't want to get crazy and throw around blame, that will just further alienate your wife. But it's also important to resolve this asap so there isn't further anger cooked up.
I say avoid your mom. Go directly to your sister. That's the root of all this. Have her meet you and talk to her about how this is hurting your family. Ask her to resolve this for your sake. Be calm and don't name call. 
If you can get sister back on board then mom will have to follow suit. 
Good luck. It happens to us all.
Apologies in advance for how long this might be. I've been living in Illinois with my wife for a little over 10 years now. I'm from the UP area and my wife is from Louisiana. We have a 2 1/2 year old and needless to say, living here has been a beat down money-wise. I've been taking classes to improve my writing, with the main goal going into screenwriting or something in that realm. My wife has been insanely supportive through this, but on the other hand, my parents have been a little so-so.

Anyways, we've decided that we want to move to Louisiana, because not only are there opportunities in my field (it's crazy how much Louisiana has to offer movie-wise), the money we would save would be great and my wife can finally jump on her career, because about 90% of her family lives there and they're just as supportive and amazing as she is. The minute we told them this was our plan, they sent us a text showing us a babysitting list, how excited they are AND if we ever had to make travel plans, they'd always be there to help. 

Before I get into this, I have to note, I do have a good relationship with my parents and they do love my wife. But unfortunately, I have to now jump to a handful of negatives. My parents have always been supportive, to a certain degree. They understand my passion is in writing and I have shown strides in showing them this is what I want to do for the rest of my life, but every so often, I get the eye roll from my dad when I'm explaining my latest project and a "I'm just happy you have a full time"-esque comment. Then my mom is kind of the same way. If I'm talking to her about writing stuff, sometimes she'll say things like "and you're sure this isn't a hobby?" or "how about you guys move back here?" Sidenote: At one point, that was an option to move back, but my wife has had some terrible experiences there. (For a few years (middle school to highschool) her mom lived in the UP as well and just to name a few things, her mom was swindled out of their home, that same person tried to sue them, my wife's best friend constantly tried to break us up and would spread rumors and that's just spreading the surface. It was an unnecessary soap opera.). Anyways, I've had experiences before with my parents and telling them life changing moments (EX: Telling them I'm getting married, moving in with her, before we're married (parents are VERY traditional)) and it was usually met with disappointment. My parents live a life where they think they've done everything right, so if you're not following in the same footsteps they've taken, YOU'RE not doing it right. Needless to say, I have poor, if not terrible communication with my parents. It just seems like they can never be wrong.

Coming back to the moving situation. We know it's going to happen. We've talked about it for about a year now and now we've finally put our foot down. My wife's mom (who still lives in the UP) is very understanding of this. I mentioned once, about 4-5 months ago to my parents that Louisiana is on our radar. Mom's reaction: "Don't do that. It's too hot there." Dad: "I mean, you could save money, but Louisiana?" Ever since then I haven't brought it up to them. The reason why this is bothering me so much is because whenever I have these conversations with them, it wrecks me inside. I have no idea why, but it just does. They also try to throw in a few moments to make me feel guilty. EX: I told them we'd be moving somewhere other than the UP and my mom immediately said, "you can't keep taking my grandson away from me," even though we've given her dozens of opportunities to come visit and she's always had a new excuse. Quick note: I'll make this short, but in the beginning of my relationship with my wife, my mom and her did hate each other. My entire family loved her, except for my mom. But now, they do get along. Long story. At that time, it absolutely destroyed me and I'm scared this conversation will bring back up old wounds. 

Quick jump to my friends: About 95% of my friends still live in the UP, as does my best friend. He's also insanely supportive of what I do and I know it won't be as hard to talk to him about it, but every so often, he does bring up the fact that if we were to move even further away, we'd never see each other and that "bums him out." (he knows about the move to a certain extent. He just doesn't know it's final yet.) I can't lose him as a friend, because he's been there through pretty much everything with me. 

Is there a way to calm myself down about this situation? We've gone through all of the pros and cons and it keeps pointing to us moving to Louisiana, because that's A.) Fantastic for our careers and B.) We can finally start saving money. 

Note: I know I mentioned I was a writer, so I apologize this post is probably riddled with errors.
You need to do what is best for your family. If moving is what is best you should move. You don't owe anyone an explaimation. It is hard when you have kids, but as you said, it isn't like they are taking advantage of the fact you live close. You can't wait for their approval because it isn't likely to happen. They are going to find fault with whatever you plan because it isn't what they would do. They may guilt you. It isn't their choice. They don't get a vote.
You have to make the right decision for YOU, and your family (wife and kid). Don't expect them to take it well, but take their reaction with a grain of salt. One of the big hurdles is that as an adult, you no longer need or require your parent's approval with your life decisions. If this is the right thing for you, then assert yourself and let them know. Maintain a positive relationship with them if you can, and if you can't then maybe take a step back unless and until you are able to.
I don't  know what the words LOVE really mean or should i say, I don't know the definition of love, in my own mind, or if I should ask to describe the word LOVE.
Love is a process of feeling toward someone or something, Love can be developed,  Love can grow like
 a like flower in your garden, you planted it, you water it, you protect it from damage,  you take all your time to take care of it, when it grown, you look at it all the time, you sniff the flowers and love the alluring smell day after day, than the life of the flowers fade away and your love for the particular flowers fade away with it, Love feeling for someone or something doesn't last forever. 
Love is like a feeling you have when watching movies or listening to a song you like, it's so interesting to you whenever you watch it or hear it, it gives you joy, you are happy but as time goes on, the feeling of love you have for that movie or song fade away not because is no longer interesting you because you develop interest to other movies or songs. Love love I don't know how to put what I have in mind about love in writing ........
Love in marriage is like multivitamin pills, sleeping pills or some drugs that get you addicted. In other for you to stay long in marriage if you married because you love the person, you will need to keep taking the love pills if not you will not survive, either you go crazy when you don't want to continue taking love pills or you go to some rehab or counselling. So in my own opinion and with the experiences I had so far in marriage and relationships, you don't really need the word called LOVE to get married to someone because is not enough, not just enough love to give in us, humans feeling are so complexity that you yourself won't understand your feelings. 
Sex in marriage or in courtship with someone is not enough to get married to that person, you can put everything together Love, sex, money...... still not enough in my own opinion, all this will fade away, you  will get tired of that good sex or your partner will. 
When you are ready to get marry to someone, look beyond those things LOVE, SEX, MONEY AGE...... those things are bonus, good to have them but not necessity, it's doesn't guarantee or assurance of paces or last long in life or marriage.
One thing you need most in marriage, courtship or in relationships with we humans as I will call it, your mind set devotion of companionship. What do i mean by this senses, there is a lot to this words or statement, if I should explain it in my own opinion....... please tell me your own opinion about all I write, am ready to learn or change my mind set if am...


Before I had kids, my friends and I would go on multiweek trips to exotic, family-unfriendly locations (think hiking through Laos). Now with kids I've avoided those trips for years, but one is coming up this year and my wife said it would be OK if I go. Now I'm excited but also really feeling like I'm abandoning my kids and wife by going off on a trip that only benefits me. Do any of you do such or have spouses that take independent vacations? I'm thinking of just calling the whole thing off.
My husband goes on a week long trip with his guy friends every year. Not a big deal for us
From a child's perspective (obviously I'm older now), my dad goes and used to go on trips with his friends all the time. His good friend has a timeshare in Mexico and my dad visits every so often. It was never an issue in my family. 
Go! Life is for living, you have to have some free-time for yourself. I've never really understood people that think when you're married/have kids you have to stop having fun yourself.  Happy mummy = happy kids.

My wife is off with a friend this weekend and it makes me really happy. I actually enjoy having the three kids to myself, we have a lot of fun. 
If your relationship is healthy with your wife and kids -- then this is completely good. You don't stop being an individual in a family. If your wife wanted to go with her girlfriend to someplace, would you be ok with that? Probably would. 

If you were doing this a lot, if your wife and kids were complaining, if you were wanting to be away--then I'd say caution--you need to work on things.

Just the fact that you are so conflicted about it tells me that it is ok for you to go. Have a great time. Take lots of pics. Facetime with the family when you can. And buy gifts.

Then have some quality time with the family when you get back.

Did your mother get to do the same?
I don't think she ever chose to. 
Today, I told my mom that I don't lover her like a daughter should love her mother. I love my sister,  that I know because I would literally do everything for her, I care about her very much from the bottom of my heart. But I don't feel that way towards my mom and that makes me feel sad, guilty and depressed. 

We are an Asian family, I was born and raised in Canada, but my parents were not. Growing up, it was tough for my parents to make ends meet. They have always been working like crazy for their three children,   making sure we had the essentials in life. The thing is, it was so stressful and tense at home, my parents would fight all the time, and they would both lash out on my sister and I whenever we fucked up (we were like 5 and 7 years old, respectivally) . Especially my mom. She was verbally and physically abusive. Coming from an immigrant family, I totally get the mentality behind "whooping your kids' ass". 

But my mother was something else. She destroyed my self-esteem by saying that I was fat, stupid, that I should have my neck snapped, she threatened to beat me in front of the house so that the whole neighbourhood could watch, she threatened me while we had guests, she would beat me up really hard. When I was 10, I skipped the morning class because I stayed home very late for this math sheet that I had troubles with. My mom would teach me how to do it, but until perfection. If I messed up one answer, I had to redo the whole thing. I cried and I got beaten up for it. This kind of experience either toughens you up or makes you mentally distorted.

That was my whole childhood. Then, in high school, I started to become this rude volatile impolite teenager. I was so angry towards my mother, so the fights would get worse and uglier. Especially when I would fight back (verbally or physically). But I felt immediately bad after our fights.

The thing is, my mom loves her children dearly. We are all that she has. She has been through hell throughout her life. She never got the chance to have a proper education. She never got the chance to just chill with her friends on a Friday night while wearing nice clothes and makeup. She skipped all that because of the war in the 70s and it pretty much fucked her up. But she loves us, that I know. 

But I still don't feel any warmth or tenderness or affection when I think about her. I don't feel close to her. All I feel is pain, sadness, violent memories. I can't dissociate the past and the present. She is sick now, so she does not have the energy to be the same person, but our relationship is just too difficult. Today, we had an argument and then I just admitted to her that I didn't love her like I should. And she answered that she already knew. She knows that I don't love her, and there's nothing that can be done about that. She fucked up, and that's it. She gave everything she could give, but the ongoing stress that she had while I was growing up, just took the best of her and screwed me.

I just needed to type that. I know that we must love our mom and all that, and trust me, I'm not just going to get my university degree and ditch my parents, I will continue to support them and be there if they need me, but deep down, I don't feel anything. I do what I have to do as a daughter, and I see it more as a repayment because they sacrificed so much for me. 



I'm a 43 year old woman who could have wrote that, with the exception of being Asian (which I understand adds extra guilt and sense of obligation).  I want to tell you, it's not your fault.  Your mother has issues and that explains her behavior but it does NOT excuse it.

Thank you, that means a lot to me.

My family wants to go to disney but I really don't want to. However, they've already invited my 5 year old son, so I feel obligated to go to help out since it always helps to have extra hands with small kids... is there any way out of this? I work outdoors in Florida, so I hate to spend my precious vacation days on a place we have been to dozens of times before that's as hot as work. It's 3 nights and 4 days.
I see 2 options. As an adult and parent, sometimes you just gotta grow up and do things, even if it's not your favorite. Since you live in Florida I'm guessing this is just a 1 day thing? Not a big long vacation? 

OR, you could either say you don't have the funds to do this or to take this vacation, or turn it into a day for your son to bond with his grandparents or aunts and uncles or cousins (whoever it was that invited him), and kinda remove yourself from the equation. 
You have been there a lot, but has your son. Even if he has, Disney is magical, especially for him. I think you should go and let him enjoy the magic. You.can go places you like better when he us older.
I love my family. I appreciate my parents. I'm glad I have a sister to talk to.

But I also suffer from depression, and my parents are very overprotective, they're asian and conservative. So they take mental issues personally. Any time I'm frustrated with life, they believe I'm trying to hurt them. Any time I feel unhappy, they say things like, "Well I worked so hard to get in this country and I get no respect from you?" 

They end up guilt-tripping me whenever I say I feel depressed, saying things like, "The stress you give us is gonna cause heart attacks" or "Fine, then why don't you just kill us, you're already doing it". 

I just...I can hardly disagree or share my emotions without them saying I'm being selfish for feeling this way. It's hard, but I guess I have to accept that they are just like that. I can't keep coming to them with my problems, they don't know how to deal with it. 

Can anyone else relate?
I'm sorry. Some people are insenstive and can't understand that this isn't about them. Talk to a professional. It helps.

I got into a nasty scruff up with my father, over some stupid stuff that should've never happened if he wasn't such a stubborn dick head, so he comes up into my room as im laying there on my bed relaxing because today is a friday which means no school the next day. He comes in and looks atsome garbage i had in a little bag, it consisted of mainly pop corn bags because i like to eat pop corn while watching movies. So i look at him and sort of rudely grunt OK. Simply because im 18 years old now. Im not dumb, i realized my trasg was full, i was going to wait till my step mom, which I've nicknamed the nosey cunt, wasnt around to take it out, We dont get along you see and she has a bad habbit of going into my bedroom and snooping around. First, im 18, im no boy anymore, second, its weird she's even in there going through my personals, third, she complains about it and bitches about me and brother constantly to my father right as he wakes for work, putting him in a bad mood, so he screams to clean it up. I get up, grab the bags and stomp down the stairs pissed at the step cunt. I walk out and put the bag in the garbage and continue to walk off to the stairs. When out of no where my dad gets face to face with me. Now, im a solid 5'10/5'11, my dad is a tad bit shorter than me. Im also quite muscular because i do carpentry at a tech school and ive worked out three years straight because of sports and well girls. My dad is your average 43 year old man. Kind of chubby, hairy. He gets up into my face and yells "stop slamming shit around." And im pretty well pissed at that point, so i go to say, "i know its because that bitch was in my room and now she had to blabber about it to you." Right as i go to say the first word, he screams in my face,"STOP FUCKING SCREAMING." That triggered me, literally ive been holding in alot of anger and pain and i just let it all out, i think what did it was i though i could rely on him for anything, i thought he had my back all the time, well. He hurt my damn feelings, so i screamed right back in his face,"fuck you." He stares at me shocked for a good moment, then decides to shove me. So i scream,"dont put your fucking hands on me." After being abused by my mother for the first half of my life i wasnt having that. Plus were both adults so we know the consequences of jail etc. I fucking shoved him back, i mean hard. He stumbled backwards. He then yells,"all right tough guy, you wanna push your father, lets fucking go." My heart was pounding because this isnt your average showdown. This isnt a school fight. This is my own dad. So i scream," yea bring it asshole." He puts his hands on my shirt coller and i slap or push his hands off and away and push him again. He then puts me in a headlock and tries to flip me on the table. And i defiantly lift him up and throw him off. So at this point all you can hear is fuck you and all kinds of blabbering. My grandmother is screaming stop and whats going on is coming from the door way from the wicked bitch, followed up by oh lord and oh god. He then pushes me up against the wall and at that point iwanted to stop for my grandma. While my asshole dad wanted to prove dominance towards his wife. What shocked me the most was when he put his hands around my neck. That pissed me off bad, i mean bad. I fucking snapped and i ripped them away from me and said, touch me one more fucking time. My hand was clutched and i was ready to strike him in the face. He backed off and said something about jail and ill be on the streets etc. As i was going up stairs, he yelled. Gotta be like ( my moms last name is mine and im not including it) gotta be like those ********** just like your bitch mother. I screamed like never before fuck you!!!! As loud as possible. After that ive been sitting in my room angry and thinking and writting this. Anyone have solutions on how to clear out my head or relax and forget about it. Im angry person. Thank you and excuse my french throughout this.
Having no respect for your step mother is going to keep causing trouble. You don't have to like her, but you live.in your father's house and you need to keep your disrespect to yourself.

It should have never gotten to this point and your father should not have put his hands on you. It sounds like you all need a lesson in maturity.
Thanks a lot for the advice, trust me, theres a difference between being a child and being so called, "grown up." If your a 40 year old woman. Don't go into a person that is not biologically your son. She goes through my underwear section in the dresser. Took a box of my condoms... yea. She's been treating me and my brother like complete garbage for 10 years, so showing her respect is a less likely chance. However my father needs an apology and ill see that out tomorrow, again thanks. Oh one more than thing, even at 18, living in a parents house gives them the right to do certain things and i know that, but is it sometimes right? No. Not always. Thank you.
You need to talk to the lady and ask her to respect your boundaries. You don't go through her shit so you expect the same back. Apologise to them and move on
Hi there,


I'm conducting a study for my master's in marketing and would greatly appreciate your insights.

Thank you!

I am 28 Italian. My mom is 57 yo. 8 years ago she inherited from an old aut a huge noble house/small palace in a village of southern Italy. We are normal people and that house is probably worth more than 500000 euro. Not to talk of the furniture and the huge amount of dresses all of Armani Valentino and such. The problem is that my mom looks like she does not seriously want to sell it. She says she wants but she acts to delay the thing. In the meanwhile my parents pay a huge amount of taxes without having any return (here in Italy we pay much much more taxes than anywhere else, especially on properties). I know it should not be my business but I cannot but feel like they are wasting a "fortune". I know the origin of this fortune is in a death  (I almost did not know that aunt so I cannot feel so much bad for her and my mom has always described her as a very strict person, not exactly a fun person, the typical upper class snob single woman) but now we have had this chance so why not using it. I mean they could buy a huge house here in tuscany where we live with that money. They could start an enterprise (OK I doubt they are able). 
Also my mom is convinced that she needs to pay monthly wages (150 euro) to a woman there to "keep the house in order". Basically that woman does nothing at all because there is nothing to do. At the same time here an average salary is 1300/1500 euro  and they have a lot of expenses since my sister studies abroad in Paris.
I have suggested her to rent it in summer, I also went there to take off the clothes from furniture to make it ready to be rented hoping that it would be the start of something but nothing happened. The huge amount of clothes is still there in bags. She could simply pay someone to ship those bags here but she insists that she has to do everything on her own and of course she cannot since she works and the travel is one day by car. Also she has an old mother so she tries to spend with her all the time of holidays. 
She could simply give the charge to the woman she pays monthly to deal with the summer renting (it's Salento area and a very touristic place). With that money she could pay the taxes at least. 
I cannot but feel they could have the wealthy life she (well we) deserve but she does not want to. First years after the death of the aunt it looked normal to wait but now 8 years have passed. 
I had to insist a lot to take some pics and put the house in the market (she did not want agency) but she insists in asking a price too high so none has asked for it.
I have tried to speak with her about this (I know it's not my business but you can understand me) but it looks like a taboo. She gets angry and acts like she was offended. We cannot talk about it and things remain static.
Also that house is on 2 grounds and downstairs there is a second house rented to a middle aged woman. She does not want to send her away. I am not a cruel person believe me, I don't think that woman would struggle to find another house. I think this is another reason why she does not want to sell.

If she openly said she will never sell it I would give up but she looks divided. She says she wants in words but she does everything to delay and not taking the necessary steps. Main problem is that she says she has to see and make everything on her own, even putting a simple lock, and since its 1000 km far from here and she cannot get there easily,  time goes by. Years. 

How could I convince her that it's time to move on with life? That she has at least to sell/take away the clothes? Maybe the furniture? She needs to face the thing, stop delaying.

PS I forgot to say that my parents had to pay about 60000 euro to have that house. Its complex...Thar aunt wanted that my moms cousin (who was in troubles with law) had quickly a lot of money and threatened my mom not to give her the house if she did not send him the money. We are normal people and my parents had to struggle a little to take out all of a sudden that sum. Also my dad (who wants to sell it of course) paid a big part of that sum on its own. They still quarrel about this sometimes. 

So basically in my family there is me and my dad who want to sell against my mom who delays (and gets angry if we make her notice).  
What is the solution?
Do we have simply to accept her will since she is the owner? Even if my dad too pays the taxes for that house and paid the sum to have it?  
What could we do to push my mom to change idea? 

UPDATE: I have just tried to talk politely about that subject and I caused a terrible quarrel. My mom got upset and started to insult me. 
I understand that it is frustrating, but it is not your business. Your mom is an adult and no one can make her do anything. I am guessing she has her reasons for not wanting to sell it. That is between her and your dad. Best thing you can do is stay out of it. She isn't going to listen.
You as a family aren't communicating well at all. Besides, OP, you're sort of attacking your parents. All I've seen from the post is you demanding her to do stuff, throwing down numbers/necessities and you aren't willing to listen to her unless it's a "I'll sell" and she says it so that you can get off her back.

You want to be a helpful part of the family? Please, make her a cup of coffee or something, set the mood for a long-convo and before you say anything, address the fact that you know it's not your business (because she inherited it-- it's hers and you have no say if she decided to burn it all to the ground-- it's hers) and that you are sorry for demanding so much from her.

Proceed afterwards and ask her how she's feeling about all of this, what is her plan-- truthfully. Say that you, as a child of hers, cannot help it but to worry about her wellbeing and if she ever needed a 2nd voice, you'll be there. Let her vent and divulge into furthur issues on how to handle the house and other monetary issues around it.

You said she 'delays'. Well, let her do the talk. Your purpose should be a catalyst to her doing something!

Learn her wants, if she really wants to keep the house, see the problem as 'us vs them' aka 'us, as a family, how will we keep the house?' and not 'me vs you' 'I'm mad that you want to keep the house! Don't you see we are unable to do it?!'
My dad is paying for the taxes of the house so he should be entitled to have a word on it. 
I tried many times to talk about it in a peaceful manner but it is very hard since whatever she says sounds absurd to me or illogical. Or most of the times she begins to get angry thus every discussion ends abruptly. I have made a lot of proposals and shared a lot of ideas she does not even take into account with weird excuses, like what I said "she has to be there to do anything" (knowing that she will never be there). I try to keep myself calm, I know I cannot claim rights but I cannot say it is not my business since 5/600.000 euros more could change our life a lot in many ways. I could start a small activity and give up other things which do not suit me like what I am doing and I am forced to do. This is just an example. Anyway a sum like that could open up many possibilities. 
This was when I tried to talk about it. Now I don't do it anymore since she gets angry quickly and without a reason. 
Her official position is that she wants to sell it; the problem is that she has not even asked an estimate of the value (she says that agencies doing it have their interests) so she keeps asking the price she is personally convinced it is worth it, and none has made an offer since years. The problem is also that the house is big, but not so luxurious to be interesting for real rich people (who tend to like villas with big gardens more i guess) and not cheap enough to interest common people.  So the potential buyers are few. And if the buyers are few the value goes down for the law of the market.


Sure. But that is their business. 
I [17 F] developed a habit of spending money on iTunes, like paying the .99 to get rid of adds on an app and stuff, and then I started to use real money for games and stuff. It wasn't a problem at first but then it became habitual, but the problem is that the card that was linked to my iTunes wasn't my own, it was my dad's, and he just looked at his bill and now he's freaked out because the total cost spent on iTunes was like $450. He said he was going to all the card company and say that there must be a mistake but I told him that I messed up, they didn't, but he said something about refunds and I know that that's not going to work because none of it was falsely charged. I can pay my parents back without too much difficulty but because I'm a freelance photographer, income is really whenever people seek me out. Is there anything I can do to alleviate this situation before I pay my parents back? I've already removed both of our cards from my phone and apologized profusely but I'm still sort of panicking.

TIA
Since you don't have any money at the moment you should be doing things around the house, above and beyond what you normally do, to show him that you're truly sorry. Any bit of money you do get should go directly to your dad to pay off the bill. 
Oof I've been there too. Spending money on the ad free options and in-app purchases. (Thanks cookie run.) One thing I've now tried to make a habit of is, if it's something I want to buy that is NON-ESSENTIAL, regardless of the amount, I wait about one week. Doing this saved me from making a lot of unnecessary purchases. I think in your case, doing something of similar REGARDLESS the amount, would help. Many of the phone-related purchases are somewhat low priced, which usually gives the illusion of "Oh, I'm not spending much, it's fine", but it adds up, as you experienced. 
And another tip that I read on the subreddit "personal finances" that would potentially help change your habits is to have your phone never remember credit card information. Not only will this make you ask your dad every time you want to make a purchase, but in the future, when you have your own card, I'm sure it'll save you some money. 
Good luck amiga!
Okay, so realistically, your freelance work isn't going to pay them back in a timely manner. I recommend getting a part time job, anywhere, anything for a few months. 
Oh man, I probably wouldn't have been able to get a job if I did that, I would've been six feet under. I did something similar, but only like ~50 worth on go-gaia like a decade ago. 
Don't buy anything on itunes for a few months. They got you with the instant gratification. If you want something and feel you really have to have it, wait a day. Chances are, you will see it isn't that important. Another thing is your dad should stop linking his card to your account. If there is no card there you can't rack up charges. If there has to be a card there (I haven't used itunes in a while) then you should never buy things without asking your dad. 

You may want to check out a paid service where you have a flat rate per month. I have Google music and I love it. It was like $10 or something like that a month. Now we have a family plan, and that covers me, my husband and our two kids. 
Stop being a whale and spend money on shitty games and stuff.

Also stop being stupid. Sounds like youre not that rich with your Job so why dafuq spend 450 on ITUNES!!!! 

Best thing to do is to rethink your life choices.







P.s. i know im a dickhead, look at my karma level.
Yeah that's a good point, thank you
Freelance photography actually pays pretty well, averaging about $200 per shoot, I'd need like two jobs to pay the back. But I don't have a definitive shoot until April 1, where I'm actually making around $500 for an event but I'm hiring another photographer to help cover it, so cut that in half roughly. I'm thinking about getting a part time job though. Thanks for your advice. 

And oh gosh, Go Gaia hahah
Thanks so much for this, that sounds like a good idea.
Thank you, mighty galactus dickhead, I'll try that
Oh, if you have guaranteed work lined up, and your parents can wait that long, that's wonderful! Beats waiting 2-3 weeks for the check, so that'd get paid back same time frame anyways.

My parents were paycheck to paycheck people, so even the smallest calculation error was doomsday. I had to baby sit every kid in the neighborhood as soon as they saw the bill. Oh yes, puts that into perspective. Forgot they changed it to gaiaonline.
So I have a grandmother who died last year. I have a question ( she didnt like him lol and didnt know him personalyl) but he always says crazy stuff like " ill beat anyone on my aunt" hes always bringing her name into stuff, am I being too sensitive?
Is he insulting her or talking bad about her? If he just brings her up in conversations there is nothing wrong with that, but if he is saying mean things about her maybe you could talk to him privately and explain that you love and miss your grandmother and would appreciate if he didn't talk like her about that around you.
Hi,
I'll first give some info about my family before writing anything.
1)My father
Born in the 70's in the USSR,he was for the most of his life a thug. Working as someone of high rank in russian Mafia, he did alot of bad things in the 90's which im not aware of. Few years ago the gang was torn apart by spanish police(they did work there), some of his friends went to jail, he got away clean. Now hes working at this metal factory, because he has no education. He is in his mid-40s.
2)My mother
Born in the 70's in the USSR, I don't know alot about her,but we never got along with each other. She was raped when she was under 18(i know from her now ex-boyfriend), she is always talking alot but not of something meaningful, its always about her or something related to her. I don't like talking to her because it doesen't interest me. I mean we could have some usual dialogoue about life in general or the weather or something casual. She swears alot, not something bad but like :shit etc. She was a lesbian, had boyfriends but all the relationships lasted for only maybe 1 year or less. She has slight anger issues, because she gets angry easily, some of my friends have confirmed this one so its not just be. She is in her 40. She had a boyfriend with whom they had a child, my half-brother, but now they just fight with each other and my mom says that he is a selfish bastard and so on, that i shouldn't trust him.
3)My grandmother is in her late-60s. She has always wanted me to be a doctor. She is getting really senile, she like doesen't hear you when you talk to her, and she might say some mean things without even realizing these things can hurt a person like: (some sentence), but you can't do it. I know that her husband hit her alot and they had a bad realtionship aswll.

4)me 
I'm a male in his early-20s. I havent finished 12th grade yet, but this year as an extern i will finish the grade so i can go to the univesity. Last year when I was 19, i moved out of my mothers house to my Girlfriends because i couldn't handle the pressure of my moms demands. She always has something to do. I mean its okay, but for her everyday of the week might have something new. She buys alot of stuff, which i think are not needed like a new cupboard or something, but the old one might be like 1-2 years old. So i have to move these thing into the apartment which is on 5th floor because im the only man in her life and i get it. But it gets really frustrating at some point. Right now if ill go to her place she might tell me to hold my brother, so she can go to a dentist. After the dentist i need to sit with him for 3 hours more because she will go somewhere else. Which isnt a problem but she doesen't tell me the other thing, I usually have plans for today so i try to be productive. I would do these thing but she doesen't tell me before im done with my original task, so that messes up my plans. And when i try to reason and say that i had plans and can't she get angry. I don't like my family they make me feel worthless, my father only calls me when he is angry, so i'm the only one who calls him weekly to ask what's up and what's new, after he lost his mafia job he is more angry and pays no attention to me. 
My mom only gives me stress, but atleast she supports me math classes, and gym, so im grateful for that. My grandmother is a good person but also a bad one, which is a paradox of its kind. She sometimes makes me angry with her remarks. All my other friends have reasonable, normal parents ofcourse they might have fights but they are somehow diffrent from mine in a sense that they resolve the  issues. My fight usually end with it was your fault. I feel like i dont belong with my family, im really into politics and history and many other things. I sometimes feel that my soul age is older than my moms because she lives like shes forever 20, she get attention from men  because she is beutiful. I don't know why i wrote this but i think i will feel relieved for what answers or suggestions i will get from this thread. Cheers and sorry for the bad enlish.
My mom has also attacked me with her fists and thrown me out of the house for not doing the chores for a week.
I don't exactly knkw what you are asking for. It sounds like you have a tough life. All I can say is keep working on finishing school and get out and never look back.
Hello. I am a 32-year old man who still lives at home with my parents. I know this sounds like a very sad state of affairs. If you would like to read the backstory of my life please visit https://redd.it/4pzyx2 to read more about me.

So basically, I have reached a point in my life now where I have the desire as well as the resources to move away from home. I have tried telling me parents(my mother is especially over-protective and over-bearing) in the past that I want to begin life on my own, however they have this irrational belief that I will literally not be able to survive without them. I am then labelled by them as a traitor for wanting to "abandon them and the family". 

Almost everyone else I know has parents who were able to successfully release their children into adulthood. It may have been very difficult, however they still allowed it because that just what you do when your kids are all grown up. **Why do my parents believe they are special? Why do they believe that they are exempt from completing their final duty as parents to their child???**

I am in some serious need of encouragement in my life right now. I don't really have any friends or other trusted individuals I can talk to about this. What should I do? I am almost at the point of just leaving them one day without telling them. Please help me!! 
Stand up for yourself. Get everything ready, find a place to live, take care of everything and move out. You don't have to even tell them. Start living your own life and stop letting them emotionally manipulating you. I wouldn't even tell them where your new place is. If they want to contact you they can call or email you. Keep some distance. Show them you can do this.
I am 17 M. Now before anyone starts"You are crazy, learn to respect ur parents" and shit... lemme tell you, I only respect people if they have done something worth respecting. I have never gotten along well with my parents. I don't like to talk to my parents, because they simply don't understand me. I have always been blamed for small things, and sometimes I am totally innocent. And when I try to say that I didn't do it, all they think is that I am answering back. They always keep hoping for great things everywhere. They want me to score good grades in school, tuitions and excel in everything related to academics, but they never ask me what I really want. They never believe things that I say. They are always spying on me, and don't give me any privacy. A couple of years back, I was in the habit of watching a lot of porn, and once, I got caught. I've tried turning over a new leaf ever since then, and finally managed to do so in the past few months. But still, whenever they see me holding up my iPad, or switching tabs on my PC, they just think that I am doing it again, and ask me all sorts of questions. 
I have seen many of my friends and their fathers be like best friends. But I simply can't stand my father. He barely has any time to talk to me, and he never seems to give me a chance to improve myself. If I ever do something which he doesn't like, all I get is a scolding and/or a slap. 
I believed my Mom was kinda alright, but in the recent weeks, she too has made me feel kinda bad. She always compares me to my cousins, who I admit are miles better than me. But it sometimes hurts me, and I feel kinda low.
I am suffering from depression now, but I have no one to talk to. I don't want to talk to my parents, because I don't think they'd understand me
I don't think there's ever been a child who didn't hate their parents at one point or another.  

Edit: oh, and that thing where your friends are best friends with their parents, you'll be shocked to see how many of them will down the road say "I didn't need them to be my friend, I needed them to be my parents." 

Lastly, the parents who let you do whatever you want, are not good parents. You're parents are obviously not the best at communicating with you and getting you to understand why they do what they do, but be glad they care enough to be involved in your life. 
It sounds like a communications issue. Of course your parents want you to get good grades. What parent doesn't? Are they really not listening to you or do they just think they know what is best for you? It is great to have your own hopes and dreams. Some are realistic and some aren't. Some kids are mad because their parents don't support their idea to become professional gamers when it just is something that is not likely to happen. Or you could have a realistic aspiration that they don't listen to and that isn't fair either. That is why you need to be clear about what you want to do, why and how you plan to achieve it. 

It does sound like you are young and inexperienced. You may think you know more than you do. We were all teenagers once. We all thought we knew everything. We didn't. 
By being a friend, I mean that their parents are always with them, helping, guiding and supporting them. Whereas I feel my parents are always criticizing me. I did put in efforts to please them, but it's just as useless as my life. I just feel completely hopeless, and I don't trust them anymore
I did aspire to be a gamer, but I gave it up because I thought I was wasting my life. 
I do understand that all parents want their kids to get good grades.. but sometimes I feel overly pressurised by them. I am always made to feel small in front of my cousins. I am often humiliated.. I don't feel good when I am being compared to others all the time. My parents compare me all the time with my friends, who sometimes get better grades than I do. But when I get better grades, it suddenly doesn't matter.
I am the mother of my son and wife who is expecting thier first baby.
I decided to have a co-ed shower for them after the baby is due.
Very exciting to say the least..
Now my question and I'm not sure what the etiquette is.... I just found out my son's step mom is having a shower before the baby's born in which she is inviting all their friends ...and I was not invited!

Prior to knowing this..my guest list was going to be co-ed and I was going to invite both my ex and his wife. And even requested a list of other family members from her side of family.
At first I wasn't upset when my son called to tell me she was having a shower and I was excluded.
But the more I think about it the more upset I've become. 
My biggest concern is...who would come to another baby shower? Would it not put ppl in a spot having made them feel if they can't afford another gift? And maybe the list would get significantly smaller if all their friends were to go to the first one..
I'm feeling frustrated to point of tears... Can anyone offer some suggestions and or kind words of encouragement?  I do not like conflict and will bow out if need be..
Thanks in advance

 I would express how I feel to my son, be sure to mention that your main concern here it to not make other family or friends feel awkward or forced to come to two different showers and  let him decide what to do from there.  Or at the very least ask him to approve your guests list so that there is no overlap 

Thank you..I got it all worked out ! 
I am a 16 year old female that is currently in their third year of high school, and is still questionining their sexuality.
Now,this problem has been occurring way before, but so much shit has occurred since he's returned from his trip from Central America (which was a month ago).
My dad has suddenly become much more verbally aggressive in many cases, constantly yelling at us and not allowing any of us (not even my mom) to speak. He finds anything to point out and lecture me about it, such as leaving my phone near the coffee table, or having a B in calculus. He finds a way to insult me, such as calling me fat (he has said it directly before and he's also given obvious hints of it).It really hurts hearing your own parent point it out like that. I'm already in a state of depression, and hearing that doesn't help. My self esteem is pretty damn low, and it may have even been one  of the factors in why my relationship with my ex hadn't lasted long too.
Speaking of relationships, my dad is highly against me being in one. He has this mindset that I'm going to be a doctoror an engineer (i feel like any parent would say this, but this man is serious), and says that having a boyfriend will only distract me from getting there. But what has pissed me off is the fact that this man doesn't understand the idea of privacy. My dad had managed somehow to unlock my phone, and check all of my text messages and emails, asking "Who's this?" and "Who's that?". He's even admitted that he has come early from work to see where me and my sister go after school ends (which is a definite red flag for me that there is seriously a huge problem here). 
This man follows traditional values, with him believing in that women should follow traditional roles, and has even stated loud and clear that he'd kick out his own daughter if he ever found out they weren't straight (which is not so great for me). This is the same man who's told me that I can't cut my hair or paint my nails because "that's what whores do".
My dad has threatened me, saying he'll kick me out or won't support me if I pursue my dream job, whcih is being a grapihic designer or an animator. He tries to manipulate me and even my life choices. I undertsand why parents are harsh sometimes to their kids, but this is way past the line that I'd call strict. He pushes me down, and unfortunately, I really can't express any love or admiration for him because of the way he acts towards my sister and my mother, who also have to stand his actions and words. I've gone through this since middle school, and the result is a person who has insecurities of herself, and even has had trouble socializing and making friends.
I'm sorry this was a rant, i just had to let this out somehow.
It's no wonder you'd question your sexuality, your role model for men is just so negative and so awful.  Too bad he cannot see this...

There's always two choices in family situations like yours:  Come up with a way to gently raise your concerns and your feelings....with the help of mom, and/or your guidance counselor and/or a therapist....or come up with a way to just cope with your dad's attitudes or behaviors, at some point you'll graduate and move on.
I am so sorry you are going through this.  I am all for talking things out if it would help, but I doubt he would listen. I would say the best thing you can do is work on getting away. Save as much money as you can. Start looking into schools and seeing what you meed to do in order to qualify for a scholarship. Do whatever you can so you can gain your independence and get out of this situation.
My son is 21 today.
 He expects me to give him money all the time bcs simply I'm his mom. He has a full time job..
His dad (we r divorced) is the one who created this in him bcs he gives him money all the time.
My question is...do I still buy him a gift? He also tells me to f/off almost daily. He hasn't given me a mom's day /bday card ever!

There are a lot of issues here.

The short answer is yes, of course you get him some remembrance of his birthday.   Not acknowledging his 21st birthday is likely to facilitate even more bad feelings.

The *real* issues here aren't related to his birthday, but rather your relationship on the whole, and what you mutual expectations are.  Those need to be clarified and discussed and ultimately agreed upon..and him turning 21 is a great time to re evaluate all this in context of him now being an adult.


I wouldn't. He needs to face the consequences of his actions. He can't treat you the way he does and fully expect to get money and gifts in return. Give him a reason to reflect on his behavior and if he hates you for it? So be it. You're not going to help him if you try to protect his feelings. If he learns from this, he will thank you later. 
Quit giving him money but don't throw a tantrum because he keeps taking from you when you've taught him he can. Not his father, YOU handed out the money.  Kindly but firmly set boundaries with him. Stick to them. And for the love of all things good, you're a grown woman old enough to have a 21 year old, quit complaining he never gave you a birthday card. I have four and I've never gotten one either.  I'd rather my kids spend Hallmark money on something else frankly.  That line sounded petty.
Thank you for your response and kind words
Well said and thank you kindly for taking the time to respond

So my mother was swarming around the house talking about how we had no respect and how all the clutter and stuff was driving her insane. But the thing is, we have almost no clutter in our house, unless you count the newspaper on the coffee table as clutter. Anyways, this sort of thing has been going on for awhile now, and it is really is getting on my nerves. It's even gotten to the point where she will walk into my room when I have the door and scream at me about my 'messy' room, even though I keep it fairly spotless, besides the odd book laying on the ground.
All you can do is deal with her until you can move out.
Can you sit down and talk to her about it? Maybe talk to her and ask her what you can do to help? 
Long story short I have a single mother who moved countries to help my medical condition. In doing so she lost friends and money and had to live with her brother who is manipulating and controlling. Not physically but mentally and financially. My mother struggles with depression and has not become financially independent of him. By trying to help her I find myself in between. I need the strength to remain positive for her and get her out of the situation yet feel I don't have anyone to help me. 
I still haven't told either of them how I feel for fears of making the situation worse. Im beginning to feel helpless, lonely but have to keep up appearances. Money is beginning to be shown to me as nothing but a virus that corrupts and controls. 
Has anyone else felt like this with their own family?
How do you cope and where do you draw you r strength from?
Who do you depend on?
Your mom has to take charge here. You can't do that for her. It is sad when you feel you have no one to trust. It is hard to know where to turn, but a teacher or guidance counselor can be a good start.
I'm a 20 years old, and I have been dealing with a more than dysfunctional relationship with my mother for the most part of 8 years now. I used to think it was a teenage phase and my mother's controlling personality would wane when I moved away to university, but that didn't happen unfortunately. When I was 13 I got involved with 'emo' people and self-harm - I was a silly child, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with me, I was just immature and didn't fully understand what consequences it would have. When my family found out it was a tough year moving past it, my relationship with my mum drastically changed, and she became very controlling. I wasn't allowed to stay around friends' houses, and if they came over to stay we had to be downstairs in eyesight of my mum at all times, I had no mobile phone, all computers and other devices had passwords on which I was the only one in the family who was not allowed to know, when I used the computer it was strictly for school work and my mother had to sit in the room, if I was using the house phone to talk to a friend, my mother would often pick up the other receiver to listen in. I felt extremely isolated from everyone - my friends slowly stopped inviting me to things, or if they did I would tell them I wasn't allowed, I wouldn't even check. When I became 16, I was allowed a mobile phone, which I had to leave downstairs at night, and would be checked as when I woke up in the morning, texts which I had received overnight would be opened and read before I got my phone back. My mother did not like a particular circle of my friends, purely because of they were of a lower economic background to our family, and caused arguments and conflict with their parents on a number of occasions, leaving them in tears sometimes. We had a very up and down relationship - some weeks we were fine, then all of a sudden I would find out she had been going through my phone and seen me messaging a boy (that was usually her cause of argument) or something else she disagreed with, and would take away any liberties (seeing friends outside of school or my phone) as punishment, and constantly tell me I had broken her trust, even though I fully believed there was never any trust there in the first place.

I tried to get help from school. I had counselling during school twice. First time I didn't get anything from it because I wasn't willing to open up. Second time I had the most amazing counsellor, she really helped me understand my feelings and how to deal with them. Self harm became a real issue for me, but I managed to stop when I went to university. Once I went to the head of year, as my mum had started an argument with me over mock grades (practise exams) having been sent home which I got a B in (I was a straight A student in everything). I asked the teacher to call home and talk to my mum. He did that night, and I listened in to the conversation - he told my mum I was one of the brightest students and she had nothing to be concerned about as they at school certainly weren't. My mum came to me and told me she had gotten off the phone with the school and they had told her they were concerned about me and they would be calling me in for a chat. I was shocked. I knew then I was on my own.

University came, and I was filled with so much pent up anger and resentment of my relationship with my mum. First term was hard for me, I was still self harming and I had just started dating a guy I had met on a singing course who was going to Oxford who my mother adored, but I wasn't feeling it with him at all, and knew I had strong feelings for a guy I was in secondary school with, who was just starting university in London as well as me. I ended up breaking it off with the Oxford guy and started seeing this London guy, and my mum hated it. She hated him (she had a problem with how often I talked to him while I was at school, on one occasion printing off a copy of my mobile provider's call and text history to show me all the times she knew I was texting him), he wasn't going to as a good a university as my ex and she despised the idea of him. We have been together two and a half years now, he is doing excellently in his degree and in his internship he is doing this year, and him and I have proved to ourselves and to the people closest to us that we are very much happy and function well together. My mum has never met him and refuses to, refers to him as 'fuckface' and makes it clear at every possible opportunity to all of our family and her friends of her disagreement with our relationship. She has realised that I will not leave him to appease her, so she has taken to finding every other reason to find conflict with me now. From attacking me over my interests (I am a fan of wrestling and attend live music concerts regularly), my weight (I put on weight at university I admit, although am a size 12, eat as healthily as I can and am physical active), my grades (I am averaging a high 2:1 at university, I get a lot of first grades, but I study History at a very academically demanding university which is obviously very challenging. She has told me if I do not get a first she will not attend my graduation), among many many other things.

I don't go home very often as I can't stand being in her presence for long periods of time. Christmas, I had been home a day before she started making digs at me and causing arguments, I lost it at her and fought back (I try my best to avoid confrontation, which leads us to go for weeks on end not speaking). The day I left I vowed I was done and didn't want her in my life anymore, whether on good terms or otherwise. I was exhausted of it. She would send me links to random things on facebook and say things like, oh I thought you'd like this etc, and I would give a civil reply and nothing more, until a few weeks ago when I thought I'd give her another shot. But we are back to square one.

It is my 21st birthday next month and I was going to bring some friends home from London to celebrate with my family. Now I'm questioning whether I even want to be in the same room as her. I don't know what to do. My father, my sister and her sister have told her on many occasions that her behaviour is irrational and she needs to stop her behaviour, but she will listen to no one. I am beyond resolving a relationship with her. Frankly, I never had a mother in an emotional sense, I always felt like nothing more than a trophy to her - she continuously tells me, as if I should care, that she can't talk to her friends about me because she's embarrassed. I am not perfect, and I am more than happy to admit to any faults when they are justified and put to me rationally. But I am a hardworking, ambitious person, who is able to maintain my academic work, financial situation, and relationships all to what I believe to be a good standard at the very least.

Does anyone have any advice for me?
I empathise with you. My only advice is to try posting this in r/raisedbynarcissists aswell
your mother is abusive and if she doesn't decide to stop, lose all connection with her. She caused you to feel down upon yourself and the was for to controlling which left you to loose outings with friends and they were your items, the phone and computer and you should have the right to enjoy your hobbies/things you have/had interests in.
her saying she's embarrassed of taking about you to her friends isnt an indicator your the bad one hear, she is. And it is a shame this conflict was an ongoing thing in your teenage years onto your adult one, as teenagers need their parents the most at this time. It's a shame she doesn't change even after your sister(s) and father bringing it up, but if you want to carry on talking to her, just tell her how you've feel over all the years, telling her she was emotional abusive and that she was to controlling. Don't sugar coat or hide anything. she needs to know. If she still feels embarrassed about talking about you, still feels negatively towards you so on so forth, just tell her that i don't need a toxic person in my life. You've dealt with her for far to long, and it either needs to come down to her changing her stupid attitude, or now as you are an adult, block her from your life-(but you need to tell her why).
family counseling is an option for her to change, but your unable to force her or she'll be even more angry towards you. it's unfortunate your mother is like this, but just be bluntly honest to her about how she's made you feel over the years, if still no change, offer family counselling, if  still nothing, you deserve to not have a toxic person in you life.
You are an adult now and can choose who you see ot don't see. Set boundaries with your mom and stick to them. If she can't follow your wishes then cut contact. Some people are toxic and it is okay to walk away.
also, would you think the way your mother treated you changed you negatively? did you ever stop enjoying things that could be hobbies to you? if so then this is also a thing you have to tell your mother if you decide to do so. i'm glad you got counselling and there are still places you can go for help if you still feel bad about it to this day, if your mind is still not at rest, get help now, because you deserve to have a peaceful mind.
I believe that my mother is being crushed by everything surrounding her, including me. She is crocheting stuff and trying to sell it for a little extra money, but it doesn't go very well. There are a very few people that buy what she makes, and she puts a lot of effort. That's the first issue. Secondly, I am not able to spend much time with her. She is at work, I am school(and I am studying a lot for the final exam of highschool and to get in my dream college)   and sometimes, she leaves for work just as I get home from school, and comes back tired, at 10 PM, and we only get to see each other then, and for a short period of time, while making something to eat, then se goes to sleep. She doesn't show it, but I feel..somehow..that she doesn't do as well as she behaves. My father left before I was born, and she raised me mostly on her own, sometimes with help from other family members. I must ask you for some advice, as it is weekend, and I am home all the time, what could I do in these two days to make her happier? 
Her happiness can't be dependent on you. She has to find things that make her happy. You can do some nice thi vs to show you care. Make her breakfast, do some cleaning, maybe watch a movie with her. Let her know you love and appreciate her. That will mean a lot.
I just want to let you know you aren't alone. Dealing with the sadness of a parent can feel suffocating. 
Your happiness is also her own. Continue your school and things will fall into place. If you want to help her crocheting maybe help her with social media advertising like make her an instagram account to show her work. Free things like hugs also mean a lot :) stay strong , it's not your fault. I know it sounds so unhelpful but it's true. Also if it feels right encourage her to talk to someone impartial like a doctor or therapist. Just a thought
your mother has raised such a good son, as long as she has your love and support she will find her way.  I have a son, and you sound quite mature, do you mind sharing your age?
I will try to. Thank you very much for your help. Today, we went out and drank a soda together,right as she came home from work, but we weren't able to stay too long because she was feeling very tired. I will save up some money, go to the cinema with her and clean around the house. Thank you so much. 
I am 17. And I am very glad to have her as my mother. I love her with all I have for what she did for me since I was born. Especially as it was mostly alone, and she struggled and always tried to make me happy, and aside from others, I have learnt to enjoy life with the minimum. But what matters the most and what makes my relationship with her, is that I tell her everything I do,and tell her why I do/did it. Thank you a lot for the compliment! 
If it is no problem, might I ask how old your son is? 
It sounds like you are a good kid. I am sure your mom appreciates it. Take it from another mom :)
This is going to be a very long story. But I love writing, and this is the only way I can share my whole story.

Usually you always hear that step dads are mean, annoying and only is making your life worse and "trying to be "you're dad". That has never been the case for me. My mom left my dad soon after i've just got 4 years old. She left him because he didn't help my mom with any thing, the biggest reason was because he sometines was abusive towards here and threatend here. I still remember me crying in the stairs and saying stop hurting my mom. It's still horrible to think of to this day.

Soon after awhile my mom left my dad. We moved to a new house.  It was like a new start. I can remember my mom finnaly relaxing and being happy she was away from my abusive father. Some months later was when I met my stepdad for the first time (my dad). Mom and my step dad was only friends first, but I remember visiting him alot first. I was so happy each time I saw him and I couldn't wait to meet him again.


Soon my step dad got married to my mom and he moved in. He was taking care of my mom and I was so happy to finnaly see her smiling and feeling safe. My step dad played with me and was always there when I was bored. I was the only child back then. He was treating me so nice I can't explain. He was of course strict, but at the right time, unlike my father who always yelled at me for things I couln't control. My step dad took me to the cinemas, waterparks and everything when my mom was at work and I even called him dad sometimes without thinking about it, he was only laughing and smiling and saying it was okay if I wanted him to be my dad. 


 
I was still seeing my biological dad in the weekends, cause if he did not he would threatend my mom onterwise. But little did my mom know that he even was abusive towards me sometimes. My dad abused alchohol and always got drunk infront of me. If I was in the way or only annoying him a little he would hit me or scream at me, sometimes I got away when he was trying to do something. Of course why didn't I tell my mom? Because I thought I deserved it. I thought It was normal at that time...  Tha'ts how manipulating parents can be sometimes! My dad talked alot sh*t about my stepdad to me, saying he was not good for my mom or that he was an idiot. He manupualted me to of course think he was right.


My dad kinda destoryed my relationship with my step dad after saying those things. I loved my step dad so much but at that age I didn't understand right or wrong. So I sometimes ignored all the love and attention I got from him, something that I never should have done. After awhile my step dad thought I hated him and was acting a bit different around me than usual. I wish I could tell him everything. Then he might have gotten my father to stop this. Putted him to jail where he was supposed to be.

When I was around six was when my little beautiful sister got born. She looked so much like a mix between my mom and  step dad. But she was so alike me when I was a baby. I was so happy finnaly having someone to play with for my self. I don't know what I would do without her to be honest. She is always there for me no matter what. We are so alike it's crazy, and we are only half sisters.

Unfortunaly my mom and mt step dad had a divorce in 2009. Now it's only my mother sister, grandma and me who lives together. Still to this day everything he has done for me amazes me. I wish he only know how amazing it was for me having a father figure when my biological dad couln't be that for me, taking care of me, giving me love and raise me as his own daughter. I still have a little contact with my biological dad to this day but I still haven't gotten over everything and the awful childhood he gave me. He has tried to change but I've realize at as long he keeps drinking he only is gonna turn abusive and mad at me for no reason so I try to stay away from him and only talk to him on the phone.

But no matter what my biological dad did to me, all the love and safeness my step dad showed me is always gonna be the important thing here. I still have a little contact with my step dad but I really wish I had more. My step dad comes here once a weekend to pick up my sister to go shopping, but i'm not always here at that time. Last time I saw him he asked me for a hug and both of us became so happy. It was a really emotional moment because I hadn't gotten a hug from him since I was a child.

To be honest I haven't realized all of this my step dad (my real dad) gave me until now. It was only a month ago I decided to never meet my biological dad again. Then I thought of my step dad and realized I needed him in my life no more than ever. I will try to hang out with him as much as often my sister sees him and show him I want him in my life as my dad. I'm a little nervous but I hope he will understand how much I need him.

Thank you for reading the longest story I think you've ever seen in youre life xD. But it feels nice writing this out so everyone can hear my story or maybe relate to it. If you have experienced anything similar I would love to read you're story about it! 






It is a breath of fresh air hearing a nice story from the kids perspective of a step father.
I met my husband when I had 2 kids from a previous relationship. My oldest was 5 at the time. Their biological father are not in their lives and so my husband took them on as his own. He adores them and vice versa. I'm very lucky that it has all worked out and I found such a decent man who fell in love with my children as much as he did me. We now have another daughter together and even though they are 'step brothers and sisters' they do not consider themselves step anything.  He is their dad and their sister is their sister.
Big problem, my dad just bought this new company and my moms doesn't want him to buy it(personal reasons). They keep fighting over it and my brother said to stay out of it but what if they divorce it's pretty bad and it's going on for days they don't even talk to each other this is major trouble! Help please, what should I do? 
This is between your parents. The best thing you can do is stay out of it and let them work it out. 
How about talk to each of your parent separately? Tell them you feel sad when they fight
I'm going to be honest here just typing this down makes me nervous. I don't even know if sharing this here will help. 

Well I never had that "close" relationship with my mother. I don't think I ever will. I know other people could tell their mom anything, and their mom would actually care. I find trouble confiding to my mom, worried that she'll say my problems aren't REAL problems again. That I'm just seeking attention. 

She says there is no favoritism in this family, when she obviously favors my sister over I. I mean who wouldn't? She gets top marks in class, while I'm just a lazy bum according to her. 

There was one incident when I was 5 or 6, I answered back to my parents. I know its wrong, and I still feel sorry about it. But I cant forget what happened. My mom's face filled with rage, she grabbed my hair and pulled it. She'd often hit my with a belt, or a slipper, or even make me stand in front of a wall for an hour with my arms outstretched to reflect on what I've done. She'd even throw stuff at me, plate, books, chairs, pretty much anything in sight. And with that I lived in fear of her. She'd always make it clear that when she's the parent she's better. She's more dominant in this relationship, that my only duty is to follow her. 

I've lost count of the times i'd cry myself to sleep and now one would care. If my mom heard me she'd say I'm being dramatic. She still often makes me feel worthless in her eyes. She calls me stupid, idiotic, that I was a mistake in her life. This hurt me more than words can explain. The person who was supposed to be always by your side would say this to you. She's threatened to kick me out of the house. And it's no lying she yells how much I am so useless. 

She'd often humiliate me when I do something wrong, she'd broadcast it to relatives, my sister and even my close friends. Just giving them a reminder of everything I've ever done wrong. 

I kept all these feelings inside. All the hurt and pain and put on a smile just to stop the tears from rolling down my face. I know I'm stupid, I know I'm idiotic. I Know I'm worthless, but for once I just want to feel loved.

For once I want to stop crying myself to sleep, or crying in the shower, or even just crying. period. She tells me that I have to be this picture perfect child to everyone. but I'm not perfect. 

At one point I bordered on depression to the point of having suicidal thoughts, but I still hang onto the fact the there's a future. Things will be better someday, one day, but not today.  Most of my classmate hate going to school, I personally love going to school cuz it the only place where I escape my mom's wrath just for while. But I know school is just a temporary escape. I can't run from her forever.  I don't think I can confront her, she'd just find another way to make it my fault. Maybe it is my fault. 

I don't know how to deal with how those words sting. And each day I'm loosing hope that there's going to be a better tomorrow. I don't know if ill ever be enough in her eyes. 
It sounds like your parents are very abusive. It may help to to talk to a school counselor.
What you're describing is not normal and it's not okay. You will grow into adulthood and you can get away from it. Find an adult to trust and confide in them.
Age and gender?

We can't tell if your relationship is "Abusive", and frankly it's irrelevant what you choose to refer to it as.  What *is* important is how you feel, and it's pretty clear you feel pretty badly.  The next question is what to do about it.

Have you tried to either talk this over with her, or with a therapist?  The goal isn't to define or diagnose things, it's to come to terms with it, either by addressing it directly with the person responsible for those bad feelings, or to find ways of coping with them even though the other person might be able to, or available..to change them.
I've tried, but I back out every time with fear. I'm too much of a coward. 
Can I ask why you would ask the OP's gender? I can sort of get asking age because it would be relevant to giving advice, but I don't know what gender has to do with it, would the parent's behavior somehow be more or less excusable depending on if the OP is a boy or a girl? 
Hi I'm female, and almost 14, hope that information helped. 

A short update on what happened earlier today-

I was studying in my room, it was about 7:30 pm, when my mom barged into the room and started screaming at me. She told me to take a shower, I responded I would in a bit because I had to finish up my homework. She then started hitting me with a slipper, and then left. I still have a red mark, and it burns a little. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to keep living like this. 
Make Monday the first day of the rest of your life. With you in the driving seat. Good luck!
You have been conditioned to be afraid. It makes.sense you are scared. But you deserve help. Try writing it down. That could help 
Not about excusable.  

Accurate responses are best assured with as much basic info as possible.  
I'm so sorry you;re going thru this.

Can you talk with your dad about it, does he know the intensity of your mom's over reaction?  Maybe talk with a grand parent?  Maybe someone can intervene on your behalf.

You can talk with yuor guidance counselor and they could intervene, too.  Have you tried any of this?
My mom and dad are separated, and are getting a divorce, so I can't really talk to my dad. I've tried going to a guidance counselor, but I feel to afraid to open up every time, but i'll try again soon. 
What are you afraid of, what are your concerns about opening up to the guidance counselor?  You shouldn't be going thru all this alone, and you surely shouldn't be feeling so bad.  Start off slowly, don't go into all of it at once, just a bit at a time.
I'm afraid the guidance counselor would talk to my mom after I open up to said guidance counselor. I'm afraid that she's going to treat me worse than how she treats me right now. 
Me and my stepmother kinda got into a little verbal conflict, nothing got out of hand, it was just a misunderstanding on my end and her being stressed out trying to make sure I'm feed and the dog is taken care of. My dads out of town so its just been us two. This was our first argument, as we usually get on very great, but I was being a bit of a shithead. During the argument she  said something along the lines of: You know what, I can't help you I'm not your mom ok I can't teach you how to be independent! Now I know technically shes right shes NOT my mom, but I was a little taken back by that. My real mom is still alive, but is out of the picture due to other reasons. After we made up she got up and gave me a hug. I told her: " I know your not my actual mom but I still "  She kinda cut in and said I know I know, I'm being a mom to you. What did she mean by that?  Afterwards I continued with vacuuming the upstairs,  I went into my bathroom for about 15 minutes just to process the whole situation and I heard her from downstairs call my name twice to ask if I was ok, I didn't answer at the moment, but when I brought the vacuum back downstairs she asked me again and we talked a bit afterwards.
It's a tough situation. It sounds like she cares about you, but it can be a little overwhelming being responsible for a person when you come into the picture later. It sounds like she worries because she doesn't know what she is doing. I'm a mom, we have to figure things out as we go. It can be frustrating and hard and wonderful and rewarding. Be patient with her. It sounds like she is trying.
We just had a family reunion at grandma's house.  The usual folks: uncles, aunts, cousins.  

One of my uncles has been "separated" from his wife for years,  he has three children with another woman. Grandma babysat for these children and occasionally shows us photos.

My uncle himself NEVER talks about his children, we are not sure why.  So these children have become the "unmentionable family members", no one is allowed to mention them at reunions, we all just PRETEND he doesn't have kids.  LOL

I guess I should respect his privacy, but I find this both funny and odd.
Honestly, My sister and I are these "unmentionable" family members that you're talking about in my family setting. We were both adopted to replace my parent's adult-child lost to leukemia, aged 19.

Now as adults it weighs a little less heavily over our immediate family. That, and my father died, so the extended family basically doesn't exist anymore.

It's whatever. I moved out at 19 and dropped off the face of the earth forever for them. Havent spoken to my sister in almost 10 years. Maybe a phone call to my mother, or from her, on major gift giving holidays. It feels better this way.
It's not at all uncommon. Sometimes it's the ones who have been kicked out, or the ones no one wants to deal with anymore, or the illegitimate ones, the ones in prison, the ones who are BAD people.

Almost all families have 'peculiar' folks in them. Some are talked about and some 'disappeared' as far as being acknowledged to exist.
Thanks for commenting.  I feel kind of bad for these three kids actually, if I were them, I would have wondered how come I never gets to meet the rest of the family.  :/
Ahhh...I see, I won't feel as awkward the next time I see my uncle then.
They probably don't think about it too much. It's just normal for them. It was just normal for us, too.
My sister and her now ex bf had problems. They have a son. Since their sons birth this guy has had a problem buying his son things. He only thinks about himself. My sister finally had enough and left him. Now he decides to start a fight with her and grabs her slamming her against the wall. Then grabs a shotgun in its case and threatens to kill himself. She gets a restraining order on him and has her friend serve him with custody papers. My sister and i were at my uncles smoking a blunt. She doesnt smoke alot the most is 4 blunts in a day. Now this guy does nothing but smoke weed and hang out with coworkers every day and all day. He smokes before work at work and after work until he decides he wants to go home. One of his coworkers is my uncle. So hes always hanging out with him after work. He got served there because thats where he always is now. At the moment of being served, my sister and i were leaving as we finished smoking. She was trying to avoid any conflict with him. He gets the papers and then starts screaming at her saying we are supposed to be family. Now i stood up for my sister telling him how are they family if you dont want to take care of them. My uncle hears this from another room and immediately gets mad and punches walls and gets in my face telling me its not my business. So hes defending my sisters bf because he is his boss. I understand all this was taking place in his house. Thats why i didnt fight him or my sisters bf. So at the end hes calling me crazy and to get out of his house. I just want to know if im wrong for standing up for my sister and nephew?

Also since their sons birth my mother bought his crib, clothes for 2 years, food, diapers, snacks, toys, everything pretty much. I went shopping with my sister and her bf one time for the baby. He only bought 3 outfits for the baby. Yet proceeded to buy a portable speaker for his phone and more outfits for himself then his son. As a caring and concerned uncle i have to ask if im crazy or not. Should i had just let it be?
If he shows up and harasses your sister, go inside where it is safe, lock the door and call the police. You need to show his picture to your sister's bosses, security, etc., and let them know if they see him to call the police as your sister has a restraining order. You should defend your sister, but you also need to stay safe.

Also, stop smoking. Your sister is about to be fighting for custody of her child. Pot is illegal on a federal level, even if it is legal in the state. This can be used against you. No one in the house should be smoking and there shouldn't be any drugs in the house. It doesn't matter if he smokes more or less. No one should be smoking around a child. And I disagree, 4 blunts a day is a lot. Smoking every single day is a lot. If she were drinking every single day it would be a problem too. In the end, the needs of the child have to come first. That means everyone has to be on the straight and narrow. 
I understand that but what i forgot to say was that she smokes and can take care of the baby herself while her baby father is always out doing whatever he wants. Nobody smokes around the child weed or cigarettes. Its all done outside of the house. No drugs are in the house and He is sleeping when she goes to smoke and he always has someone to watch him now. Before the father would drop his son off with my parents just so he could go smoke. My sister does right though she smokes. Also shes pretty much got full custody because he had a unregistered shotgun. Cops were after him for it. He ended up turning it in and himself also. So hes only allowed visitation now but at the court. Im really not worried about my safety as per my sisters and nephews. Knowing he has no weapon to flash around in front of my nephew is a relief and also that hes with people that care for him and show love now
It's not worth risking. I am not saying your sister doesn't take care of her kid, but I am saying that smoking pot can get her in trouble. It is best not to risk it. My sister is in the process of adopting a baby and it should have been an open and shut case, but she is dealing with someone else in the family who wants custody even though CPS keeps recommending this person have nothing to do with the kid. My sister has a medical license and she will not use it because she will not risk losing custody. You never know what is going to happen when the courts get involved. If he ex is spiteful, which he seems to be, he can claim she is unfit and possibly get her drug tested.
Yea if he does that hes gonna fuck it up for the both of them. They will probably take him away from both parents. Hes on a strict leash right now. So i doubt he will try that, and from what i heard cps isnt so strict about marijuana. I have a friend in p.a. whos had cps called on her. Shes gone through it a few times. She said she smokes weed and thats it. They seen that her daughter was fine and taken care of and they left. I understand your sister wants to be safe tho, i hope for the best for her. I appreciate the advice and time you gave for all this 
He has a very tiny spot on his lung, left untreated he could live for 10 years, but because of the cancer he received a PET scan and they found an aneurysm that would have killed him within months.
It is great that they found the aneurysm! 
There, I said it. I just need to get this off my chest. Everyday, I wish that I'm just stuck in a nightmare and I will wake up soon. But no, I'm in this crappy reality and there's no way for me to get out. Unless she dies, of course. 

This confession is something that the society might frown upon but please listen to me. I want to tell you a story. My real mom grew up in a well-off household. She was spoiled rotten when she was a kid. As a result, her primadonna attitude transcended until adulthood. And unfortunately, it got way worse than everyone expected. 

When my real mom married my dad, she knew that she hit the jackpot. No, my dad is not rich. He's a hard-working man who sacrificed working in Saudi Arabia to give his family a comfortable life. My real mom got everything that made everyone woman in our town jealous of her: a nice house with a provision for a swimming pool, cars, a closet filled to the brim with designer labels and of course, money. She adores money above anything else. Ironically, it's the same reason that would destroy her. She's so materialistic and self-centered that when her obsession with everything expensive got out of control, she found herself swimming in debt.

But she wasn't fazed. She knew that she could rely on my dad to pay that debt for her. But she needed a reason. A valid reason. So she lied about me having cancer. My dad, who works miles away from home, didn't have a choice but to send her money for my "chemotherapy". But her debt still skyrocketed. She had to make up one lie after another so she could pay them all off. 

My dad, having enough of her crap, refused to send her any more money. She had to sell all the gold jewelries that my dad gave me. She even sold the house that my dad bought from his blood, sweat, and tears. In just a blink of an eye, everything that my dad worked so hard for was gone. And when there was nothing for her to sell anymore, she resorted to desperate measures my forging my late grandpa's signature so that she could sell it. Fortunately, my uncle was able to buy it back from the bank. When the amount of debt got too overwhelming for her, she was arrested.

I was seven years old at that time. When I watched her being forced inside the police car, I felt relieved. At last, it was finally over. She couldn't hit me with a thick plank of wood anymore just because I refused to get my hair blowdried. She couldn't break my pencil case on my head anymore just because I refused to finish my food as I was so full. She couldn't strangle my neck anymore just because I peed on the bed. She couldn't throw a dumbbell to my brother anymore just because he came home at 7 p.m. for his basketball practice. Yes, she couldn't torment us anymore. Never had I been so happy! 

Fast forward to 12 years later. My real mom finally finished her sentence. I had been living in my late grandpa's house at that time, together with my mama (my real mom's older sister). My mama was (and still is) the only one that I will ever consider as my mom. She was the one who raised me and my siblings, provided unconditional love and support that my real mom couldn't and didn't even bother to give even before she was arrested. I've always hated my real mom for ruining our lives. She broke our family. She even destroyed our confidence because we were so ashamed to have a criminal as a parent. But our uncles still forced us to live together with my real mom. 

We tried to give her a chance, but we didn't see any changes. In fact, her attitude got worse. She would spread a lot of nasty rumors about my mama having an affair with her ex-boyfriend. She would even tell her friends that we, her children, are worthless and lazy bums. My sister almost miscarried when my witch of a mother threw an aggressive tantrum when she was already 8 months pregnant. My mama suffered from heartattack that day because of her rage to my real mom. 

To be honest, I think she was the one who triggered my mama's condition. As a result of her tantrums, my mama kicked her out from our house. But despite of that, my mama still cared for her sister. She even made sure that she had a house to live in so she asked a relative if we could rent their house. Fortunately, they agreed. She lived there for about 6 years until a year ago. 

Last January, my mama's condition got worse. She had Stage 3 Endometrial Cancer and the doctor told her that she only have a few months to live. My uncles wanted my real mom and my mama to reconcile. Left without a choice, my mama agreed. My real mom moved back in our house, much to our dismay. But I knew deep inside, my real mom wanted my mama to die because she wanted to have that house all by herself.

And so the inevitable happened last April 3. During her funeral, my real mom acted like she was the most affected of her death. My real mom is a good actress, an evil manipulator. Unfortunately, my uncles believed that my real mom was really devastated of my mama's death. 

Three months after my mama's death, I found out through my brother that my real mom poisoned my mama's mind by trying to ruin our reputation. My real mom told my mama that my brother was stealing a huge chunk of money from her medical expenses. She even added that I was worthless and ungrateful for not being able to take care of my mama. Well, I was busy working at that time because I wanted to contribute to her skyrocketing medical expenses. But no matter how much I tried to justify my actions, my mama still believed my real mom. 

My mama and I fought because of that. I even said things to her that I wish I didn't. And it's all because of my evil witch of a mother. 

Right now, my real mom is the current queen of the house after my mama's death. She threw away all of my mama's prized possessions. She would also cover the picture of my mama in the living room. I knew she's guilty and haunted by her own ghost because she did a lot of nasty things to her when my mama was still alive. 

And for that, I would always hate my mom. I wish she would just die. She emotionally scarred me and my siblings. And I couldn't see a hint of regret from everything that she did. I hate her. I really do.



I am very sorry for all you have been through. You need to get as far away from her as possible. Seriously, leave and get your own place and don't tell anyone where you live. Have a happy life without these people.
A vile person. How old are you now and your siblings? Cut contact with her. It's enough of how much she embedded herself into your lives just to ruin it.
Wow. She's such a horrible being. If you're old enough, I really think all you can do is leave that place. 
Thank you so much! I'm currently living together with my boyfriend. I usually go to my real mom's place (But if you think about it, she doesn't have the right to call that house as her own, considering what she did in the past) from time to time. But it's because I need to visit my older brother. He's unemployed and seriously depressed from our mama's death. I'm the only one he has so, yeah. And I can't take him with me yet until I'm able to balance everything financially. 
Yes, she really is a vile person. I'm 24, turning 25 this April. I'm the youngest. My sister's doing okay, I guess. She has her own family now and currently has issues on her mother-in-law. It's my brother that I'm most worried about, as he is apparently depressed from our mama's death. I know I need to act like his older sister in these tough times because I'm all that he's got. It's really difficult to be burdened with such a big responsibility of looking after my brother, but I hope I can survive. 
I just simply hate my parents. My mom took heroin, meth, and crack while pregnant with me, still does. My dad was an alcoholic who was never there for me. I was an only child who got everything I wanted as long as I behaved, but I never got what I really wanted: their love and affection. I never got that. I got cast aside. I grew up emotionally unstable. I've been to juvenile detention twice for "assaulting" my dad who slapped my mom, I have incredibly bad anger issues, hell I'm surprised my wife hasn't left me yet. I never even made it to college (I'm a drummer for a rock band, so I get good pay), and whenever my mom calls me it's asking for money which she will probably blow on heroin anyway. My dad got drunk and fell off a building. I saw his whole family at his funeral and they all had a nasty look in their eyes. I was only 14 and two of his nephews beat me up that day, saying that it was my fault he was drunk and I need to be punished. I just wanted to be loved. I never had a real father or mother. I'm very hesitant on having kids because I was a boxer in high school, and my father was too, and he didn't turn out to be such a nice man. God bless my wife, she's helped me through everything. I know this is gonna get tossed aside but I need this off my chest.
I am sorry for all you have been through. You have been through things you should never have had to deal with. Just because someone is blood doesn't make them worth your time. Getting away from these people is the best thing you can do.
I know it might sound difficult but first, you need to love yourself in order to be loved. You didn't do anything wrong. Your only fault is growing up in the hands of abusive parents. You're emotionally scarred and that's totally understandable. Your mom may or may not change. If she doesn't, the only thing that you can do is to forgive her. And that's the same with your dad. I believe it's the only way to truly heal the wounds in your heart. Love the people who are still there by your side. Your wife, your bandmates, your friends or in the future, your kids. I understand why you're hesitant to have kids, but think this over. Being a parent changes you in a way that you can't imagine. All of us deserves to love and be loved, no matter what we did or experienced in the past. I hope everything goes okay for you.
Im so sorry this happened. You can break the cycle. Be who you wanted as a role model. Seek help and stay strong. Do what keeps you your wife and kids(?) mentaly safe and get away from those that bring out the anger in you. 
Thank you for your support
No problem! I'm in the same situation as you, so I know where you're coming from. I hate my mom. She's not a drug user or anything, but she has serious mental issues that prevent us from having a normal relationship. I couldn't trust my mom with my life. And if you can, cut off all the communication you have with your mom. It's the only way for you to be healthy physically and emotionally. Wish you all the best!
Hi,

I'm posting this because I need some advice. I don't have any close friends that I can talk to and my family relationships are falling apart. I am 23/F and recently relocated across the country with my family. Since leaving our old town I feel distant from my parents and brother. My brother out right doesn't want anything to do with our relationship and is argumentative at every turn. It doesn't help that I get defensive. Either way we are bickering like cats and dogs to the point we're I don't know if I even have any love in my heart from him. 
My parents are constantly saying this it is my duty as older sister to be the bigger person and give in. I'm tired of having to compromise. I feel like my parents are treating me differently because they hold in their heads this idea of who they want me to be, not who I am. They keep saying you have changed, you're not the same person. I don't know if I have changed. I can't notice a difference. It seems as though our family has come to an impass and I'm not sure I want to continue to be apart of it. 

The other day I threaten to move out. I would do it but I don't really want to pay a higher rent. I am also anxious at the idea of having to live alone in a new city. The issue is that I have always lived at home and never really had other friends other than my family. I don't know what to do. I feel very lame being so dependent. 

I just wanted to see if I could get some other thoughts on the situation. 


I am not in your exact situation, but living with your family members for years, and especially not getting along can be Very hard. I'm not sure what's the right thing to do, but it can't all come from one single individual, your parents, your brother should want to change, compromise, or reach out to you.

The one thing that I would advise would be to try and look for a therapist or a counselor. I found one through an official psychiatry website. It made a world of a difference talking to a trusted professional, learning about what is normal and what isn't. It's hard to know what's the 'right thing' to do, sometimes there's isn't a pretty clear picture of what there is to do.
Relationships have its highs and lows. It's perfectly normal to feel distant, unloved, and alone, even though you're surrounded by your family members. It's not good to feel like you're an outcast. I guess it's time for you to have a serious talk with your family and tell them honestly how you feel. And in return, listen to what they have to say. They may have issues too that you're not aware of. If possible, you can also try counselling. Try to restore the bond that you used to have with them. The options are endless, really. And if all else fails, I suggest that you step out from your comfort zone, face your fears of living alone in a new city, and make new friends. Hope everything goes okay for you.
My brother has been an alcoholic for almost ten years now. I have seen him drunk countless times. He's a sloppy, nasty mess. Passing in and out of consciousness. Slurring his speech, telling everyone all the reasons why he hates them and why they are shit people. Telling everyone how he's a victim to their pettiness. He never remembers anything he says. He falls all over the place, occasionally craps himself or throws up while he's passed out. I've seen all the terrible things alcoholism has done to him. And I am only saying these things because the way he acts when I assume he is on meth, is very different.


He lives in my grandparents house. I go there everyday to spend time with my grandparents and mom and help them out before and after work. 


I am pretty convinced my brother is now transitioning to meth. He is flat out denying it, but has told me he has done meth a few times in the past year. I am very strongly assuming that he is. But he completely denies and guilts us when we ask. He says that he just has anxiety and acts that way because of drinking. But I think his anxiety is drug induced. Let me lay it out. And hopefully, someone with experience can tell me how to help my brother.


This Tuesday, he ditched work and said he was hanging out with some friends. Because he missed the morning shift, his boss demanded he come for the afternoon shift. My grandma told him to get ready for work, I was there in the afternoon off work and getting ready to go home. And I heard them arguing about whether or not he should go. 




-His eyes were dilated


-He smelled like nothing. No alcohol on his breath, and he usually smells like shit after his first drink


-He had a repetitive hand/arm twitch


-He was getting violent and paranoid, accusing everyone of never caring about him (meanwhile my grandparents give him a place to live, take him to work because of dui's, feed him, etc.)


-My grandma demanded he go to work, and he somehow got in the car


-they were on the freeway when my brother swung open the car door and threatened to jump


-grandpa had to get in the back seat and hold him down while grandma turned around and they drove home


-brother pushed grandparents out of the way and left again


-didnt come home until 2 am, didn't even sleep




Day after: 


-brother was in a panicked state all day


-pacing the floors of the house


-kept saying he was going to die and his hands were numb


-we tried to get him to sit, but he rummaged through the medicine cabinets and found a bunch of benadryll, ate like five pills while we tried to take it from him, and eventually passed out. 




The day after that:


-He went to work, grandma picks him up, mom grandma and I are in the dining room talking to him


-My grandma outright says it, "I know you acted like that yesterday because of whatever drug you were on the day before."


-Brother says he doesn't do that shit and just has anxiety. 


-Grandma presses him and he starts getting defensive and yelling at my grandma


-Being fed up with his bullshit, I got up and told him "We all know you are tweaking." He tries to tell us he was drunk


-I told him I have seen him drunk 1000 times, and he doesn't act like that. I told him his pupils were dilated, he was twitching and paranoid and trying to jump out on the freeway. I looked him in the eyes and said, "There is nothing you can say to get out of this, you were on meth or some kind of upper and we all know." 


-My mom started to cry and told him to stop after how much we help him and she left.


-He looked at me and hesitated, couldn't even respond, grabbed his stuff and went to his room as well. 




Now, he won't even look any of us in the face. I think he's on meth. But how can I be sure. Does it sound like meth, Reddit? How do we help him when he won't even admit it?
Stop enabling him. Regardless if it is meth or alcohol, he needs help. How old is he? It sounds like he is an adult. He should be responsible foor himself. If he can't then your grandparents need to stop babying him. He needs to clean up, work regularly and pay rent. If he can't then he needs to find somewhere else to live. If he is willing to admit he has a problem and willing to go into rehab, help him. If he won't, stop letting him get away with this behavior.
You should go through his stuff when he's gone. Look for needles/caps, aluminum foil, bent/burned spoons, small baggies, weapons, cash, sudafed boxes, pills and anything that smells of ether. Privacy/respect goes out the window in situations like this. Getting him out of your grandparents house is priority one, even if it means fighting with your grandparents home or calling the cops to do "wellness checks" on your brother to spook him out. You can worry about trying to help him after your family is safe. You can't force him to stop.
Yea, I said he was 29. He typically does work regularly. Aside from ditching that day, he is generally a "functioning" alcoholic in the sense that he works all day and usually drinks to the point of no return after work. He pays them rent weekly. My grandparents have kicked him out on several occasions for the alcohol abuse, but then he is homeless and they feel terrible. It has caused such a strain on my grandparents marriage because they argue about what to do with him. 


My mom and I have had countless heart-to-heart interventions with him. He then just lies (tells us he doesnt drink much) and drinks in private then he's back at his usual consumption rate. Occasionally, he gets resentful when I get angry with him and will do hurtful things like post bad things about me online to our friends. 

He refuses rehab for alcohol, and refuses to admit he's using some kind of amphetamine. 


I am trying to convince my family that he is on amphetamines, his behavior points to it. My family has no idea what being high on meth looks like. My grandma told him if he ever acts how he did on the day I thought he was high, she is kicking him out. I don't know if she will stick to it. 
I did. His room was rather empty. I checked most hiding spots. Lamps, bed corners and underneath, the broken vhs player attached to his old dvd. Drawers with clothes. 

The only suspicious thing I found was: my brother always complains about being broke, despite getting paid weekly at his warehouse job. I had checked his room a few days after his payday and he was, that same day, complaining about being completely broke and begging to borrow money from my grandparents. Found 300 dollars in a drawer under some stuff. Found a bunch of benadryll next to it, too (which he uses to sleep, but that doesn't necessarily point to drug use, however he does use it heavily when he acts strange).


The money could be to pay bar tabs, I am not sure as he is also an alcoholic. 

Thing is, he always comes home high after being with friends. If he's abusing meth, it's not to the point where he consumes it at home. Unfortunately, I have learned that I will likely have to wait for the crash and burn.
Did you let your grandparents know that you found $300 in his room while he was trying to bum money? It may be worth doing to show that he is taking advantage and needs tough love. 

The closest I have had to this situation is when I was living with my in laws. We get on pretty well (we were all sharing the mortgage on a huge house), and they got a call from their niece. She and her boyfriend were coming to Visit, she was pregnant, yards yadda yadda. I have lived with people who cooked for a living and could immediately tell they were using. That lead to a very interesting conversation (I thought I'd get kicked out honestly) about my crazy days and how these people would probably steal the bed out from under my mil. She wanted to believe the best of them because "family ", so my SO and I scheduled some time off so one of us was always in the house with these people so we could catch them stealing. I made quite a few references to meth and how I know the people they were meeting with here. Having a cop drop by for a "wellness check " every so often means they couldn't be obviously high or carry the good in our house. I made that house so unwelcoming and risky for her to be in while doing illegal things in that they left to stay with "friends " locally. 

I got a lot of flak from the in laws for being a cunt (I was one, and they knew it was out of character), until a week later when we got mail with the nieces name in it (keep in mind, she was supposedly only visiting). I brought up how she would have had to have sent mail here from day one, and googled squatter rights to show the in laws the trouble the could have had. They were finally spooked enough to understand.

The things I found most helpful were to be suspicious, and show the person you are suspicious. They will get angry and try to defend themselves/play the victim, but the idea of being scrutinized constantly is hated by methheads, esp with the paranoia they already have. Calling the cops for a "wellness check " shows that they constantly have to be on guard or they'll go to jail. He may try to play the family card or scare you/your grandparents. In our situation I made it clear that our house was not an easy mark, and made it unwelcome enough that they left for greener pastures. Ymmv.  I feel like talking to whichever grandparent is more sympathetic to show the dangers of alcoholism/meth/uppers would be a good bet. They can't cave the next time they kick him out.

Sorry for the formatting, on mobile. Feel free to pm any time, situations like this can be tough.
My brother has always been aloof from the rest of my family but close with me. Unfortuantely over the past ten years he has essentially stopped working and devoted his life to a cycle of right wing conservatism and nightly excessive alcohol abuse. He and his wife drink at least three or four "tervis tumblers" (24 oz drink containers) of sprite+vodka every.single.night. 

He also smokes nearly two packs of cigs a day, a habit that eventually killed our Mom and nearly took our Dad from us. 

Over Christmas and holidays I realized that there is no stopping him. He takes over every conversation and makes it about politics and he has no self control over his desire/disease to drink and smoke. 

My brother is going to die, and probably soon, huh?

His wife (42f) does absolutely nothing that I can see to help "change" or influence his decision making. She is a classic enabler, and she's helping my brother die. We come from a family of alcoholics and addicts. 

All of the things we once shared in common are basically gone now, drowned out by the booze and his hatred of anything he perceives as "liberal". He is insulting and abusive and angry. 

What would you do if you were me? Reach out to him in some lame attempt to reconnect? Or just leave it like it is....?
You can try to reach out to him, but he won't change if she doesn't want to. His wife may be an enabler, but this isn't her fault. Your brother is an adult and making his own decisions. It sounds like this is a problem that other people in your family have dealt with and unfortunately, he is caught in it too. In the end, he gets to decide the kind of life he wants to live. All you can do is try to get him to see the problem. 
I'm basically struggling with the exact same situation with my brother. What helps me is this - I have a friend who is an alcoholic, and in addition to AA she has also attended some al-anon meetings and gave me some very solid advice. I'm not suggesting that you go to an al-anon meeting, it definitely wouldn't hurt, but at the very least just give this [pamphlet on detachment](http://www.al-anon.org/members/pdf/S19.pdf) a read and see how that applies to your situation. Mainly though, this is not your job to fix, and it's not your duty to suffer because of your brother's actions. There may or may not come a time when  your brother decides to get help, just believe me when I tell you there's literally nothing you can do to make that happen. 

I get that it sucks, I used to have a great relationship with my brother, but yeah same issues. The thing is though, even though things suck now...those good times I had with my brother (and likewise you with your brother) still happened, this isn't going to take that away, it's just maybe not happening anymore. That sucks, but you know, focus on your life.
When someone abuses drugs, it affects everyone he or she knows. These effects are often felt most by family members and loved ones. Addiction can have emotional, psychological, and financial effects on those closest to the person. If you are in this situation, there are things you can do to both support your loved one and take care of yourself. Although learning to deal with addiction is a long process, it will be worth it in the end.

Here are 4 ways to deal with a drug addicted family member or loved one:

Educating Yourself About Addiction
Talking with Your Loved One
Seeking Professional Help
Persevering and Setting Boundaries

If you happen to be in Thailand, one of the best rehab centers that offers most top-notch Drug and Alcohol rehabilitation programs is Inspire Rehab. To learn more about them, visit their official website. Inspire Rehab Center - Thailand Drugs Rehabilitation

There are a lot of methods and steps to overcome an addiction. The methods used can vary according to the type, severity and length of addiction.

However, we always include in our drug rehab center different processes such as Assessment, Programming, Detoxification, Rehabilitation, and Recovery. Because we know that everybody is different, we adapt the rehab treatment to each patient’s needs. One of the main reasons why people don’t look for help when they recognize that they are addicted to a substance is shame and guilt. It is not easy to recognize that we can’t deal with this kind of problems by ourselves, but this is not a problem in Inspire Center.

By applying complementary therapy approaches and techniques, we will unearth long-standing behavior patters or negative perceptions that may be holding you back from experiencing a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

After all if you really love your brother then of course you can stop him from taking drugs.
Maybe take time to reflect on what you still enjoy in your relationship with him, and try to accept him as he is, and how he has changed. You may find some surprising insights about his perspective. From there, hopefully he can hear your concerns. It sounds like he is still important to you, even if his behavior is worrisome and views are very different from yours. Acceptance can go a long way in making the most of the time you have. For your sake I hope he will decide for himself that there are other ways to enjoy life without shortening it, but I can never presume to know what's best for another.  Just my two cents, good luck.
Sadly, there's not much to do other than let him know what you see and what your concerns are.  


So basically, my mother acts like a little spoiled brat whenever people don't please her. She asks for favours repeatedly, she does barely nothing for herself and wants people to do things for her. For example she smokes and she NEVER N E V E R buys cigarettes for herself. She always asks me or my brother or someone else to go and buy them for her. If we don't do it, she starts acting like a little b**** and saying that we never do anything for her, that next time we need something she won't help us and so on. She also is very spoiled for what concerns food. She only eats what she wants, and often expects people to cook for her or go buy her the food she wants. If she wants a piece of clothing, she is incapable of giving it up. She starts to play the victim, until someone buys it for her. It is driving me crazy, she acts like a effing princess and she does NOTHING. She doesn't work, she doesn't pay bills, she barely cleans the house, she doesn't cook, she doesn't help for any chore. She just wants more and more to a point where you HAVE to do what she wants if you don't wanna go crazy. I'm the only person in the family who has the "balls" to tell her no, and every time we argue and she makes me feel bad. For example I am trans and she always speaks to me using female nouns and pronouns. When I don't do what she wants she starts calling me a boy and stuff, knowing that that will hurt me. She's basically a manipulative sociopath and no one can stand her but no one can stop pleasing her. 
I don't know what to do! I CANNOT MOVE OUT. 
I don't know how old you are, but your mom should understand that no body, even her children are not her slave or servant. Shave have learn do things by her herself and should not depend on other people. 
Don't give into her. Let her do her own thing ser boundaries. If she won't buy things herself, she doesn't get to have them.  If she won't cook, don't do it for her. Take care of your stuff. Keep your room clean and tidy up after yourself. Move out when you can!
How often do you wash your kid? For us it is a real problem!
EVERY Day !!!
We try to bathe her every other night. If you want it to be a part of a routine, skip the soap every other night or so. 
Every other day. Every day dries their skin. Unless they are really dirty, they go every other day.
My daughter gets a sink bath or bath everyday. Her hair is washed every couple of days. Her bath is part of the bedtime routine.
Twice a week.....
Washing hair every day also?
thank you for the advice, but it seems, my kid has a huge fear...
sounds nice! :)
and how often do you wash a hair? My kid has so big hysterics! :(
Sounds great! maybe, it also depends on the age of kid.
my son is 1 year old, we dont have problems with washing.
but my 3 years old daughter is afraid to wash a head :(
And does your kid like washing? Especially washing head?..
Yes
Whenever we give them a bath. We also get big hysterics from our kids. My 4 year old is okay, but the 2.5 year old screams. We just do it as fast as we can. I can sometimes distract them with singing. I will put on music while they are in the tub. Aside from hair washing, they love the tub.
He loves bath time! I started from when he was a couple months old just dumping water on his head and he doesn't give me any problems when it's time to wash the shampoo out. I have him lean over though so it kinda rolls off his forehead and a minimal amount gets by his eyes. 
Mainly because it helps with allergies.  
My mom asked me for 500 dlls so she can pay some cosmetic tattooing school she wants to attend in February. She knows I have some money saved up from working as a seasonal wildland firefighter, I was planning on saving more money for my 4 day trip to Mexico city, 1 week trip to thailand in March and specially for my school/fire academy. 
My mom is almost 60, still strong and younger looking; she studied for cosmetology but never worked on that. My mom always buys things she doesn't need just to buy them. She has a lot! of cosmetology stuff and never uses them, I honestly doubt she is gonna work tattooing or actually make some profit from this. I been cutting back on my expending just to save some money for my trips, school and hopefully buy stuff for another season as a wildland firefighter. 

My dad is saying he won't pay for no school my mom wants because it's a waste of money. they both split the money in half but it seems like my mom never haves money. She got really mad over not getting 500 dlls. 
should I give my mom $500? 
No. It is pretty terrible she asked you. If she really wants to do it she can find a way to save up for it.
No, do not give her anything.

She wants to attend this school, she has to budget for it.
It's your money, and your decision on who and what to spend it on. Don't feel obligated to give it to her.
No ! Parents should never ask their children to have or borrow money. 
My mom is the same, she only wastes money and expect people to pay for her stuff. It is horrible that she asked you, knowing that you worked for that money and you saved it for things that are important to you. You are absolutely right and you should not give her money you've earned with honest work to pay for her stuff.
Tell her you will buy anything for home or buy food, but will not give her money for waste. 
Would you forgive your husband`s betray, if you have 2 little kids...
Depends on the circumstances. 
I would try. It would depend on the circumstances and his behavior after, including how sorry he is and how much he's willing to work on it. But, I consider cheating a mistake. It can happen, it's horrible, but I would try to work through it. Not saying everyone should feel that way, just my take. 
I am sorry you are going through this. Personally, no. If I can't trust my partner then it is pretty straight forward for me. That said, everyone is different. Only you know what you can forgive. Marriage counseling is a must if you want to work through this.
Depends on what it is... Most likely no.
Cheating it's not an error everyone can make! that's a lie! He's gonna keep doing it over and over, people don't change it's a lie they say just to get away. I know because that's what my dad always told my mom.

If you want to forgive him for cheating that's on you! If you're gonna keep fighitng with him every single time then call it quits and make your kids a favors! Don't let them grow up like me thinking it's their fault their parents always fight, they're the reason why 1 or both parents cheated on the other. 


Im sorry to hear this...but if possible dont break your family. Children are most affected and its not their fault to see that they no longer have a proper family. I know this very well. I no longer have a father even though he's alive. 
Also, I'm really sorry if you're dealing with that.
true...
Thank you. I also think that may try...
Yes, this is just my decision...
But it's so difficult to decide.
Even if it happened just once?
Your words are true! 
But sometimes it can be just once.
Thank you for the reply - now I can see the point of children...
Thank you for the answer.
And after divorce your mom did not want you talk to your father?
It is unlikely to happen just once. Behavior doesn't change randomly. And how are you supposed to trust that it won't happen again? 
My dad didnt talk to me till i became a teenager. He left when i was little..
My mom tried to get him to make amends but nothing happened..
Yes, you are right. All problem is about trust
This sounds like SUCH a ridiculous question but it's sort of at the point that it's causing problems in my day to day life. Also it'll probably be long but it's super important that I figure this out so I'd loooove any advice y'all have. 

So I'm an 18 year old female, divorced parents, just moved into my own apartment after living in grandparents/dad's house and Mom's house (joint custody thing, switched houses weekly) and I'm adjusting pretty well. However something that's been on my mind a lot lately- my 75 year old grandmother. 

I love my dad a lot but he is a strange man and my grandma ended up being more of a parent figure than him, because of this and the fact that she's always been INCREDIBLY unconditionally loving and supportive of me, I seem to have developed an unhealthy attachment to her. 

I sleep at her house one day a week every week even though I have my own home, i text her as much as possible and I am constantly worried about her well being even though she's extremely healthy for her age. 

When my lease is up next year I want to move out of state and the only thing holding me back is my fear of being away from her. I feel like our bond might be so strong that I couldn't bear to be away from her for very long. How can I work out this dependency without distancing myself too much from my grandma? Does anyone else have this problem with a parent or grandparent? Helppppp :(
It sounds like she gives you the love and support younhave needed. It is okay to be close, but worrying and obessing is a problem. Inwould start by limiting the amount of times you call. Not a lot, just a bit. I doubt she would want you to put your life on hold for her. 
My dad has colon cancer.  Hes been thru alot. Hes on hospice care for a while now.  The nurse has said he prolly has a week more to live but probably not 3.  Ive been trying to prepare son, 5 yr old, but now that it gets closer i realize how much I've been distracting myself and avoiding feelings.  I dont know what i should do to help my son prepare when ive never lost anyone so close to me.
I recently lost my grandpa to cancer too. I'm very sorry that you are going through this. 

All I can give you are some tips. Make sure it is in the afternoon, or near the end of the day, so that there are no activities to interfere with his mourning. When you sit him down to talk, make sure that what you say isn't confusing and skirting around the facts. Don't be afraid to use the words death, or dying, or cancer. Be upfront. And make sure he knows how serious the situation is. Tell him he's a big kid, and he's able to understand these things now. And be very clear that you feel sad and angry and empty too, so he knows he's not alone.
It can be very hard to deal with all this. My older daughter was just under 2 when we lost my husband's grandma. Be honest. Explain that bodies wear out and can't always be fixed. Don't be afraid to show some emotion. This is sad and it is okay to show it. Don't use euphemisms. It can confuse and scare him. I am so sorry for what you are going through. Be sure to take care of yourself during this tough time as well.
Not gonna bother you much Reddit friends. 

Certainly watched Mr Church movie. It was just awesome. Cried a few times but guys that fucking movie just showed me how I love my dearests. 

Everybody reading this have a great day.
My mother constantly calls me a disappointment because at age 24 I do not have a full time job capable of supporting myself.  My reason for this is that I need to get a graduate degree. I have a bachelor's and wanted to go to med school. However, I decided it was not for me and I I'm applying to grad school. My mother thinks that at my age people have their degrees done and have jobs in their field. She also thinks that people work full time on the side while getting PhDs or going to medical school. When I try to tell her that most people getting these degrees work part time and end up accumulating debt, she tells me that I'm just lazy and she thinks I'm lying. Am I wrong here?
I got my PHD working full time, and I have a family.  But my husband did support me through the whole thing.  But then again, why are you comparing yourself to me or anyone else? That's highly unfair.  Med school is demanding schedule wise.  At least my full time job was able to be worked around my schooling.  

Please don't let your mother dictate what you should do with life, but you should also take a good look at your future and figure out what you want.  We all have a path to walk, and every path is different.  Yours will be different than mine.  I can tell you that when I went to grad school for my masters, I waitressed and had a graduate assistantship to pay for my tuition.  I lived on my own, and I loved the independence.  You may want to look into this.  Getting out on your own will at least free you up to make your own decisions.  

What do you have your bachelors in? 
It is getting on my ever last living nerve and I don't know what to do. She's got me thinking that once my boys get older, they will never care to talk to me or even care that I'm alive. It really making me depressed that I'm going to pour my whole heart into raising my boys and then they'll just marry and not care about me at all. (She has three sons and they're ALL mama's boys so I'm not sure what her problem is.) 

I don't want any more kids. That doesn't stop her from repeatedly telling me I need to have a daughter (as if I have control over that) so I won't die alone. "A daughter's a daughter for life. A son's a son 'till he takes wife." She tells me this every time I see her! Screw that phrase. Really.  I don't plan to compete with my future daughters in law whatsoever; wives SHOULD come first. But I hope they still want to see some sometimes. Will they? 

Of course they will still care. grandma clearly has some unresolved issues of her own regarding a daughter than she's transferring on to you. My son is adult now and is as close to me as he ever was. He has a partner and is happy, and we speak daily. Don't let it make you paranoid. Just enjoy your boys x 
They absolutely will if you build that bond with them. I'm 21 and the youngest of three brothers and we're all still very close with my mom. I'm not married yet, but I live a couple hours away and am in a serious relationship and am always sure to make it home at least once a week to see her and help her out around home. My middle brother is 26 and married with kids and ensures that he brings them to visit her regularly even when his wife can't make it. The oldest is 31 and in the Navy so he isn't around, but he practically lived with her and helped out with my little sister until he left for boot camp at 28. Honestly, things are changing and you can't guarantee that daughters will stay around either, but if you raise them correctly and form a good relationship with them, you have nothing to worry about. 
45 year old son here, I love my mom and we talk quite regularly.
Your grandma is flat out wrong. If you build a good relationship with your sons you will have a good relationship. It has nothing to do with having sons or daughters.
She's so wrong about that! Clearly she hasn't heard of Mama's boys :) 
Thank you. I needed to hear this!
Thank you for your response. The only mother/son relationship I can really observe is my husband and his mom....and they aren't close at all. However, she is very odd and unable to hold a conversation. So that could be why.
Awesome
I asked this question to the photographer sub reddit. Hoping to get more insight through other people.

When it comes to Family photos which would you prefer? Your traditional posed photograph:
Example: Your family dresses up, goes to a park, and has the photographer take several different poses of you and your kin.
Or candid.
Example: You and your family have planned to spend the day at the beach, theme park, museum, etc... You hire a photographer to follow you around your "event" and capture candid moments.
Which scenario best depicts your desire for a captured moment and why? If both, please explain.
p.s. comment as a photographer and customer. I'm interested in hearing both sides of the table.
I like both. Poses are nice to get a good picture of everyone together. Candid show the personality of the people in the photo. 
Candid moments are always my favorite to photograph. When I look back at those photos, I think of the memories made. Photographs, to me, are memories. I have so many pictures of my daughter now, and I love to look back and see her smiling, laughing, crying, or sleeping... posed photographs are pretty, don't get me wrong, but I will always have a place in my heart for candids. 
Agree with this! I think poses usually work better for displayed photos, since candids aren't always super flattering. But candids are more fun to look at! 
Thank you!

Great insight!
Hello everyone I just need some insight/rant. I grew up in a Catholic family so I would always spend time with my family on Christmas. My dad, brother and sister left for the holidays so it was just my mom and I. I asked her if my boyfriend could come over for Christmas Eve dinner and she agreed. I was with her all day preparing the food and cleaning the house on the 24th. I asked her if tomorrow (the 25th) I could go to another dinner with my boyfriend and she said it was totally fine. 

So here comes the 25th I'm just relaxing in my room and my mom is going between my room and downstairs and falls asleep on the couch. I told her I wasn't sure what time my dinner was, but while she was asleep my boyfriend texted me to come to his house at 6. She wakes up while I'm getting ready and gets so upset. She starts crying saying that I would spend the day with her and now I'm leaving. She was so angry and upset with me telling me I'm such a bad daughter, that I have no feelings etc..

I'm just frustrated that I'm 22 years old, I live with her and see her every day (unless I'm out), I've always done everything she wanted me to do (stay for Christmas, go to Church, go to Polish school, dress a certain way etc) and she gets upset with me even though I told her I would be going out that day. She still hasn't really talked to me and is giving me attitude at home. 

What are your feelings about this? Is she taking this way out of hand, or does she have the right to be this upset with me? Thank you. 
It sounds like she was uoaet about being alone on Christmas, which is understandable. However, she didn't communicate that to you and you took her at her word. I would talk to her about how it upset you when you cleared this with her. You can explain that you had other obligations because you are an adult and you hope she can understand that. It happens.

For example, my sister is adopting a baby and so now her in laws, who were absent for a long time, want to spend time with her and their son and the baby. The mother in law wanted Christmas day, but my sister explained that I would be down with my kids and all her family would be there, so she could only do Christmas Eve. The mother in law agreed. Then she texts my sister that it is too much for her to cook on Christmas Eve, they had better come over Christmas day. My sister says no and says she will cook dinner. Mothe in law doesn't show up. Sends her husband with gifts for the baby and that is it. So my sister invited te baby's aunts ams their families (the baby is my brother in law's step brother's baby. He and his girlfriend passed away from a drug overdose). It was an attempt to manipulate my sister because she thought she could and she acted like a baby when she didn't get her own way. Sometimes, you have to do what you need to and accept that your mom is the one being unreasonable.
This is my dads first gf (that Ik of) since his divorce. Turns out her son likes me and I have a thing for him too! Only thing holding us back is our parents. What do I do? Go behind their backs and hope nothing goes further with my dad and his mom? Do I go ahead and tell my dad? Or should I just leave it be.
I know someone that is married to their kinda step brother, parents aren't married though. Technically not related, just seems weird but it's not incest.
You aren't related and you didn't grow up together. It depends. If you are both adults I say go for it. If you are teenagers, I would wait and see how things go.

I'll set up this story short. My mom has been been trying to connect with her daughter for the past 10 years. The end of this year she decides to finally come around. Mom invites her to christmas dinner. I have not seen my sister in 10 years and have had a decent relationship with my mom. I hate my sister for treating my mom this way. I agree to be civil (not a total dick) for the sake of my mom. My sister and her family come over slightly later than everyone else. I'm outside I head in to avoid her. She enters and proceeds to hug people. I shell up my emotions and become anxious. She says, "Give me hug" and I respond with, " nah, its been a while." The rest of the time I avoid her and then leave. I feel angry and not really sure how to deal with it. Just looking for some advice on how to process this. Thanks!
You always have the right to refuse physical contact with someone for any reason. I might have done it just to avoid the awkwardness, but you have the right to say no. 
Age?

I think your being angry and estranged from your sister for ten years not so  much b/c of the stuff btwn you but b/c of her issues with your mom is a separate post, right?

That the guest list included someone you're estranged from makes it a weird thing for you to RSVP to.  That she greeted you after ten years by making a demand is equally a mistake and an intrusion.  Tact and diplomacy are clearly in short supply in your family.

I think the larger issue here is  reassessment of the estrangement btwn you and your sister, and in context of that, decide how you want to address this smaller insult.  If you decide that ten years is long enough...your having "mixed feelings" suggest some softening on your part..then you might compose your thoughts *in general* about how things are btwn you and write her a long letter and suggest you meet to discuss this further, maybe even with a therapist.  If not, then, leave it alone and make your desire not to be in contact with her clear to everyone so you;re not placed in this situation again.
Married 25 years! One son in college.  We are currently dealing with a huge amount of stress.  #1) My wife's father, who has been in a nursing home for 10 years, is now in a hospice, awaiting death. She flew up there today.  #2) Me.  I had sinus surgery back in June.  Was doing OK, then got sick again.  Long story, but having surgery again next week.  Have been on IV antibiotics with a PICC line for 7 weeks, 3 more to go.  I am on pain, sleep, and anti-anxiety meds right now.  Pain/Sleep is because due to my sinus issue, I cannot lay down, and am in a lot of facial pain most of the day.  This includes panic attacks.  So, she has been having to deal with me and be my caregiver for the last 4-5 months.  However, the main reason I am freaking out is how my wife looks.  She has not has regular checkups in 20 years.  Over the last year, she has lost a lot of muscle mass (very visible), and has a chronic, dry cough, and just looks terrible.    I am thinking, Cancer.  She hates her job also.  He best friend was just diagnosed with Cancer.  I asked her a few months ago to please get a checkup.  She said she is under too much stress, and will "go when she is ready."  She is really going to explode from the weight of all of this, and I think she knows something is wrong, but is in denial.   The stress it is causing me of not knowing what is wrong with her is unbearable.  How do I bring this up again given all that is going on?  THanks.
I am so sorry for all you are going through. My mon had sinus surgery and they forgot to put some sort of tube in and she has breathing issues. It caused major panic attacks. So I understand how awful it can be.

It sounds like your wife is under an incredible amount of stress. This could cause issues all on its own. All you can do is sit down with her and tell her that you are very concerned and that she needs to be seen. If she fights you on it, remond her that you love her very much and worry. She is no good to herself or anyone else if she doesn't take care of herself. If you feel so inclined and you think it will help, make the appointment for her. Don't let it go. She will let it go if you do. Just let her know how much you love and appreciate her and want her to be healthy.

Best of luck on everything. I wish there were something I could do to help. It is a tough situation. I tryly wish you and your family all the best in this difficult time.
Thanks.  
TL;DR:  

-  parents make 6x more income than myself

-  I have to pay for everthing when they visit

-  they pay for everything when they visit my brothers.
-  what do, wrt personalfinance?



Wondering how yall deal with this?  It seems everytime my parents visit my wife and I (different states, far travel), I end up paying for everything, all the time.  However, when they visit my brothers, it seems they pay for everything.

We all make about the same amount of income, but I think they baby my brothers.  

On top of that, my mom's extremely wasteful, compared to my family's lifestyle.  She takes baths everynight, spending more time filling up the tub than she does sitting in the bath, she's gone through a whole ream of printer paper, printing every single email she gets, demands  the most expensive food options at the grocer, etc.

It frustrates me for two reasons:  because my parents are Dr's, making an enormous income compared to me and my (stay at home) wife (like 6x) and because they seem to do the opposite for my brothers.  I mean, she's flying from my house to my brother's house for Xmas and she sat on the phone in front of us and asked what she can pick up from Whole Foods on the way from the airport and that she wants to pick up anything he  needs for his house, yet she visits us and I pay for everything.  They visited for T-day and I paid for the entire meal, all the stuff and they didn't even ask if they could contribute...

Sorry, rant over.  
Next time they want to visit you tell them that while you would love to see them, you just can't afford the expense. Let them know that the financial strain is too much. If they would like to pay their own way, then maybe they can visit, but otherwise it is just not an option for you. They will likwly complain. Don't give in. It will get worse before it gets better. If they won't drop it, say you have to go and hang up. When they try to make it all about money you can tell them, while it isn't all about money, surely they don't want you to go bankrupt hosting them. If they can't be nice, hang up amd don't talk to them until thru can be civil.
here is what you do: Tell them i'm not paying for shit and that u r poor. If they don't understand just say tough m8s, love you,
Honestly, stop inviting them.  My father and stepmother are incredibly, ridiculously cheap, so we just don't go out with them.  
So parents are supposed to protect you, teach you what is right, what is wrong and love you right.
Well in this post I would like to know what your parents have done which makes no sense.
Stayed together. They make each other miserable. But the love each other. It is perplexing. They are terrible with money. They help people to the detriment of their own family. They mean well, but they don't always understand that they are wrong.
My parents were so determined to own a house but couldn't afford one here so they moved 3000 miles away from where their son & daughter-in-law, daughter, brother/brother in law, and parents/in laws lived.

Now they have a grandchild they've only seen once and they try to make up for not being there by spending money (they don't have) on her. 

My parents drive me crazy but I'd love to have my daughter grow up knowing both sets of grandparents.
They christened all four of us even though by the time they had kids they weren't religious.  It was to please relatives basically. 
Kind of reminds me of my parents. I never remember them being happy and they separated 7 years ago and got back together 1.5-2 years later out of convenience. Dad has a gambling problem and mum was having trouble finding a job after being out of the workforce for 20ish years.  Sounds bad, but I was more upset when they got back together than when they had broken up. 
I understand. Some people are better apart.
Hello Reddit, I'm 16 and lost my grandfather due to suicide today.....He had 2 children....My grnadmother is doing really bad and I just don't know what to say, what will help. I want to be there for her but being younger and already not knowing what to say is hard. Anything helps guys. Thanks in advance 
Say what you're feeling, share something about him you will miss, be willing to be hugged (a lot) by people who need it. Offer hugs or just be physically and mentally present, no phone/tablet/book to create distance.

Just don't disappear.

Know that whatever you do is good enough. a lot of times we wonder if you can offer enough to make a person we love feel better. Just being there is enough. If you're into practical things, maybe ask someone else in the family if there's something specific you can help with to make your grandmother's life easier. Even something simple like visiting more often or cleaning without asking, or picking things up at the store.
Thank you for the response, it means a lot.
I'm going over in a couple of minutes. Thank you for the help, I'm do everything I can.
You're welcome. Take care of yourself and your family.
Need some sort of advice, or words of support. Something. I apologize in advance for the long story.

To give some context, my girlfriend and I have been dating for two years now. We'd started going out in October of 2014, and spent Thanksgiving and Christmas separated with our own families. Last year, we did the same thing for Thanksgiving, but spent Christmas with my family. We came over Christmas Eve and stayed over on Christmas Morning. We didn't leave until the evening to go to her parents for Christmas (Both of our parents live 45 mins apart, and we were about to spend a week with her family on a cruise so we thought it'd be fair to split the holidays this way).

This year, we moved 3-4 hours away to a new city for new jobs. We love where we live now, and have made a handful of treks back home since we moved in July. We spent the entire Thanksgiving weekend, 4 days, with my family, because her family was going to be another 4 hours out of town, they weren't great at communicating plans and timing, so we couldn't spend Thanksgiving with both families.
Her parents apologized for not having things together and promised they'd be better about it in the future, and as a matter of fact had given us their Christmas plans. Since we stayed with my rents last year, we planned to spend Christmas Eve and morning with her family (they're going to be two hours out of town this year, so more traveling for us), then would go to my parents for the rest of our break on Christmas Day.

I shared this news with my mom the other day, and seemed a little flustered but overall okay with it. The next day, she called me at work leaving a voicemail that she was cancelling Christmas this year and was going to make other plans, because my sister and her family were going to be at their house on Christmas Eve, and I won't going to be there until Christmas day, that I need to give her more of a heads up so that I don't throw her for a loop, that my gf's family doesn't celebrate Christmas the same way we do, said it was too much of a hassle so she's just undoing our celebration time together because it's been tradition for her her whole life to celebrate on Christmas Eve. And she said all of this in response to me being unwilling to change the plans we already made with my gf's family.
My stepdad knows we're right, but wants me to do anything I can to make her happy. The thing is I can't be two places at once. It's not fair to my girlfriend for us to travel and bend over backwards for my family. I talked to my older sister about this and agrees with my point of view, and that mom is going to have to accept that we're both adults with our own lives.

Ever since our brother passed away 4 years ago, she's been clinging to keep us close to her. I understand why, but she's always shoved guilt on my sister and I when we do something for ourselves that doesn't make her happy (like moving out of town). She's even talked about committing suicide to us when he passed away. She always expresses her grief to us, but I feel like she forgets that she's not the only one that lost her son- our brother. It's exhausting. My girlfriend and I haven't gotten a chance to relax at home in the past month, and we're already going to be traveling more over the next couple of weeks for the holidays.

Needless to say, I feel like junk because my rents haven't spoken to me since this outburst. I don't feel like I should budge on our plans though just to appease my mom's wishes. How do I rejuvenate in the middle of this drama? What are your thoughts? And thanks for listening.
Your mom is being unreasonable and giving in is not the best course of action. She is like a toddler having a temoer tantrum. You can't give her what she wants. You made plans, they are not unreasonable, what she chooses to do is up to her. If she wants to cancel Christmas, that is up to her. If she can't share and be understanding and have a pleasant day, then maybe it isn't worth going. 
It's her choice to cancel Christmas, so sounds like she's the one ruining it instead of compromising!

What is your mom going to do when you have your own kids and you stay at home on Christmas? Don't give in, or you'll be fighting that battle your whole life.

Oh boy, there isn't really anything that you can do to make this right beyond sitting down and talking to your mom in person. 

It will be hard but you need to talk it through. It won't be fun and it will be frustrating but best to get this out now instead of letting it fester. Don't change your plans for her, otherwise you will be expected to always be there or change your plans.

 I'm speaking from experience unfortunately, I was in a similar situation with my mother and my in laws. My mom thought she'd be clever in celebrating on Xmas Eve instead of Xmas Day. Which is also what my mother in law did.
Every year we had to declare well in advance what was going on. Even then as we got closer to the holidays I'd get more and more pressure to try to change my plans. Now I'm "lucky" because my parents are 3000 miles away and I don't have to juggle people.

Unfortunately my mother in-law is still crazy.

 
YOU haven't ruined anything. Your mother is ruining things for herself but that's on her.  If you give in this time, this scene will replay over and over until you put your foot down.
My experience with similar people is they ignore you after the fight until after the situation occurs that you're disagreeing about unless you give in before  at which point they accept your 'apology' and things carry on unchanged.

If you ignore them, they'll 'understand' the situation a bit more.

It's a horrible situation to be in, always hard when you start having your own plans and don't have your usual family plans.

Your mum is clinging to you, must be awful to feel that but still want her to understand your need to break away a little to have your own life, which is the way the world works.

Stay strong and true to you.
Be nice to mum but firm in what you want. Might be the case in a few years both families come to you for xmas so it would be good for mum not to dislike the gf's family.
Kinda long story but I need suggestions.


Wife and I live far from her parents, a 9hr drive one way. New Years is the big holiday for her side of the family and they always expect us to go down there to celebrate. Her parents live comfortably in an apartment that gets way too crowded when there are 5 of us there (my wife and I, her brother, and parents) while we live in a two story house with plenty of room and then some.


The problem I am having is that we are expected to and make the long trip every year when they have never visited us up here (besides our wedding but what parent can miss that); Plus with the small apartment it is a little uncomfortable with that many people. My wife has suggested several times that they come up here since it would be so much more comfortable for everyone but her mother shoots her down every time (same thing happened last year). It is frustrating because they make no effort to come and see us and expect us to make a very long trip and travel to see them. 


On top of that, when we do visit the in-laws my wife gets a guilt trip for not spending more time there and that we see my parents/family more. Which, honestly, we do because two of siblings live in town and my parents live 4 hours away and THEY come up and see us all the time. Which I would feel bad about BUT her parents make ZERO effort to ever come visit us.


Now, not to paint her mother in a completely bad light, she does save up her vacation days to go oversees and visit her parents (my wife's maternal grandparents) and that takes up almost all of her vacation but both my wife and I feel she can spare 2 days to make the trip up here for the New Year at least once in a while. Plus my wife has to take extra time off for our trip down anyway. So either way someone has to take extra time off. I just think it's about time my MIL does instead of my wife.


My wife is fed up with making the trip down there but also wants to see her family. What I am worried about is what happens when we have children? I couldn't possibly imagine travelling with an infant/young child in a car for 9 hours because I doubt anything will change.


What should we do? Should we just cave and go see them (which inevitably might happen), should we politely make a stand and decline saying the travel is too much, should we keep trying to convince them to come up? I feel it's not fair for them to expect us to travel to see them when they won't even consider making an effort to come to see us.


TLDR: In-laws expect us to travel 9hrs to see them every New Year in a small apartment but they won't even entertain the thought of them travelling up for the holiday (or any other time, really) in our much larger house even though we've been suggesting it.
I would not go out of my way to go there all the time. If they can't make the time to come then you don't celebrate the holiday together. You don't have to light yourself on fire to kept them warm.
You're preaching to the choir here. I wish I could say we had reached some kind of success, but ultimately it has fallen back on us if we want to see them. One of my BIL & his gf have made a huge effort to visit us several times. We're thinking of moving back to our hometown next summer where all of our family is. Who do you think we're going to ensure we see? Not the family members that haven't bothered to visit us since we moved here 3 years ago.
Is it a possibility that you could ask them to come up on a bi-annual basis?
You go every second year to theirs and they are invited to yours on intervening years?
That means if they're not willing to make the effort its clearer its their choice and you don't have to travel as much.

The problem I can see with that though is if your wife's siblings come to yours, then MIL and FIL are alone. 

It's annoying when people are obstinate and refuse to make an effort even once that you've been making for years, and like you say, it'll be difficult when you have kids.
Think they'll change when you have kids? Ie, will they come up to see you?

That's not fair of them to make your wife feel bad that she doesn't visit often enough, what do they say when you ask them to stay with you?

My own father is laying a guilt trip on me for not wanting to see him at Xmas. For the first time, I was honest rather than making an excuse and explained I didn't feel it was a celebration since Xmas dinner is a reheated takeaway from the night before and him falling asleep in front of tv after half an hour and I'm still not allowed to change the channel.
He completely glossed over that and just said he was hurt I didn't want to visit.


One day my teacher whom I had known for decades had suddenly turn into another person,  I found out that he behavior was unethical, he is currently married with kid and he still approach my friend with an ulterior motive,  he start giving my friend special attention which I never seen in my life.  He start to ask my friend out after class, even for movie with him which make no sense for a teacher to bond relationship with student in such manner.  I feel disgusted of him and totally lost my respect and don't want to learn from such person. 
High school or college? Both are unethical, but one is possibly illegal. If you are in high school, this needs ti be reported immediately. If you are in college and your friend is uncomfortable, this should be reported to the dean.
Is a martial art school, my friend feel like If don't go she be making the stupid teacher angry and lost the guidance 
I'm trying to get opinions from unbiased people about my situation. The following story is factual and as unbiased as I can make it. Thanks for any help!

--

When my mother was a kid (7-16 ish years old), her father repeatedly molested her and raped her. Her mother did nothing about it and the abuse went unchecked. My mom went to college, which her father paid for, and then went to law school, again paid for by her father. She met my father ("John") somewhere between undergrad and law school. My mother ("Jane") continued to have a relationship with her father despite his past abuses. My parents got married and eventually had 3 children (myself, "Susie", and "Jr"). As young children we frequently visited and stayed alone with my mother's parents. At a young age, my sister Susie told my parents that her grandfather had been touching her in ways that "made her uncomfortable". The cycle had repeated and Susie was molested just like her mother, Jane.


My grandfather was arrested and sent to prison. My father, John, decided to file a lawsuit against my grandfather when he got out of prison. John encouraged my mother, Susie, to take the stand and testify against her father. John and Susie wanted to file the lawsuit in the name of all three of their children, but for reasons that are disputed, the lawsuit was only filed in the victim's name - Susie. Susie was granted approximately $400-500,000 after paying attorney's fees.


As Susie grew up, her parents constantly reminded her that the money was not only hers, but all three of the children's and would be used to pay for their college expenses. Susie's parents then encouraged Susie to appear before the judge in charge of her trust fund and Susie told him that "she really wanted an underground pool". $20,000 was given to Susie for the pool and it was built in her parents' backyard. The judge issued a lien against John and Jane's house in Susie's name. 15 years later, Susie's parents asked Susie to release the lien and were angry with her when she refused. The issue was left alone and the lien remains in place.


Susie and I both attended and graduated from large, Tier 1 research universities. Susie paid for both of our schooling using her trust fund, spending about $160,000 for the both of our schooling. Our brother, Jr., performed poorly in high school due to a lack of effort and motivation, although he was certainly capable of doing well. Jr. forewent a scholarship to attend a smaller, but still prominent university because he did not believe that college was worth the money and time. Later, at the urging of his parents, Jr. began to attend a local community college. He would bring grade reports home and show our parents that he was doing well. It wasn't until John and Jane found the real grade report in the trash that they realized Jr. had photoshopped the report to hide all his failing grades. Jr. eventually admitted that he had not even attended classes. John and Jane had paid for his classes at the community college and their money had been wasted. My parents were angry and disappointed. Jr. eventually moved out of one of our parents' rent houses- which he was living in for free- and moved to the city to live in his own apartment. He had a job and was paying his own rent.


Jr. wanted to gain credentialing to become a computer forensic specialist. He was very savvy with computers and would enjoy the job. He asked our parents to pay for the exam that he would have to take to become certified. He assured them that he would study hard and pass the exam with flying colors. Our parents agreed and paid the approximately $1,000 fee for Jr. to take the test. He did not pass and the $1,000 was gone.


Jr. then found a job with a decent salary working in IT for a software company in the city. It paid well and was stable income.


Jr. eventually needed a new car, and my father agreed to cosign a loan for one. Jr. promised to pay the car on time every month and John trusted him. However, Jr. did not pay his car note on time due to poor money management and multiple times our parents paid it for him. Jr. spent his money on marijuana, cigarettes, coffee, and beer before paying any bills. John's credit was ruined because of Jr.'s missed and/or late payments.


Several years later Jr. lost his job and began working as a PI for a few months. Work was slow and didn't pay as well as his previous job. After about 7 months of working as a PI, Jr. announced to his family that he would be moving to a different state to start his own marijuana growing business. However, to do this he would need $20,000. Jr.'s girlfriend lives very nearby in the same state which he plans to move to. He told John and Jane first, then myself, and then asked Susie to have dinner with him and our parents to discuss the matter. Susie knew that he would be asking for money, and she didn't want to discuss the matter with her parents because she did not think that it involved them. Susie's parents have been very much on Jr.'s side and have let Susie know that they are on his side. John and Jane believe that Susie and I have benefited from this money and that Jr. needs an opportunity to succeed. Our parents say that Jr. hasn't benefited from this money at all and that he deserves some of it and that this business will "be like his college". John then sent Susie text messages reminding her that the money was never intended to be just for her and even said "do you know how many girls get molested and never get compensation for it?" and told Susie to "do the 10 person rule. Ask 10 people what they think and that will give you an idea of what the right thing to do is."


And so, here we are. What do you think, Reddit? Should Susie give her brother the money? Should her parents be involved?
I don't think Susie's parents should be involved. It is Susie's money and it's not for anyone else to decide who it's "intended for." Susie should do what she feels is right. If she wants to help her brother, that is fine. But Jr's track record is pretty poor so if I were Susie, I would not give Jr any money. 
I agree with /u/rosegold.
It is up to Susie, but sounds like the abuse cycle has continued with your parents. She is being exploited by your parents and anyone else who takes money. Susie was the abused one. Your parents need to pay their own bills. To top it off, your mom continued to have sex with your grandpa for college money well in to adulthood. And then she offered up Susie. You may not see it that way, but it is what it is. if you disagree, sit back and think about what your mom was thinking when she left Susie there alone with him. Now she expects to profit off of that.

No way, no how, no way. Susie needs to stop giving out money. And anyone who shuns her for it was just using her in the first place.
That was very difficult to read with the super long paragraphs. 
While I agree with most of what you said, my mother did NOT have a sexual relationship with her father through college and law school. I just meant she had a "relationship" with him in that she continued to talk to her parents and didn't have him sent to prison.
Ok. But I still stand by my advice. Your sister should not be giving anyone money under this case. Which I suspect is what you were thinking anyway.
Hey, all.

I'm 24, Hard of Hearing, and bilingual in ASL and English. I'm late deafened, but have become quite involved with the Deaf community here, with a good chunk of my friends using ASL as their main mode of communication (which I love, because that means less confusion).

My boyfriend is also HH, and we both have a hard time at family functions and outings, because we find it incredibly difficult to follow conversations. My family is very loving and supportive, though they don't seem to understand how important it is to me that they learn ASL, though I've mentioned it many times. I even bring it up in conversation anytime they comment on my hearing (which happens from time to time).

I realize that, to them, it is not a huge priority - because I speak well, and that can often lead Hearing people to believe that HA's are magic and that I can follow every comment that they make - but I really want some advice on how to stress that they need to make it a priority, and not just empty promises.

My hearing has been dropping about 10-15 db's every 6 months, and it doesn't show any signs of stopping yet, so there is a high chance that it will continue and I will eventually lose it all. I'm not afraid of that, because I have found a community that I am so grateful for, but I don't want to lose my relationships with my family.
I would tell them that if they don't learn you won't be able to communicate with them. Don't be casual about it. Stress that this is about not being able to comminicate with them. You can't force them to do anything. But you can keep trying. Sign when you speak. Make it a normal part of communication. Maybe that will help.
I would send them some resources of where to learn- give them something more concrete to go on. 
I was super fortunate to learn ASL in university! But most people don't just stumble on courses and things :)
Try writing them a letter, stressing it is essential they learn ASL in order to continue interacting with you, and vice versa.  Point out that having to write down everything for you, then waiting for you to write your reply, is going to be a real pain in the kiester but that's what's going to happen if they don't learn ASL.

*THEN* start using *ONLY* ASL to communicate with people, but resort to the writing/ replying method when with them.  Sooner or later they will come to see that learning ASL is preferable to all that writing and waiting nonsense.
Signing when you speak (Sim-Com = simultaneous communication) screws with ASL. The two languages have different grammar, so it's impossible to do both at once without sacrificing one or the other (usually ASL). But I have made it clear how important it is, it's just a matter of them making the effort, I think.

I appreciate the advice, ViperBunny :)
I've given them resources, and they know where to go for free online materials. It's just a matter of committing to it :/
Good luck! 
My father and I fell apart when I began having anxiety and, later on, depression major problems. He stopped caring about who I was growing up into, my interests, who I was, basically. Doesn't help that it's always been me who finds out about his cheating on my mum.

So he had a heart attack three years ago and I was devastated. I guess we still had a faint connection back then, because the idea of  losing him, even with all the cheating he did, seemed unbearable. But the last three years have been impossible. No sooner did he leave the hospital did he go back to eating like a bull, smoking cigars and getting drunk. The lying got worse. He got a new mistress who has already threatened me on a personal level but it wasn't enough for him to give her up. My mum doesn't leave him because she says she "respects" him although she doesn't love him anymore, so, as you can imagine, my home life is a farse of the highest level, in which we all pretend to care when deep inside we couldn't care less. Or I couldn't care less.

He was readmitted into the ICU last Friday, his heart showing symptoms of failure again and fluid in his lungs. Obviously. Me and my mum both saw this coming and we spent the last three years pestering him about his health but he never listened, so this is all on him. It's all his fault. But even though that's the case, I feel awful because I don't feel anything except a sense of unjustice because I didn't do anything to deserve this nor do I feel like I should be the one to take care of him and worry. I'm just angry at him for being this stupid, angry at my mum for shedding tears for him and angry at myself because I've always considered myself to be a person with a good heart but all I can feel now is a sense of obligation and unjustice. It's selfish. It's horrible. But I can't help feeling like this.

I'm gonna have to take up his work while he's hospitalized, and I'm gonna be the one who has to speak to the doctors because my mum works during the day. But I don't want to do anything regarding him. I feel forced to do it, and I will do it as an obligation, but it shouldn't have to be me. 
I know it is hard. Remember it isn't just for him. It is for your mom. It is an unfair position to be in, for sure. Make sure to take care of yourself. It is easy to lose yourself and have your health and well being go downhill too. Best of luck.
The title pretty much says it all, but I'll go into a bit of detail.

A couple of days ago I asked my mother for some advice regarding something, but felt like I could also ask a friend who I thought would know more about the topic in question (it's to do with my profession). My mother told me that it's great that I ask people for advice, but that I should learn to stand on my own two feet and not go with what everyone else tells me. This really annoyed me, because she doesn't seem to have a problem giving me advice and thinking I should follow it, but when it comes to me taking advice from friends she makes it sounds like I'm helpless and dependant on others. Or rather, that I'm allowed to be helpless and dependant on her but shouldn't trust others. 

I challenged her and told her that in that case it should apply to everyone then, including her, and she told me that that wasn't the point she was trying to make. I told her that I saw everyone's advice as the same and she was really offended. I get that she feels like her advice should carry more importance to me but...I don't know, it just doesn't?

She basically got really annoyed and said how family advice should be classed as more important than advice my friends can give me, because 'why would you think someone you've only known for three or four years would offer better advice than someone who's known you your whole life.'

The reality is that my mother is definitely the best person to go to in a lot of scenarios, but I will also ask other people for advice if need be, and consider everyone's input equally. And in some cases, I don't ask her. Because she knows me, but there are many things I don't wish to tell her or can't tell her.

This whole conversation made me really mad, because it's just made me feel like a) I'm under her control and b) I'm a bad person for not giving her advice more importance than my friends.

Am I in the minority in feeling the way I feel about my parents' advice being the same as my friends'?
I think your mom is saying you need to do what you think is best regardless of anyone's advice. That is true. It is not bad to talk things through with people. It is also best to trust people who know something on the topic. Sometime parents have a hard time seeing their adult children as anything but children.
No I am of the same opinion as you. Everyone has different experience and perspectives and anything your friends say to you can be just as helpful as what your mom says. I find her behavior kind of strange, like some sort of weird power trip. But it kind of sounds like something you can move past. Continue to ask her for advice but also consider your friends advice whenever applicable and maybe don't really talk about it to her again. 
Yeah I mean it's not the biggest deal in the world. I was just wondering if it was normal or if I was some sort of evil daughter for feeling this way, or if this is further evidence that she's quite controlling. I guess it's kind of difficult to look past these things completely seeing as I live under the same roof as her currently.
So, I'm a half Indian, Half American 16 year old living in St Louis. My dad is American, my mom is Indian. I've always felt that my grandparents from mom's side don't like me. See, in India, they have a lot of old traditions and cultural stuff, and apparently marrying someone from another race is bad. Anyway, they came to our house all the way from India, and you know the first thing they did? The decided to THROW AWAY like half of my wardrobe because they felt it was inappropriate. I literally spend hundreds of dollars on my clothes, and they threw away half of them. They also confiscated anything leather (they're vegan) so I don't have my leather jacket or ANY of my shoes. They also threw away all my food: Gatorade, Doritos, Twinkies and Flaming hot cheetos. They insist on cooking indian food everyday. There is some Indian food I like, but they cook a bunch of rice and vegetables. They won't just let me order a pizza or something, because they say their food is better. My next gripe is that they hate my girlfriend. She drove to my house because we had a date planned. I kissed her in a totally PG way, but grandpa started yelling at me. When we got back, my grandparents yelled at me and told me no pre-marriage sex. WTF? I mean, it was literally 1 kiss. They told me if I marry her (which  most likely won't, because I'm just dating her) our kids would only be a quarter indian. I told her I'm not going to marry her, and the flipped out even more. See, in India, you're not even supposed to DATE before you marry, because they believe your husband/wife should be your one and only. I thinks it's BS, because how are you suppose to know whether someone's your soulmate if you don't date them? Also, love is loe, regardless or race or religion or whatever. So, here's the really messed up thing. They stopped me from seeing my girlfriend except for school, and they told me that they're already looking for potential wives. They say I have to marry an Indian girl. 
Your parents allowed this? That would be my gripe. Your grandparents are entitled to their opinions, but have no right to touch your belongings.
Set your foot down. Tell them to fuck off. My dad (he is from sri lanka not from india tho) is pretty liberal, but he also said something racist a while ago. I told him to fuck off and didn't visit my parents for weeks until he apologised. He said also some other things troughout my childhood, but I always reacted immediatly. 

Please note that the things they do and say are not "indian tradition" like you wouldn't call redneck-confederate-flag-racism "american tradition". It's just straight up idiotic and backwards. Don't be passive, defend yourself. Get a burger from mcdonalds and eat it slowly in front of their eyes. Tell them you will convert to Islam if they don't stop harassing you. Push all their trigger buttons until they can't think straight anymore. BUT be also friendly if they are friendly to you. Then they will eventually stop.
Well, the best advice I have for you is this- never go to India as a minor. Retain control of your papers, stay in a western country and refuse to participate in any marriage. I would literally run away if necessary. But that's just to keep yourself safe from forced marriage.

Beyond that, not a lot to do besides wait to be 18 and move out of your parents' house. If they are making you go along with your grandparents, there isn't a lot to be done about that. I'd certainly ask them to buy me new shoes if they won't ensure my old ones come back, since you can't walk about barefoot.

PS. Was recently at a gorgeous Hindu wedding. The officiant (I forget his proper title) was extremely PISSED that the white groom kissed the Indian bride in public after the ceremony was 100% complete and they *were fully married*, and gave them a mini lecture because his mic was still on. Kissing can be seen as a part of sex so it is a lot more serious to some people than others and never to be done publicly (not knowing your grandparents' religions or conservatism).
I feel for you Op.   I mean your mother came to America for a better life I'm assuming and the grandparents want to bring all the joys of a developing nation that she left behind.   That's one step forward, two steps back.   Well fuck that, you're not half Indian, you're 100% American my friend.   Stand up for the rights that you have as a red blooded American.   Tell your parents to grow a spine, and tell your grandparents where they can stick it.
You should grow a pair and stand up for yourself, I know I wouldn't let anyone throw my shit out and tell me what I can or can't do, tell them they are in America, not India.
My mom literally tells at me if I don't smile at them. My dad is afraid of ticking them off. So yeah, other than Reddit, I'm alone in this mess.
I'm a vegetarian, so no burgers lol. If I told them I was converting to Islam, they would slap me and ground me. If my parents didn't do it first. They have my parents wrapped around their finger because my parents are afraid of ticking them off. Even more so than me.
My grandparents are Hindus. I'm Hindu too, but I would consider myself liberal. Also, they're not that accustomed to US customs.
That is incredibly messed up. I am sorry.
Haha grounding isn't that bad, but if they cut of your internet too, that would certainly be inconvenient...hmm, but you don't like what your grandparents do, right? So you have to act, dude. Just complaining about it won't help. Be creative, maybe try gandhi's nonviolent resistance. Or go through their stuff and throw something in the garbage. Get a veggie burger and tell them it's beef. Or try to pretend converting to christianity if Islam is too extreme. Your options are endless and it could be quiet fun, if you play right. Get your point across that if they do shitty things to you, you will do shitty things to them.  

Edit: and why are your parents "afraid"? Do they financially depend on them?
Yeah this totally sounded like conservative Hindus to me, I grew up in a city with the most Indian immigrants in Canada. 

Fact of the matter is your views and theirs are very different and probably always will be. If you were an adult, it would not matter. But at the moment, you are not an adult and you are subject to your parents. Not to be an old fogey but get a good education, work towards a well paying field and then you can pay your own way and anyone who doesn't like your Cheetos can suck it. Until then keep your head down. And in the books.
My parents aren't financially dependant, but they've always disapproved of him, and he's trying to impress them.
Then DO something or don't complain. Your choice.
Okay. I'll do something and comment on what happend tommorow.
Good luck, dude!
Okay. So, I borrowed a cross and a Bible from my friend and made sure to read it on plain view when they were around. They freaked out, lol! O told them that Hinduism has no good stuff for me, so I converted. They called my parents, who also freaked out. If I still have internet after this whole thing is over, I'll tell you what happend.
Hahaha don't forget to mention that they are responsible for only showing you the worst sides of hinduism! I am really curious how this will play out. They *have to* recognise their wrong and abusive behaviour eventually.
my family NEVER thinks I do things right, they always think I'm going to fuck it up, harm everybody and myself, etc.
They won't let me do anything because I'm so gonna fuck it up, so I feel worthless and stupid, not good enough.

How can I talk to them about this? I live with my mother and my sister and they still treat me like I'm 5 (I'm 19). I don't feel like doing anything right now and all I want to do is cry because I feel useless.

For example, I went vegetarian this week and they are telling me "you're going to fail at this, don't even try veganism, you don't know how to feed yourself, you don't know how to do this, you won't understand nutrition, you are going to eat meat again".

I feel like I'll never achieve ANYTHING.
is there something that keeps happening that you are trying to do that they consistently don't trust you with? 
Show youbare trustworthy. Be responsible. Help out around the house, keepnyour own stuff in order and take of yourself. If you already do these things than ignore your family. 
my aunt frieda just died 20 minutes ago and I feel no emotion. am I normal
Yes. Even if you had a positive relationship with your Aunt, your mind will sometimes protect you and cause you not to feel the pain (usually referred to as feeling numb). As time goes on, as you reflect, you'll start to feel again.

What will be important in the next few weeks is ty make sure you do process your emotions, no matter how complicated they were.

I'm very sorry for your loss. <3
I went numb for about a year after my dad passed. I had momentary out bursts of hysterical crying or screaming, but for the most part I was just existing. 

You're normal. It's hard to wrap your mind around death. Don't force anything, don't feel guilty, you're not doing anything wrong and you're not abnormal. I went to counseling for a little over a year after I lost my dad. Sometimes we just need a place that feels safe where we can get our emotions out... that's at least what I needed. My family was very religious and the loss of my dad caused me to doubt everything I was taught about god and the after life... I was afraid to talk to anyone about my doubts, which just led to me stuffing my emotions or drinking them or eating them or just fucking ignoring them all together. 

Chin up champ, you got this. 
Yes you are normal. We all handle situations differently and I think since losses of relatives is such a heavy subject we can sometimes be a little too hard on ourselves. Thinking stuff like "How can you not feel anything? You should be crying now!" because that's how we believe most other people handle it, but that's not necessarily true.

Sending positive thoughts ~ !
It is called shock. You may not feel it. It could take some time to process. You understwnd what it means, but your emotions haven't caught up. Everyone grieves differently. Give your time and feel what you feel. It is okay to not be emotional just as it would be okay to be emotional. I am sorry for your loss.
That's how it always is for me. When my grandpa died I was trying real hard to fake emotion at his funeral. About 6 weeks later I saw someone who looked like him driving a van like his. Broke down and cried there. Shell shock. Sometimes we lock up the feelings that are hard to feel. It's convenient and annoying at the same time.
thank you for the condolences, my grandpa on my dads side died, when he was close to me around 3 years ago. never felt emotion.
i've had a lot of relatives pass away, especially in 2012, maybe I'm desensitized? idk
Oh, when my mom told me my grandpa died (on my dads side) I felt nothing. I woke up normal. I only saw him a few times. He didnt even speak english. He only spoke Arabic. I used to go to a workshop a lot with my dad where his old car was. Exact same car. Saw it all the time. Felt nothing
It is possible. Sometimes people experience things in different ways and that is okay. 
Need gift idea for my bfs sister, she is pretty awful and we dont really like her but we have to get her something since it is his sister.. so what are some good ideas for gifts for people you dont like ..
How old is she? Does she have any interests? How much are you looking to spend?
Yeah... people are gonna need way more information than that to give you any actual ideas 
Amazon gift card?
Hi, everyone!

I need help in my Thanksgiving project. I’m putting together an expert roundup on safe and fun activities that seniors can do during Thanksgiving. 

The question I am asking is this:

What are some safe and enjoyable activities for the elderly do you and your family do during Thanksgiving?

I know all of you are super busy, so a response of 50 words or more is enough.

I'll post this on November 18. I appreciate it if you can submit your answer before the said date. 

Just comment below if you’re interested to participate.

Thank you!

My grandmother loves to bowl on her Wii. She has taught my kids how to do the same. They play together and have an amazing time. Some of the other sports are toouch for her, but bowling seems just right. 

There is also an app called Head On, which is like a party game. I haven't tried it with my grandparents yet, but I magine it would be a lot of fun. Any traditional board game would also be great.
Mini golf

lawn bowling/ bocce ball

croquet 

jigsaw puzzles 

giant jenga

Wii games are fun for all ages

corn hole

All the above very family friendly and PC if you are more like my family cards against humanity is always a ton of fun even with some of the older generation. 


Play a card game - classic games are good, or play one of the newer games that are coming out now. Cards against humanity is my favorite to play with my grandparents :)
I don't even know if I am posting this in the right place but I want some input I'm not even sure what to think about my life. 

I'm 31 I grew up as the middle child in a family of 4 kids. I have always felt like I didn't belong in my family never that close with my siblings or parents. I was always the odd one out. 

In my early 20s I started looking for baby pictures of my self. My spouse really wanted to see them..I went to my parents who told me to go to my grandmother...My grandmother produced one baby picture but it turned out to be my cousin Tommy. She said she would find them never did. All the pictures I have are from the age 6 on yet my sister and brother born in 81 and 82 have tons of baby pictures while I was born in 85 with none.

I thought there had to be a reason maybe the camera broke or pictures were destroyed. Yet my mother never gave me a reason for lack of baby pictures and has not produced one in 10 years. 

In 2008 a woman called my grandmother's house looking for me and told my grandmother to tell me my real name. My grandmother said it was the "strangest call" but didn't get her number or what my real name is.

I'm not really included in any family events my brothers and sisters never really reach out to me. I'm kind of on my own. To make matters worse I had a traumatic brain injury at 15 and I don't remember much of my childhood. I honestly think either I am adopted OR my parents never liked me from birth. I always have thought I look like my dad but nothing like my mother. 

I want to ask them point blank about everything but I'm afraid they will think I have gone crazy. What would you guys do if you were in my situation? 


I would sit them down and ask them. It seems like something is going on. Maybe there is an innocent explaination. Maybe you are adopted. You will never know if you don't ask. You can also try looking up your birth certificate. They are public record. If you know where you were born (if it is in the US) you should be able to look it up.
Wow.

I'd ask them point blank.  Based on the history, it's not crazy at all.   How do you tolerate these nagging doubts?
Hi Reddit, my father and I do not share anything in common, and it has become difficult to maintain any communication with him because I run out of things to talk to him about. I want to get to know him better, and for us to be able to have meaningful conversations that are not boring or frustrating for either of us. Can you advice?
Find something he likes and learn about it a bit. That could give you some common ground.
Ages? A little of the history growing up?
My mom was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer in May, requiring chemo, surgery and then radiation, treatments that would last a whole year. At this time I (age 30) quit my job in another state (I didn't like the job anyway so it was an easy decision) and returned to live with her. My mom is single, doesn't have close friends and before I came lived alone. 
Her twin brother and his wife (my aunt and uncle) call about once a week. My aunt has not been to our house to visit or brought anything in four months. My uncle has been here twice to fix the toilet when it started to leak two months ago (to his annoyance). My 29 year old brother (mom's son) calls about once a week as well and comes about once every two weeks for a short time. He's brought her soup three times since she started the treatment process in June. My various cousins have called my mom once in six months and have never visited. All these people live very close (under 5 miles and don't have much going on in their lives besides the typical 9-5 woes. None have young children or other ailing relatives that require attention. My aunt and uncle watch tv at home, my brother spends a lot of time doing leisurely things with his girlfriend when he's not working).
I feel very disappointed by how they've been. My mom is the first severely ill person in the family in a long time and their ways are an indication to me of what to expect if I'm ever very ill.
I haven't expressed my feelings of hurt and resentment to anyone except my brother, after months of pleading with him to give my mom more attention because basic things like going on a walk with him brightened up her mood so much! He didn't seem to see my point and we're at a pretty bad place in our relationship now.
My birthday is coming up and my dad (parents have been divorced for a long time) is encouraging me to have a birthday dinner at a restaurant. But I don't want to share this "happy" occasion with the members of my family who neglected my mom during her difficult time. To me it's an indication of how these people will treat me if I'm ever very sick and needy.
But I know that getting the family members together would bring my dad, and even my mom, some happiness. So what would you do?
And if you've ever been in a similar situation caring for a sick parent, or shirking caring for them, help me with some advice. Your perspective is appreciated. Thanks!
That sucks that you're the only one that seems to care and is willing to sacrifice so much for her.  The rest of your family is lazy and selfish.  You are a great person for doing this!  Instead of focusing on how bad your family is you could focus on how great you are able to make your mom feel and be proud that you are different and that you have such great morals and work ethic.  If you weren't there imagine what your moms life would be like.  Be proud that you are making such a positive  difference in someones life.
People don't always know how to act when someone is sick. Sometimes they expect that you will speak up if you need anything. Sometimes they don't want to intrude. Sometimes it is too emotional and sometimes people just suck. I think what your dad wants is for you to do somethi g for you because you are working so hard to take care of your mom. It isn't an easy feat. 

If you want to see if people will step up try calling and asking them to do something directly. For example, "can you stay with my mom for an hour while I do X, " or something along those lines. If it is clear they have no interest in helping then I completely understand writing them off.
I like to create homage's to TV show introductions. My kids love this show so I made this with After Effects:

If anyone's interested, I could post my project as a template.  That might take a little work to clean it up for mass use.
This is adorable.
Thanks.
So I'm not sure if I'm alone on this one, I really hope I'm not. But whenever I come in contact with family I get extremely depressed. I've moved around a lot, my parents divorced when I was 8, I'm 19 now. It seems like whenever I get into a situation where I'm talking, looking at or even being around my own family I can't handle it. 

A few years ago, I went to thanksgiving dinner with my friend william and his entire family; we got along like a family I've never had. When it comes to my family, I just get stuck in my room when it comes to confronting them. Again, I have no issues interacting with people that aren't related to me, in fact it always works out with them being like family to me. 

If anyone can help me out or give me some advice, I would greatly appreciate it; I'm just getting tired of feeling like I'm the issue, even though I never get angry or make a fuss of being around them, I just feel alienated every single time. 

TL;DR strangers are more of a family to me than my family has ever been. 
It can be easier to deal with strangers because there is no history. There are no hurt feelings or baggage. You can just enjoy the day. You clearly have a lot of emotions that you need to deal with when it comes to your family. Figuring oit how to handle those emotions will help.
I actually had never thought about the baggage part of it! Thank you that helped me understand a large part of it, do you or anyone you know experience this?
I had a lot of issues letting go of the past. Part of what helped me was therapy. I learned that the past is the past. It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt, but living in the present helps. I also try to accept my family for who they are and not who I want them to be. That may seem silly, but it helps me set realistic expectations.
ok so backstory 

i went into my room and tried to turn on the lamp

it wouldnt turn on

so i looked at the power strip it was plugged into and all the power strips blinkenlights were off

so i unplugged the lamp AND the power strip

and plugged the lamp into the wall 

and tried turning the lamp on then 

it didnt turn on

and i asked mom to help

it was dark out so she asked for my phone to use as a flashlight

i gave it to her

then i noticed she was kneeling on top of my earbuds and i didnt want her to damage them so i asked her to lift up her leg so i could get them out

she said no

so i tried to see if i could prise them from under her leg

and she yelled at me and for good reason because i acted like a piece of shit there

and so because i am a nervous wreck from experiences in middle school i immediately went into fetal position on my bed

and then she found out that, in the dark, i had unwittingly plugged the lamp into a portion of the (unprotected) socket place where it really shouldnt go

and she got even madder but she didnt technically blow up yet

(side note: she and i have very different definitions of 'blow up' as relates to her and her standard of blowing up is never reached throughout the entirety of this anecdote including what lies below)

so i am still in nervous wreck mode spouting apologies because that is my default response to angry mother these days

she goes outside to go into the basement and presumably mess with the fuse box

and then she comes back in and orders me to get up 

in a mean enough tone of voice that it just causes me to say im sorry again

and then she yells at me and refuses to help me out with the socket any further and calls me a whiner which im pretty sure is not the correct answer to im sorry the correct answer (which she taught me herself (or maybe not because i have the memory of a goldfish that has been cremated and mixed with cow shit) so she has no right to complain) is 'its okay' or alternately 'its not okay'

and this sets me off on a feedback loop because im sorry for being sorry and i just keep apologizing more and we just start screaming at each other and i slam the door five times and call her some unprintable words because i dont just have the memory of the goldfish i am the goldfish except the goldfish is a serial killer who insists on ruining my life 

and now i cant muster up the energy to do anything except cry and apologize over and over

and over

and

over

because i am nothing but a hollow shell of regret

*an paenitet?*
You should quit apologizing for everthing all the time, as it sounds like you do. You didn't do anything wrong. Plugging a lamp into the wrong socket is nothing to apologize for. Myabe you could say "Mom, I'm sorry if I upset you, I didnt know and it wont hapoem again." Leave it at that. 

Show respect to her but also you need to stand up for yourself or she's just gunna see you as someone who crys and apologizes constantly over everything. Plus if you say it so much it gets to the point where it doesn't  mean anything to her anymore. 

It sounds like shes frustrated with you but that doesn't excuse her behavior. r/raisedbynarcissists is a good sub to check it if she's like that a lot, she might be one. 
Dad jokes. Ha. 

I have a father who cheated multiple times knowing that his wife and kids knew. I have a father who fucked a woman and gave her three kids knowing that his wife and kids knew, and recently got married to her and is living not even 5 minutes away from my mom's home. 

I have a father who literally shouted, "I fuck you every night, and you still aren't satisfied?" when he and his new wife had a fight in my mom's home. Thanks for letting me hear that, dad.

I have a father that I feel is a stranger whenever he enters our home, and I don't know how to properly talk to him, like how a daughter would usually be with her father. 
And he would leech money off of my mom, who's barely making it. And she would give him money because "he's your dad," regardless of the lack of time he spent with you in your childhood years. 

I have a father who spends more time with those three kids rather than my two kid siblings. 

So tell me, what's it like to have a father that's there for you? What's it like having someone be by you when you have nightmares, or to come with you when you have to use the bathroom late at night? What's it like just sitting down for a simple conversation of, "So, how was school?" 

What is that feeling like? What's the feeling of having someone tell you those "stupid dad jokes" every once in a while? Because I sure as hell don't know. And right now, I'd like to just imagine what it'd be like. 
I am so sorry. Your dad sounds like he really hasn't been there for you. I know it is tempting to know what it is like to have different parents, but it won't help. These are the oarents you have and learning to accept that is being realistic about it is going to help. This doesn't ean you jabe to like it. It also doesn't mean you have to have your dad in your life if you decide that you don't want a relationship with him. The truth is some people are selfish and it isn't fair. You can't cbange who your dad is, but ou can decide how much you want him.in your life.
It's probably pretty reassuring. 😭
Time and time again whether it just be over doing chores, helping out the family business, or anything else she is too lazy to do, she threatens to disconnect my phone (which she actually has been disconnecting my line once a week on average) and tries to cut off my tution so I can be drafted by the army. I do what is bearable, but alot of things are unbearable such as helping out the family business when I have WAY too much homework to do. Or not wanting to purge some foods out of my diet, she threatens me if I don't eat it. I'm 19 years old, and I don't know if that makes a difference. My mother is Asian, and my dad is white. My dad often bitches out because he, too can't take her. I can't move out because I wont be able to afford school of which I only have a few months left to graduate. I live in california so it's really tough to live on your own at 19. Especially since I'm pretty much impaired on driving. I've been at driving for three years and I've been a hazard for the road. As for going to school, I'm not even doing a degree I want to pursue.. I've been forced into her expectations and she's basically making it impossible for me to move out. She is a foreigner and she's the type everyone talks shit about. She flails her arms around and yells at everyone and asks them to hurry up (to my coworkers). (My coworkers are nonpaid interns who drive ass loads of time to just to hear her yapping when they have higher education than she will ever have). Look I know this formatting is ass. I don't have many friends because of her influence, but I'm not playing victim over that. I have no idea about living by myself and I've been wanting to move out since 16. I just wanted to get this out and hear some thoughts.
I'm sorry you don't have a better relationship with her.

Ultimately, though, you're choosing to live with her to save money. For your own sanity, you've kind of got to own that choice. Compare it to the drudgery of working another 30-40 hours a week to support yourself and I'm sure it won't seem quite as calamitous as it does now.

And get some professional intervention on the driving front.
I'm Europe right now(augbane France actually) and in a week I am joining the French foreign legion, it's a five year contract and I don't get leave for the first 18 months. I used to be in the US Army, but even with a 9 month deployment with the 25th ID, I still don't feel like I have done my part. We were not doing as much as I would have liked, and I didn't feel like I made the difference I intended on making. My family knows, but all they are asking is when I will be home, the are making plans for Christmas with me even though I told them I wouldn't be able to be there. How can I get them to understand without destroying them?
Not sure you can do much aside from replying repeating that you won't get leave for the first 18 months so you wont be available until whenever it is you will be available (February 2018 or whatever).
All you can do is be honest with them. It sounds like they are in denial. They have to work through that . You have to do what you believe is right.
Hello everyone, my girflfriend has been in the middle of some sort of issue recently. For some reason my brother in law(BIL) (living with his father (FIL)) will not talk to my mother in law(MIL) (divorced from the father) 

Recently the MIL found out, through the FIL, that BIL was having troubles with money and she wire transfered him some money, eventhough she is struggling with money also. She did not recieve any thanks from him eventhough she sent him a text asking for just a phonecall. 

MIL is now asking my girlfriend to be some sort of mediator and try to get him to talk to her mother. I know that if the guy doesn't want to talk to someone, he will just get more and more annoyed if someone keeps  bugging him about it, so I am really curious as to what other people would advice her to do in this situation.
BIL has his own reasons for not speaking to his mother. MIL is trying to turn your gf into a flying monkey. (Go-between for MIL to spy on BIL). If your gf wants to stay out of it she can. and wiring someone money they didn't ask for isn't nice, it's manipulative.
Never be the go between. Your girlfriend needs to tell her mother flat out that she is not doing to get in the middle of this. Her mother's relationship with her son is her own business and she alone is responsible for it. Getting in the middle only makes things worse and it will make your girlfriend utterly miserable. Also, it sounds like your mother in law is trying to buy her way back into her son's life and he isn't having it. If he didn't ask for the help he has no obligation to get back to her. If she think the money entitles her to anything that can explain why the relationship is bad to begin with.

Support your girlfriend in this. It sounds like you already are. Let her know it will get worse before it gets better. Her mom will begin, threaten, and try to guilt her into getting her way. Don't cave. Stick to the boundaries you are both comfortable. It isn't easy. When. I had to set firm boundaries with my mom she didn't talk to me for several weeks and I was pregnant (high risk) with her only grandchild at the time after losing my oldest at six days old to trisomy 18 less than a year before. She tried to use the fact I was at my lowest point to get me to break, but I didn't and I am much happier for it.
Pretty much, but you should carefully make a recommendation to your gf to stay out of it or at least limit to only pass simple messages on, no persuasion.
It's your gf's call. Respect that in the end and keep your own relationships the priority in your decisions.
It will be difficult for me to explain everything that has happened between my father and I over two decades but I hope by writing this down, it will help in some way. Where do I start? When I was a kid, I used to look up to and admire my father but now that I have a more objective viewpoint, all I can think is how much of a bastard he really is.
He’s in his late 60s now and perhaps what I will remember most about him when he dies are the images of abuse in the house. I’ll never forget him walking into the room and beating my mother. At the age of 10, I walked into my room after coming home from school only to see my mother crying with her top torn and my father taking pictures of her. 11 years later and I have not forgotten what my mother was wearing, the way she looked and what she was saying/crying.
I would naively think that he could change and perhaps things would get better over time. As I mentioned, he is elderly now and still acts the same arrogant, immature and childish way. Throughout our childhood, he constantly insulted my mother and us. He has brought far more pain to me than good. I was sometimes involved in the violence of the house. At 9 years old, I was hit in the face hard simply because I played with his pocket-PC whilst he was away. I don’t know how he found out because I did my best to prevent him from finding out but I do remember how hard the hit was.
Admittedly, he has done some good things for us and would provide for us financially albeit whilst nagging. He is a doctor who made more than anyone else in the neighbourhood yet constantly complained about how little money he had and how it was our mother’s fault that she did not have a salary (complicated issue that I can’t explain in this post). As a result, we were entitled to two showers a week and heaters would only be turned on when he wanted during winter.
He constantly bragged about his girlfriend he used to see and would look at girls even when our mother was watching him. He made it a point to look at them in front of her. I do feel like I have suffered a lot of trauma growing up and this has been engraved into who I am today, whether I consciously realise it or not. I am constantly under stress, afraid of loud sounds, very cynical and negative.
He once said it would be good for me to commit suicide. All that he is done seems useless. All it has achieved is make us resent him and, though I will remember him for some good things he did, I cannot conceal the terrible things he has done to us. He claims he is a success because he is well educated, an accomplished surgeon and is financially well off but what use is that if his sons despise him. Just thinking about him makes me stressed and full of hate and anger which isn’t the best for my high blood pressure. Sometimes, I can’t help but feel relieved at the thought of him dying. After what he has told me about killing myself, perhaps I shouldn’t feel as guilty as I do but I can’t help but feel that way. My mother still stays with him because she has nowhere to go and, although there are many things she has done wrong in the past as well, she has stuck out for us.
As well as the emotional scars that I can’t get rid of, I also have physical scars that are disfiguring and are reminders of the suffering I went through for many years. My self-esteem is at the lowest it can get.
There is much more that he has done but I can’t go into the details of everything so am only able to list a few things. I am not seeking to fix the relationship with my father and understand that much of the damage that has been inflicted cannot be reversed. I’m not one for talking about my experiences and feelings with other people so therapy won’t help me. I just had to let this out because I have never told anyone before about this issue and it has affected me in so many ways.
I am so sorry for what you are going through. No person should behave like your father. The most important thing to learn from him is how not to treat your SO and your kids. It sounds like your mom is trapped in this as well. You deserve better than this. I am a mom and it breaks my heart to read stuff like this. If you ever want to talk I am here. I am a mod here as well, so if posting helps, keep doing it as much as you need to. I hope you will be able to connect with other people who can help you. 
This has turned into a bit of an uncoordinated mess, so anyone who actually manages to make it through, thank you. Not sure if this is the best sub for this.

My mother for really as long as I can remember was an alcoholic, she has mental health issues that can include paranoia. When drunk (pretty much every evening and from about 1pm on a weekend) she could be extremely aggressive, mainly verbally but at times physically to both me and my dad. For example, she once attempted to slap me so hard that me putting my arm to try block it broke her finger, of course that was my fault….

I will admit I am no saint, when I was a lot younger I would enjoy pushing her buttons just to see her flip out. My dad was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer when I was 17 and once she was shouting and screaming so much at him that he in effect had a panic attack and was curled up on the floor crying and pleading for her to stop. I stormed downstairs hearing this and kicked her in the head while she was sat down and said I think “If you shout at him again I will fucking end you.” A couple of days after he died we were sat down and she started basically listing his faults, I turned around and said “Honestly, why couldn’t it have been you?” I’m not particularly proud of these incidents.

The constant shouting and screaming every night destroyed my mental health, I ended up becoming extremely depressed, self-harming and in eventually in hospital, I completely failed a year at school. I rebuilt, put most of my life back together, aced school and got accepted to med school. I still suffer with anxiety and confidence issues but I am working on it.

This brings us to today, I go back home at holidays and things are a lot better, she doesn’t drink quite as much, but doesn’t tend to get aggressive when drunk anymore. I think the death of my dad in time made her feel a large amount of guilt for how she had acted and me moving out as well to uni made her lonely. She’s now almost the flip, while there is the occasional time where she gets a bit shouty on the whole she is lovely, almost overly nice to me and has been kind enough to pay for things for me and lend me a couple of thousand for me to pay back after I graduate.

But I am just SO fucking angry at her underneath, I am angry that she nearly drove me to the verge of suicide yet brags to her friends that I am going to be a doctor like it is her achievement when she has been the single biggest obstacle in the whole process. I am angry that the last conversation I ever had with my dad was him apologising for not realising what it was all doing to me sooner. I’m angry that the last thing my dad will have known of me is me going in and out of hospital while he was fighting a far bigger battle. I’m angry that it seems this was avoidable, if she was completely untreatable that would be one thing, but when it turns out all she needed was a bit of guilt and loneliness to realise what a cunt she was that is another.

I try and hide it to the best of my ability but I can’t always. Her mum is currently ill and she is entirely justified to be upset and concerned, but just hearing her ‘moan’ about something just triggers my brain to become angry automatically because I am so used to that meaning she is either slagging me or my dad off. 

I know that it would probably be better for me in the long term to cut her off but right now it isn’t realistic. While I have a wonderful boyfriend whose flat I can stay at whenever if anything was to happen I would essentially be homeless for the next 2 summers. I owe her money which I fully intend to pay back and because I miss my dad immensely and while I probably wouldn’t, I fear I would feel an immense amount of guilt when she died if I did.

Just to add although it really is a side thought. When my dad died there was a lump sum and his pension, both go to her but he explicitly stated that he wanted me to have the lump sum in time for a deposit for a house.

The other month my boyfriend who works in finance was kind enough to rejig all the finances and spread is over a number of funds. She thanked him and said "This is all I am going to have for retirement." I find this odd because she will be getting her state pension, her own and my dads and has no mortgage. But what really fucks me off is she hasn't even mentioned about potentially using this money to me, now if she is going to need it to live off I don't care, she can have it.. But to not even ask if she can have the money my dad said to both of us he wanted me to have I find a really bitch move.
If you can't cut her out then I would limit contact as much as you can. It seems like a horrible situation to be in. It sounds like she has a lot to work on and if she isn't willing you twould are never going to get along.
Ok, so my family has been controlling in my life for a number of years, and I take part of the responsibility...I let them. Enter an amazing new man in my life whom my family does not like. They basically tell me everything bad they can think of (some they even make up) in an effort to get me to break up with him. When I stand up to them (a first for me) I get radio silence. My father even said, and I quote: "I told you how I felt and it changed nothing." 
After that conversation I saw them once on my niece's birthday and didn't hear from them for 3 months (we used to talk on a weekly basis). 

Recently they reached out and invited me to Thanksgiving - I was touched. Upon advice from my therapists to put family and friends on the shelf right now, for a brief period of time, to concentrate on my own mental health (coming back from depression) I came to the decision that being around my family is not in my best interest right now -- mental health wise. Going to their house means bickering, snide remarks, gossip, tension...just general yuckiness and I'm always in a bad mood for days afterwards. 

I thanked them for the invite but declined and offered that we meet up in the upcoming weeks for dinner -- somewhere between their house and mine. Their response...no. When I asked why (I believe I caught my mother off guard) I was initially told that it was too difficult to pick a date to meet up. That was then quickly changed to the fact that it is too far for them to drive and then sit through a dinner (although they are able to make a Thanksgiving meal for 5 and entertain family over the weekend without difficulty).

I've come to realize that the family that I thought I had - people who cared about me and supported me, doesn't really exist. I've also come to realize that they aren't that good for me and are sending me a clear message that they really don't want anything to do with me unless it is on their terms - something I'm not willing to do anymore. I'm trying to work with them, find compromises, but they aren't willing to work with me. 

I'm really not sure where to go from here. I don't want to give up and cut my family out of my life, but I can't keep putting myself out there to be hurt every time.

** My boyfriend wants nothing to do with my family. He's been to family functions, we've had them over here, but he's said he cannot be a part of anything where he stands by and watches me continually get hurt. He's tried to step in and it has made things worse -- gives my family more fodder to hate him.

Help??!!

TL;DR: My family is controlling, doesn't like my boyfriend, treating me badly, what do I do? 
It sounds like your therapist is giving you good advice. They may be family, but that doesn't make them good people. If they refuse to spend time with them it is best to not go out of your way for them. Sometimes distance isn't a bad thing.
Thanks - you've summed it up well. I have a gut feeling that this is the way that my relationship is going to be with my family from now on. I keep waffling between: "But I want it to be better" and "Screw them! If they don't want to spend time with me, I don't want to spend time with them!"
My boyfriend and his family are amazing and have really taken me in. I guess I need to count my blessings and recognize what I already have instead of wanting something that likely won't be.
Their loss.

That is ridiculous! I would keep cooking and look for a new place to live.
Seriously! I'll be out in 6 months, thank God.
My older sister and I are 10 years apart. She acts as though she ALWAYS knows better than me because she's older and a mom. If I try to make plans with her she waits until the last minute to give me an answer, which is usually a no, unless it benefits her like me babysitting. My boyfriend says I should stop being her impromtu babysitter. I recently tried to schedule a sleepover with her oldest (10),  and it took her four days to even bring it up with her husband. Anytime I asked her if she had talked to him yet, she ignored me. The answer was no. When I brought the sleepover up in the first place she said it was fine. This is hardly the first time an incident like this has happened. Anytime my I talk about future plans my bf and I have, such as children, she immediately says we're not ready. I was her live-in nanny for almost three years. Any advice on how to not scream at her?
I would stop spending time with her and being her nanny. She is being selfish and is a taker. You don't need that in your life.
I stopped being her nanny two years ago, and I barely see her because of the distance. (Almost 2 hr drive)
I never thought I would be the person with a 'long lost family' story. My mother and father are still happily married. I know both sides of the families well. My cousins are like siblings. However, a couple of moths ago my uncle 'M' informed me I had a cousin I didn't know about, and she reached out to him. Today, I met her, her mother and stepdad. My entire life my family has been so tight knit that I had no idea. I never thought I would be a person with a long lost family story. She brought an album of pictures documenting her life for us. She and I are doppelgängers. I have never hugged someone so tight. I've never loved someone I haven't ever met (other than my son) until now. My mind is blown but I'm filled with love and happiness. She's my family. Always. Her father, my uncle 'g' is dead. He died when I was 16.  So glad that she has us, even though she never had him. She also has a badass mom and step dad we welcome with open arms as family. Holy shit. Be still, my heart. 
That is awesome! It is great that you have found each other.
So the back story about 3 days ago me, my sister and my nephew was leaving his football game and we were all going back to his mom's house but I drove my own car and he wanted to ride with me. My sister said that it was because I was the cool aunt. I laughed and said only by default cause there aren't anymore siblings to be aunts or uncles. She said it's easy being cool when you don't have to discipline . We then got in the car and on tge way I asked do you think your mom is cool? He said No. I asked  why? cause I was surprised he said no. He said because she doesn't wear cool clothes and she doesn't act cool. When he said that my feelings were hurt a little even though he wasnt talking about me. 

Back story on my sister so my sister is 27 and has a bad weight issue she's also a new graduate from her university's social work program but she hasn't found a job yet and she lives in government assistant housing for the time being but I'm starting to feel like she's not looking for a job as hard as she could be. See a few days prior my firend from high school got promoted and is managing a few dollar stores in our area and she asked me when i saw her if i needed a job. I told my sister about it but she didnt want it but i dont understand if you cant find a job in your field right now why not work somewhere  so you can buy yourself the essentials and not freeload off our dad who's buying you everything that foodstamps and the occasional child's support check isn't buying. My dad is enabling this behavior i asked him he said hes doing it for my nephew. Which i cant argue with but as long as she has free housing food and you paying her car insurance why change? (I must add I'm a little salty cause I'm 20 and I'm working my ass off to finish the nursing program and work and pay my car insurance and other bills and she sits on her ass and gets her bills paid by our dad who refuses to help me) I want to move out but I can't. 

I love my sister and I tried in the past to talk to her about ways to spice it up some and I told her you can be fat and pretty!  Like don't throw in the towel I want to tell my sister how my nephew feels because maybe it would wake her up to changing and trying to get a job but I don't want to tell her and she might  just get sad and then still can't find a job to make the necessary changes. I also told my nephew I wouldn't tell her cause he thinks she'll be mad and hurt her feelings I don't know what I should do cause she needs to change.
Most kids don't think of their parents as cool and as a general rule Aunts/Uncle/Grandparents can be more fun as they don't usually discipline the kid.


It's hard to really talk about your sister without knowing a full background of her life. However, what you have said:  she's overweight and lives in poverty. Two very depressing things. Being overweight by itself can be a sign that someone is dealing with some internal issues that are not easy to resolve.


It sounds like your sister could use some professional counseling. Maybe your dad can invest money into that so that your sister can start taking care of herself and her son. Rather than simply paying a bill to maintain the status quo.
Of course your nephew doesn't think his mom is cool. Most kids don't once they pass a certain age. Kids need rules and boundaries, but it doesn't mean they like them. It sounds like your sister is in a shitty situation and depressed. You sound like you are a bit more realistic and resilent. Keep being there for your nephew. Back up your sister when you can. Be the truth for your nephew because he is more likely to listen to what you say.
So what can I do to change the situation? Should I tell her about my nephew? What can I do to help her? My nephew all I can do is motivate him to not follow in her unhealthy habits. My dad isn't really in a good place to help any of us considering he got laid off from his job due to the company closing. He found work a few months later but the pay is terrible he's making like a 1/3 less than what he's been making and he's struggling to pay his essential bills but he said hes paying my sister car insurance because she has to take my nephew to school and stuff and she wouldn't have a way so he couldn't do that and pay for counseling ( also she wouldn't even admit to needing it in the first place) but in dec. He has to start paying back her loan because he got a parent plus loan and he's deferred it all he can but the thing is if she hasn't found a job and he can't pay it then I can't finish school so I have to hope he can pay it or I'll have to pay back her loans until I finish just so he won't go into default. I just keeping getting fucked ass by all of this. I know I deviated far from the topic at hand I just needed to rant. But should I tell her or just leave it and be the listening ear to my 7 year old nephew? 
I feel like telling your sister would cause her more pain and stress. It would also betray your nephew's trust and minimize the chances of him coming to you about things in the future. 

I think you should provide more support to both of them. Take her for a sister date to the salon or shopping and help her pick out something flattering and gift it to her. It will help reduce her other stresses, build her confidence, and help her start doing it on her own. Provide your nephew with examples of how to love her anyways and things he can do to help reduce her stresses as well. Make sure he knows how much your sister loves him and does for him. 

They are lucky to have someone who loves them and wants to help!
yesterday there was this school meetup, like a party and my mum bought me clothes and a pack of makeup things. I've never worn makeup but she has said i need make-up, or i'll get no boys because of my spots. 
Spots on my face never really bother me only on occasion and i'm aware people aren't attracted to girls with spots. She said , you either wear makeup and the clothes i got for you or you are not going, after a bit of argument, she threw the make-up bag on the floor and stormed ino another room. I wore the clothes, but i wore a hooded jumper and ziped it up because  it was a low v neck, and i dislike those. She's driving me crazy, because  i'm 15 and i have had 2 bf in the past, ex now not because of me being 'ugly', but because we wanted different things, she doesn't know this because she'll then moan for me having a boyfriend.
She wears alot when we go out, but never if she's working on the farm, but that's not an issue i think. What do i do, because for a while now she's been saying stuff like 'what if you have a boyfriend, he wouldn't like someone with your weight and spots' and she hardly ever lets me choose my own clothing without a fight.
Should i just give in or what? every one else wears makeup or have natual nice skin.
You don't have to wear make up. Plenty of women don't. I rarely wear it. It is all about what you are comfortable with. Don't let your mom project her insecurities unto you.
Tell her to mind her own business. Your body, your decision.
You don't need make up.

I'm sure your mother is trying to do what's best for you in HER mind, but sadly she is another sheeple, who thanks to media, believes that women need a certain style, makeup usage, butt and breast size to be deemed as beautiful by others.

She is lost in that subconscious belief. But your not, and I wouldn't jump on the bandwagon to please others, which isn't honestly necessary.

Seriously, you don't need it.

And this is a guy saying this, btw. Personally belief has always been that make up only hides that which makes you unique, and people are dumb enough to call "flaws."
Seriously, my family thinks I am way more lazy than I actually am. They just use that word to label me all willy nilly and its so annoying.. its because I dont help them but like... nobody ever asks for help??? They say I get cranky if they do but only because of how they ask. My family never says please or thank you and constantly order me around instead of asking if I would please. 
How old are you? When you say family ordering you around do you mean your parents? 
If you're 19 and living with your grandparents, they shouldn't have to ask for your help. You should be making an effort to help out around the house. Perhaps if you made the effort to do so in a regular basis, you might find they say thank you. But it really is just common decency for you to help out without having to be asked or reminded. 
Im 19. And no I dont mean my parents. My dad couldnt give a shit about me. Its my grandmother that I live with and my other grandparents that I am visiting. 
This evening, ten minutes ago actually, dad came home from work. Considering that he's depressive controlling moody egomaniac (my own diagnosis) it's a time for tremors. What I mean saying "tremors"? I mean anxiety, fear, cold hands and many other unpleasant things. One evening he is a nice human being who gives a damn about other people, another evening he is aggressive (sometimes drunk), snide, sarcastic, hurtful bitch who won't stop terrorising us in our own home, treating us like we are his enemies.
Okay so, mom went to the kitchen with him and from my room I can hear raised agitated voices. Apparently grandma is coming this October for a visit. **For an indefinite period of time.** Without asking if it's alright, if we actually may afford it (because dad lost his job. He found out today. He has time to find new one until the end of this month.) Mom's a pensioner due to her health issues and I am currently unemployed too... Here we go! Why money is an issue? Because grandmother (like many relatives from both mom's and dad's sides) has illusions of grandeur. *Only rich people live a in city.* Moreover, they believe that since we live in a capital, it's *"raining money".* Guys, we live in a flat. Which has tiny hall, bathroom, toilet-room and one room which is a bedroom for my parents, for me, living room, guest room and working place. Old wardrobe is the only thing which separates the main body and my "room" since I entered puberty. That's it. 
When I was a child she and my uncle (and many other relatives) visited us and usually stayed for a season (usually summer) or a year or five years. *(Because we don't need privacy, money grows on trees and our flat is apparently a tent from Harry Potter).* Again, when I was a kid, I didn't take much space but now there are three adults and in the near future I must leave because it's time (I am 23 and father and I both are stubborn and don't see eye to eye considering many things). 
Next problem is practical too. We live in an old building which means it's cold (I live in Russia, meaning cold windy autumns and cold freezing winters). And it's not a joke. I am sitting in the kitchen and freezing because the wind is dancing waltz here. Where are we going to put her to sleep? On the floor? Because there is my couch and parents' bed/lounch. Okay, they'll put her on their bed. Mom'll sleep on the floor in the same room. And dad goes to sleep in the kitchen. 
Third, again, it's money. We are middle class who can afford a fancy purchase once in 3-5 years. Because a lion's share of money all this little family's life went to relatives on both sides. And grandmother last time she visited was really "upset with us" because she wanted to visit lots of places and see a "good doctor". Last time I went to fancy place was in school, okay? And I haven't seen a doctor since I finished school. Because it all needs MONEY. My parents went into debts to pay for my education. And I was working as a tutor with dreams of saving enough money to see a dentist because my teeth are shit. My eyesight is shit. My parents have health issues, to remedy that, they need money. To make repairs in the flat we need money. But grandma doesn't care. She already bought tickets. My parents are constantly fighting. But grandma doesn't care. She wants to visit. I am losing respect for my father because of underhanded things he's done, for things he said, because hurting people is his entertainment, because he said shit to me when I was depressed, because he bulled and targeted mom with his insults and aggression. Because I don't want my family to fall apart. But grandmother doesn't care. She wants to visit. Because our home is not our home, it's a hotel. Because she doesn't respect my mother and never did. Because she wants "her baby" to be happy and she is his family and we are, I guess, some vermin? I don't know. I just looked at my defeated mother and felt rage. I still do. Because they bullied (grandmother and father's sisters) and belittled mother and, now I realise with horror, that they manipulated me and used me as a tool against mom. And now that woman comes into our home again, without invitation, without warning, for what? What does she want? during her last visit she showed her true face (or maybe I was dumb and naive before) she never does anything without having some agenda. Her last visit ended with talks about arranging marriage (dad's family is  veryyy patriarchal) and my cancelled education in Germany (no MA in Linguistics for me). But it all doesn't actually matter. What matters is that  this woman encroaches on ourterritory, sets my parents against each other, drains life force from my mom like a vampire. 
I have a gut feeling that this visit won't end good for my family. Either she'll try to dominate my mother and I'll snap, then father will to tell me to shut up, and then I'll snap at him... Snapping all around. And I don't want to stand between my parents. I believe, I want to believe that whatever this bump in their relationship is, they'll manage it and come out as a united front. But I am preparing myself for the worst. I never said it outloud or admited it even to myself, but since I was 13 I was thinking that divorce is the best route for them and couldn't and can't stop feeling guilty over it. What if I'll be a cause of it? Because I am not going to sit idly while someone tries to talk shit at my mother. Fight me, bitches. 
And the last thing that pisses me off. I understand that father is like between two fires but we are his family too, this is his family, no one gets to talk shit to or at them, even if they are your friends/relatives. No. Just no. She is his mother but she must learn to mind her own business. It's not like he's blind or stupid or deaf! He must know that they constantly attacking us but nooooooo.  Some time ago, he had guts to say to my mother that she manipulted me against his family(which we apparently are not) and puts seeds of hate in me. Ha! My mother is the least manipulative person you can find. She is blunt and straightforward and if she doesn't like you, you will sure as hell know it. 
God, I don't know why I wrote this. I guess I needed to rant. To take it off my chest because I can't burden my friend anymore with this and worry them. Maybe someone will give me an advice how to handle it. Well, the only way I see is to quickly find a job so I'd spend less time at home but what about mom? Leaving mom and that woman alone in little flat is like putting lioness and snake in a cage (Griffindor vs Slytherin). 
What I am even talking about, this announcement really messed me up. Sorry for the rant. I might come later (when I cool down) to edit it because it's like a vomit of words and anger.
To summarize:
1. Grandma comes to vist without warning
2. Dad takes his mother's side (as always)
3. Possibly she wants to talk to my dad about marrying me off (it's not first time)
4. Grandma doesn't respect my mother
5. Mom is exhausted and needs relaxation ASAP not relatives-raid
6. Need advice how to handle this situation and help mom
Sounds like you should get a job and get out of there if you can. How old are you? You would be much, much better off in a better environment! 
Thank you for your advice! I am 23 and currently looking for a job as it's really the only option in this situation: not only I'll spend less time at home but I'll be on my way to become financially independant. The only issue that worries is my mom. I can't help but feel like I am abandoning her to deal with this situation alone day in day out for an indefinite period of time and the guilt is crippling me and my attempts at "becoming an goddamn adult".  :( Even though mom is all about me living my own life. It's just grandmother is such a sneaky and toxic person who tries to destroy my parents' relationship with her cheap manipulations :(
Sorry if this gets lengthy. 
My sister who's 26 and mildly mentally challenged lives with my dad still. My mother moved out during an ugly divorce but was unable to get a place large enough for her to come with her. My sister is usually involved in a lot of activities anyways so she didn't mind too much. Since the divorce my dad became a major asshole. Idk maybe I'm biased. But him and my sister got into a verbal altercation that turned physical and he put his hands on her. She ended up with bruises and scraped knees from being dragged out of the house. He threw her vanity bench across her room and yelled and screamed at her. She calls the police and files second degree assault charges. His initial statement to the police was to the effect of we just had an argument nothing happened. Now a week later he filed second degree assault charges against her. A 90lb mentally challenged girl. I don't know what he's claiming.   I feel terrible for her and angry at him. He always has been a bully while we were growing up... he was rough but nothing I would consider abusive. I am ready to cut him out of my life and my daughters life. She's his first grandchild. I want him to feel how he makes us feel. I don't know if I'm venting or want an outside opinion. I really want to show up to court and scream I hate him. I don't know. I'm so done with him being a part of our lives, my brother still lives with him and the only one on his side and I don't want to ruin my relationship with my brother. I'm at a loss of what to do.
Clearly your father has issues and he is likely to get in a lot of trouble for this. He could be going to jail or prison, and really, he should. I would absolutely cut him out of your life and your daughter's life. He sounds violent and unstable and not someone who should be around kid's. Where I'd your sister now? Is she safe? I would see if she has a lawyer. If not, help her get one. Don't go to court to yell your hatred at your father, but do go and testify as a character witness for your sister and against your father. He deserves to be locked up for this.
My sister is safe, she's staying at my apartment and my mom's apartment. She's on the couches but she's safe. He's not stable. We are looking at this volunteer service of lawyers to help those with  low incomes.  I do plan on going to the court hearing. Thank you very much. 
I am so sorry this is happening to you and your sister. It is absolutely horrible. I hope things turn out well.
So I haven't seen or really spoken to my father for 7 almost 8 years. I have seen him twice once at my grandmas house and second when he got into a motorcycle accident almost a year ago. I have sent him letters and text messages but I don't get a response. I don't know if I should even bother sending him one, But I do want to show him I did it without him.
Send it him as long as you're not bothered about a response. If it's just a case of showing your dad how well you've done without him then go for it. If deep down your hoping for some kind of reaction, apology or whatever then let it go. 

I didn't / don't see my dad much and it can really mess with your emotions so I get why you'd want to do this. 
I'm sorry, but no, I wouldn't send anything. If you have seen him twice in your life and doesn't respond to attempts at communicating then he doesn't want to hear from you, and likewise you shouldn't want to hear from someone who can't be a Dad.
There are two types of regrets:  Regretting doing something / Regretting not doing something.


When the thought is to be inflict pain on someone else, the latter is the best regret to have.  


My father abandoned his responsibilities. I am a father now myself.  Every now and again I think about how much of a horrible person he is, and then I turn that thought to how much better I am. I don't spend my time hating him, but when a negative thoughts enter my mind I shovel them into the mental furnace that is my ambition and drive to improve myself.


"There goes Midnightscares. Did you know her father abandoned her? She went out and achieved anyways. I admire her."
Same here, although in the past couple years I've managed to have somewhat of a relationship with my father.

Send it. The worst case scenario is that he doesn't reply or show up, the middle scenario is him sending you money (customary for graduation invites) and the best case is that he actually shows.
So I'm just wondering if this is a common thing. My girlfriend (27) has sleepovers with her niece (10) on a fairly regular basis. I don't think it's creepy or anything, I've just never heard of that type of relationship and I don't really understand it. The whole thing is entirely innocent (they draw, play games, etc.), but it always happens at her niece's house while the parents (my gf's sister and brother-in-law) are there. The parents will usually make the most of the night and go out for dinner, but they always come back and sleep in the house. 

Everything makes sense to me until the point where the niece will get upset if her aunt leaves at the end of the night instead of sleeping in the room with her. Does anyone else do this? Is it considered a healthy relationship between an aunt and her niece? Just looking for opinions because her and I somewhat disagree. I would completely understand if her niece came to her house for the night, but having a sleepover at her nieces house is just a bit odd to me.
I'm (28f) pretty close with my nephew's (3 &16) and they feel the same way about me leaving. Granted I don't live in the same city so I get to visit about 4x/year and I stay at a friend's house most of the time but they get upset if I don't spend at least one night at their place.  I dunno I think it's totally fine, girls tend to have lots of sleepovers with each other growing up. Maybe she enjoys the one on one attention that she gets from your gf? Or she gets to do different things with her then with her parents?
I have 5 of my own kiddos. But when my sister's kids come over (I have 6 nieces and nephews)  I have 8 kiddos. They're mine while they're with me. They'll also in my bed. I'll hold them the way your mama holds on to you. I'm the cool crafty crazy Auntie. Next year I'll be sending my oldest son's to live with one of my sister's for a year of school (like our own student exchange program) on Florida's space coast (they have great school in that area that focus on spacer exploration).  But that's just how we do it. We trade kids a few times a year if we can. But we aren't normal. My sister's and I grew up overseas and are what is called Third culture Kids. And even though we're back state side we want our children to experience a very full life. Filled with so much love. Anyway, I'm my opinion, there is no such thing as too much love given innocently and freely to a child.  If sleeping over is what's normal for that family, that's okay. Things don't always have to be so cookie cutter. :)
My sister has come over and spent the night more than once. She wasn't sleeping in the same room, but they like her being there because it means playing with their aunt the next day too. Nothing wrong with that.
If my sister tried to sleep over, she'd probably try to sleep in my bed..... Put her cold ass feet on me and fart on my back.
I wasn't suppose to do this, but the man did drugs away from the house and was never high around his child. I didn't report it
That isn't fair to the kid. I understand the system can be unforgiving, but if this parent is doing drugs he can be making other bad decision. Maybe he doesn't. The only way to know is an investigation. You need to report it.
Are you looking for advice or absolution?
ok so lately I'm always depended on as a babysitter like really . I go to college and I  can't stay after to get help  on my assignments ,or tutoring session because my parents expect me to come straight home ON TIME ( I take the city bus so it varies 3:45PM-4:00PM) and my school is an hour away from home.My dad keeps expecting me to be home for him to drop my little brother off at 3PM and I keep telling him I won't be home on time for that because of the city bus  and HE GOT MAD AT ME !!!!  like wtf .  My whole life I had no down time to myself. I never stayed after school to hang out with my friends because I have to come home and babysit . I can never go out like on dates because My mom would have an attitude about it and would expect me to stay home and AGAIN babysit while she and my dad do their thing. Guess what I HAVE AN  OLDER BROTHER  who is a YEAR OLDER THAN ME !!! , and they never put that pressure on him and lets him do whatever he wants to do. and oh did I mention I work 6 or 8 hours Friday Through Sunday and then Tuesday, Wednesday,Thursday I have school and Monday and Friday I have off and my little brother goes to kindergarten but.... I have to stay home for them to drop him off early .  and they have a FREE after school program for him to  do but no they expect me to babysit. I just want some freedom like I never been on a date ( and I have a bf ) because my parents are strict and want me to babysit every day and work and school and that's it . I never been able to go out with friends because I'm stuck babysitting or my parents would just give me a dirty look and start an argument questioning why I want to go out.I just want to move out like REALLY want to leave so I won't feel like a prisoner. I only make $10 an hour and I don't know if that's enough to live on my own. Please give me advice on what to do. I am scared to talk to them about it because every time I do it's always an NO and an argument and they win .(sorry for the bad spelling.) 
If they are paying for school you are in a tough place. If they are not paying for school then it is easier. You are an adult now and while you don't mind helping out you are not a babysitter and have other obligations. Don't ask to go out.   I know it is hard, but sit down and tell them you are in college now and will be living your own adult life. You will be participating in school programs and working and they will have to make arrangements for your sibling. If they push back just tell them that you have other obligations now and that they will have to make do. If they want you to pay some rent, that may be a compromise. 

For now, save every penny that you can. See what housing is available either through the school or off campus. You will likely need a roommate to be able to afford a place and that is okay. It is absolutely not reason to expect you to be a caregiver to your brother. Stay away from suggestion your older brother as a babysitter. It isn't about what anyone else is doing or not doing. This is about you not being willing and able to do it. What they choose to do is on them, but it is their responsibility to arrange care for your brother. Best of luck.
Thank you and I am paying for my schooling.I think I am going to sit down and have a chat with them , because I want to enjoy my life in college and be involved more , and I do have a bf now and I want to spend a lot of time with him instead of him dumping me because I can never leave the house.
So my father threw me under the bus twice today being the second time.

The last time he set me up with someone that resulted in an heated argument between me and the other person and later my father told me that I shouldnt have done that while he told me to go talk to him in the first place.

Today he told me to go buy a cover for a new phone he got for someone which I felt he bought for himself so I set out to buy the cover from a reputed a place thats far from my house,and at the same time my mother came home and was locked outside without keys.She called my father and told him to call me because I couldnt take the call while riding the bike.So on return from the trip to buy the cover my mother asked him why he send me to out to buy it he said "He shouldnt have gone there to buy the cover" instead of asking my mother why she didnt carry her keys.

So I pretty much do the work he wants but he keeps pushing the blame on me when things dont work out.I dont know if this is narcissism or what would love if you guys would help me out.
Hello Reddit, I have a very urgent question - what should I do? 
I'm 18 years Old, my brother is 24, we are from the Czech Republic. He is a step-son to my father. 
My father is ... "Abusive".. He is a good Guy only when He isn't drunk, the problem is though - He is drunk 5 days in the week. He treats my nice, since I do everything He commands ( If I didn't, He would be so fucking mad... That's why I say ""abusive"). He has fights with my mother pretty often, most of the time due to my bro. I love my brother more than anyone, He would do everything for me and vica versa. My father always say "fucking faggot, dickhead, etc. Silently behind his Back, constaintly complains on him, but my bro haven't Done anything bad to him - ever... 

Until today though, my father was only talking, but today, they fought eachother. Me and my mom broke Them off. 
My bro would love to beat the shi* out of him, due to being abused so much, but He can't, since my father is the house owner And He would probably call cops And shit like a coward. After that He Said "Now we are in war you son of a bitch" And went to his room.

I don't know what to do, we Will probably move out of this house, but until that?:x

(Sorry if some sentences doesn't make much sense, I'm stressed right Now, the fight happened like 15 mins ago...) 

TL;dr : my brother, which I really love, is being constsantly attacked with words by my "abusive" but today it went to the extreme And they almost killed eachother... How can I help him ?:/
You can't do anything about the relationship that they have. You can support your brother emotionally, but that is about it. Sorry.
Maybe you can rush things (save as much money as you are able to) so you can move out from your house with your brother as soon as possible. I think moving out is your only option here since it seems like your father and your brother cannot live together.. So sorry for you mate, stay strong and supportive to your brother and you'll see how things get better! 
Ye, thought so too :/...
my partner told me he was helping a friend (female) from suicide attempt and it made me jealous as i attempted days ago and daily struggle with (not that he knows this) and felt that if someone was going to do they wouldnt be running around telling everyone and would just do it. I feel its attention seeking. I know i sound cruel but i felt jealous that he went and sent someone to check on her as i know i dont have anyone. I make out to the very few people i do talk to that i saw and see people to give the impression i am not severely lonely. I have a serious problem trusting people so keep a bubble around myself and often feel detacthed and constant state of convincing myself not to finish it. I have two kids and even that doesnt convince me.....I also struggle to let them socialise as i have severe trust issues and anxiety and find people irritable - I know i myself may be irritable to people also but this is the catch 22. I wish i had someone trustworthy i could talk to but i dont trust anyone. I read this post back and i know I sound so wicked Lord forgive me but as i said i feel jealous that he went and told her mum and i felt jealous. Maybe because mine isnt interested in me and stayed with the man who abused me. It burns me - I never told anyone of my attempt and attempts and so dont understand why somehow i am sat here feeling jealous that she was able to share something so personal such as suicide to so many people and had the support of being convinced to not do it. Please please forgive me i know i am thinking wicked but does anyone else know what i mean?
You really need to get to a therapist. You see your own struggles as real and others as attention seeking. You are jealous that your partner is trying to stop someone else from ending her life and mad at him for not noticing your struggle when you refuse to let him in. You have put him in a no win situation. He either doesn't notice and isn't attentive enough or he playing an angle. I don't mean this to.sound mean, but you really need help to deal with these issues.  If you  are considering harming yourself please, get help. Here is a place you can call.

I havent been bothering with my problems as he is in jail so figure he got his own stuff to deal with. I just felt wow look how comfortable she felt to share with him he personal struggles.

I am due to start therapy soon and hopefully get put some stuff to rest but i dont even have the support when i bring up some past things - looked up advice on therapy and it advises support outside the therapist as it seems people get susceptible to backsliding emotionally as they unwrap layers of their mental state. I have no one but myself i find myself talking to myself outloud about my problems and offer myself the advice back as if someone elses viewpoint. I pretend to be jokey to the few people who i do talk to (3 people) i am lucky to speak to once a month and i have to chase them as they are busy working. I am dying inside it feels like i am not here and i have to stab myself to remind myself i am here, I worry about getting help as i know they would take my kids off me if i was to share with therapist how i truly felt. Not that i would ever harm them but honestly i worry what would happen to them if i wasnt here and then start thinking i would have to take them with me so now in my head i just think when they are older and can fend for selves that would be less selfish.  
I understand your concern. I suffer from depression and anxiety and have two young kids. It makes me fight extra hard because they are my world. The problem is it sounds like you refuse to let anyone in and are so worried about other people being toxic that you can't see your behavior as toxic. People can't be there for you if you don't let them and people will only stuck around so long when you make them feel like they are not wanted. Yes, it is great that this woman was comfortable sharing her attempt, but that doesn't make her an attention seeker. She did something drastic, got scared and asked for help. That isn't a bad thing. It is a good thing and can help her with recovery. 

The truth is you need to be honest with your therapist. I understand your fears, but you are not going to get better if you don't get treatment and they can't effectively treat you. Your kids deserve a healthy mom. If you won't do it for you then do it for them.
I feel guilty because my mom lives paycheck to paycheck and I have a substantial savings.

My mom is somewhat of a proud woman, she won't ask for help unless she absolutely needs to.
She grew up poor, almost all of her adult years was poor. She's only ever had herself (besides my dad, who she left when I was 5), never dates or has friends.

I'm not sure what to do, the more I think about It the more guilty I feel. This woman raised me and my siblings working her ass off and now she can barely afford a pot to piss in.
I've given her help over the years, I've loaned her money that I've eventually forgive. Probably between 2 and 4 thousand dollars. Bought groceries, dinners...
On one hand I want to give her more money to help but on the hand I want to buy house soon and not have to worry about what's in my bank account.

She isn't book smart, she had her CDL class a license for a while but she says it's too much work for her to drive trucks now (plus she doesn't want to deal with the nasty men in that profession anymore)
She's also had her nurses aid certificate or license but long since expired.

Does anyone have any advice on the best way to help her for the long ten?


Some people will always be paycheck to paycheck no matter how much money they bring in.  Some people will always save a bit no matter how little they make.

I'm the latter, my DH and his mom are both the former.  Fortunately he recognizes this and lets me handle all our finances.  We help his mom out here and there, but we don't rob Peter to pay Paul - long term her best hope is us being stable enough to help her along.  I expect that someday she'll end up living with us - which I don't mind cause she's a lovely lady and wonderful with her grandkids, just not good with money.
5 years ago I lost my dad to colon cancer. Ever since my family has been a little, well, just different. I wouldn't say we're fucked up, but we all had to cope with losing dad in our own ways. Mom started gardening, my brother ate his emotions, and my sister could barely leave the house out of fear of some kind of harm. She's better now, but still pretty paranoid. And then me? I drank and smoked and just ran from the feelings. 

My dads death was the start of me losing my "faith." I have flashbacks of me screaming bloody murder at God wondering why he took my dad away... I was so certain that God wasn't going to take him yet. So much time spent praying and feeling that everything was going to be ok. I'm now healthy and happy, living my life as a sort of agnostic Christian bhuddist. But my family cannot accept me for who I am now. I don't want them to change their faith or morals because of me, I just want them to be there for me. Fuck, not even there for me... I want to be excited with them and for them and enjoy each other's company like we used to. 

I'm about to get married, and I can't even tell them how excited I am. 

I understand their beliefs can lead them to pushing "people like me" away... I've been there... I was hardcore Christian for many years. I understand where they're coming from but it doesn't make it easy for me to not be saddened when I don't get invited to my own mother's birthday. Not to mention how hard it is to figure out how to move on and not let this eat at me. 

My mom's bday is tomorrow. No one told me they had made plans... So I shoot out a group text the fam asking what's going on and my sister responds with "We r having mom up here for dinner one night. It's just too much to get all our schedules lined up and Sally (her daughter) has to get to bed earlier with school."

I wanted to respond with "you could have at least tried." 

I'm just sad and looking for comfort in the fact that I'm not the only one who has "left their religion" and lost their family in the process. There are obviously many more details to this story but whatever, you can ask if you'd like to know. If anyone knows how to cope well with this, how to let go and move on, lemme know. For now I'm going to keep meditating and telling myself it's not worth the emotional pain, that I do not need them, and that I did all I could to mend the breaks. 
Pentecostal?
Its very hard to realize whats really going on, that's the hard truth man, its not about the family anymore its about the group of people having some kind of bond that keep the connection alive, ounce that bond is broke the connection is automatically broken too. I've seen this behavior before. I don't know what kind of advice i can share but what you can do is invite them to outings from your side, keep the connection alive from your part... Don't wait them to call you, call them instead.
I am sorry you are going through this. There is no easy answer. You can keep trying with them. Keep inviting them into your life. Or you can decide that you don't want them in your life and find people who accept and love you for who you areally.

The reality is you aren't going to change their mind, which you seem to already accept. What you have to decide is if these are people who will associate with you without sharing their beliefs? Or do they believe that they can't associate with someone who has different beliefs? I don't know them so I can't answer that for you. What I can say is that you have every right to believe what you do and it is sad they would use that against you. I understand being saddened by having different beliefs, but it shouldn't be a game ender. But that is my view.

All I can say is I am a Catholic (well, lapsed Catholic) who married and atheist. My family loves him. My mom does wish he would believe and I have shut her down when she starts in on her "deep down he must believe" talks because I love my husband for who he is. I ask if she thinks he is a good man, husband and father. She says yes and I tell her that is all she needs to know. My family was always very tolerant and always taught me that all people deserved love. There was never any issues with gay people or divorce or anything like that. They never had issues with people of different faiths. So in terms of Catholics they are extremely liberal  (but in terms of politics still conservative). I don't know how things would be different if they couldn't accept my relationship with my husband or me. I can say that I would have a hard time with people who were supposed to love me shunning me because I didn't fit their mold, but again, that is me.

Only you can know what you are comfortable doing.
First off, thank you for taking the time to respond. I don't have many people around me, that I know of, who have struggled with this. 

My family is all different. I really am only close to my mom, brother, and sister (she's married and has a little girl). At this point the struggle is just with my sister. She's a good bit older than me and could not be more opposite. We literally cannot agree on anything, have very little in common, and what we do have in common is so petty we can't sustain a meaningful conversation. 

My mom mentioned to me once she has always been a little jealous of me, but my sister says the opposite. We tried going to counseling but it wasn't productive and neither of us really made much effort to try again. It's been so long now I don't know why we stopped going together. I think we just lost hope. 

She said that it's hard for her to not see me as 15 still, I'm now in my late 20's. 

I have come to terms with the fact that we may never agree and may never be close again. The hard part about it for me is that I will be getting married soon... I want to share this with her, and I will... When we actually get engaged. Also having lost my dad made me realize how fragile life is. I don't want to die or have a loved one die without at least having tried to make things ok between us (given there's a riff). 
oh man, I feel ya.  I grew up mormon, but left a few years ago.  My parents, in-laws, and sister have all grown very distant.  My sister and I were especially very close.  It has been hard and hurts a lot.  But the more I focus on that loss the worse it is.  I find that when I spend more time with the family and friends that still want to be with me, it makes me feel better.  I can't change people not wanting anything to do with me.  I finally realized it's them, not me. I still reach out sometimes, but I mostly do my own thing and have moved on.  It never really gets easier, but I try to not dwell on it as much.  I'm so sorry you have to go through it also :( 
Then don't 
I feel your pain. I feel as if I'm losing my family right now over other life choices, and it's incredibly painful. I've been just reading through the /r/family subreddit for support. 
No, non-denominational technically. We/they were really into Christian apologetics... Following a lot of men like Norman Geisler and Frank Turek. 
You're right. That was literally the underlying thing for all of us. It was what we based all our decisions on. And yes, I should continue to share with them and invite them regardless. Thank you friend. 
When I was very young (2-3ish), my parents divorced.  I lived with my mother until I was about 5.  Apparently her being a single mother was interfering with her life, so she decided to set the reset button, and sent me off to live with my dad.  Since that point, I think I only had two interactions with her (once about 8, once about 10).  Since she started over, she remarried, and had two other children.  I don't think either of them know anything about me.  I've tried to reach out to her a couple of times, with no response.  That's fine, I've written her off anyway, and my life is fine w/out her.  I would be interested in communicating or finding out more about my half siblings, though.  I know how to get in touch with one of them.  But I wonder if I try to reach out to him if that would just be interfering in his life and bringing up things he doesn't need to deal with.
Better to do it now and encounter any hostility than not do it and wish you had later in life. You have more to gain in this than to lose.
I've have nothing against religion directly, except Scientology but that's on it's way to oblivion. A lot really good people come out of it regardless if it's considered a dated concept, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have it's faults.
My mom before her divorce went to church regularly, but her affiliation with it now is bordering on fanatic. What worries me specifically is how she always complains that she doesn't get sleep but when Sunday comes she has to go to church. Also she has huge debt but still donates good sums to the church.
This isn't one of those dark stories on Reddit, my mom is a sweetheart, but I can't help but feel like the church is taking advantage of her depression. Or maybe this is her way of coping with the divorce. At worst she'll turn into her mom who is painfully awkward to talk to about anything that isn't the religion or goes against it. What's your take on this? And are you in a similar situation?
"ATM" churches - and their pastors - typically prey upon people who happen to be in bad situations in order to win them over with their "health and wealth" gospel. Essentially, these pastors preach that giving money and attending church without fail will infallibly result in some sort of payout or reimbursement, although the only payout goes to making the churches palatial and opulent, and to line the pastors' pockets.

Pentecostal churches are the most clear and present of these, and are the lowest form of scum. Your mother is definitely a victim, although this kind of gospel is almost like alcohol or drugs with some people. It's addicting, and the only way to escape it is to have the willpower to escape it.


If she doesn't escape it, the brainwashing will eventually set in and she will become, as you mentioned, like her mother.

I wish you could see and listen to some of the kids that are born into these kinds of churches. It's disgusting.
My mother did something similar when I was young (10 or so) and I ended up growing up in a Pentecostal church. To this day she is a little awkward to talk to about anything which is directly opposed to her religious views, but so long as we avoid topics that I know she will have strong negative feelings about she is relatively easy to get along with.

While I absolutely, unconditionally agree with your concern over issues like donating money while in debt or getting enough sleep(these are simply logistical concerns, not religious concerns) I do think its worth it to try not judging too harshly. People cope with loss and stress in different ways. For many its to seek the comfort of a strict system or routine. For others its to seek a guiding system or ideology. For others its to seek comfort from belief. Religion can serve any and all of these needs. Other sources can ALSO serve these needs, but for her own reasons your mother appears to have selected (or stumbled upon) religion as her thing to cling to.

She could have equally turned to any other expensive hobby, or she could be seeing a therapist (which would cost money). In the end I personally believe the therapist would be the most effective, but that's for her to decide. Voicing your concern over the logistical aspects, especially with logical solutions, might be a good idea. (ie: pay off debt which will free up a larger portion of your income to then donate later, get more sleep Saturday or attend a later service to sleep in more Sunday)

Over all I wouldn't worry too much about it. Let her find her own way.
It does sound like she uses church to cope. If it to helps her than I guess that is a good thing. I would be concerned about the debt and maybe consider talking to her about tilting so much when she can't afford it, but you have to be willing to accept it will likely be an uncomfortable conversation.
The title. 
It's a second cousin. Your parent (from your grandma) is a first cousin to any child of your grandma's brother. Children of first cousins are second cousins to one another. Children of second cousins are third cousins to one another. First cousin once removed refers to your relationship to your parent's first cousin-- your children would be first cousins twice removed to that first cousin. 
Grandma's brother = Your great-uncle. His children would be called either '2nd cousins' or 'first cousins, once removed'. 

Some people will just use 1st, 2nd, 3rd for how far away on the family tree they are, but it quickly becomes confusing. I would say 'first cousins once removed', as they are only one branch over horizontally, but then are a generation step down (removed) from that branch. Hence your Great-Uncle's grandchildren would be first cousins TWICE removed, as they're only one branch over horizontally but two steps down that branch. 

Overall it's a little ambiguous and there's some disagreement on terminology, but I hope this helps anyway :)
So I am 26 with no children and when I started dating my girlfriend, who is 24 with a 5 year old daughter, her daughter and I had trouble bonding in the beginning,  primarily because I didn't know how to interact with a child, and because I was afraid to overstep boundaries as the boyfriend and upset my girlfriend.

Long story short after a long talk with Sara (girlfriend) she pretty much said I have no leash and no boundaries, and I can interact without being afraid she will get mad because if I screw something up she'll be thee to help me fix it.

Fast forward a couple months and yesterday,I was doing laundry and I come into my room and Sara goes, hey babe did you hear Ashley and I said no I wasn't in the room.

So Ashley scoots over by me on the bed and says when you marry mommy will you be my Daddy? (Her biological sperm donor vanished he day she found out she was pregnant). I told her I would love that and I told her do you feel like I'm your daddy and she said yeah you treat me like how mommy treats me, you treat me like a daddy should. I told her she can call me dad or daddy if she's ready, I said you can call me whatever you want, Jon, Jonny, dad, daddy, whatever makes you happy.

She said well for now let's stick with Jon because she doesn't want to upset mom (she wasn't in the room we had a private talk) she said I love you like a daddy but I'm still scared. Which I man rightfully so this is all new to the 3 of us.

She then asked, when mom marries me,  she keep her last name or take mine, and I said mom will have my last name, and she looked a little sad and I said you can have my last name too if you want. She asked how and I said do you know what adoption is? And she said yes and explained it. (Her mom is adopted)

And I told her when I marry mom if you let me, I can adopt you, I told her that means I will always be there for her, I will always be her daddy, and she will have my last name. She put her arms around me, told me she loved me and said forehead (it's an inside thing every time I kiss her if it's on her forehead I say forehead m, if it's cheek I say face) so I kiss her forehead and then she tells me that she can't wait for me to be her daddy forever.

So this took my crappie mood I was in and put me in a great mood.

Oh and on a side note Sara was talking to her friend and I was there and her friend asked what we're doing tomorrow and she said taking our daughter to the zoo. Sara then turned bright red and I talked to her about it. She really feels like her daughter is my daughter, and to me that's the most trust she can ever give me. And honestly I've never been happier.

Oh I forgot to mention, my girlfriend and I are going to be getting married and I'll be adopting her daughter. I talked about it with her, but we are waiting till I finish college, which is about a year and a half left. We agreed both of us in college and planning a wedding at the same time is to much at once. She has a year left but this has been decided.
It is great that things are going well. Please, please don't take this as criticism, but rather a caution. Are you planning on getting married to her mom and have you already talked about adoption? If not, I would tread lightly. The last thing you should do to earn her trust is promise her things you may not be able to follow through with. She is cautious because she doesn't want to get her hopes up because it is devistating when things go wrong. If you are getting married to her mom and she is good with the adoption tjen great. If none of these things have been decided I would hold off on saying anything definitive. When it comes to kids (be it yours or someone else's) it is never a good idea to promise something unless you are sure you can come through. Kids are very sensitve. They aren't going to full accept that something got in the way. To them a promise is a promise. In the future, make sute your language reflects things that are a promise as opposed to things that are a maybe. I truly hope you and your girlfriend get married and that you can adopt this little girl. 
Oh I guess I should have mentioned, we are getting married, a date isn't chosen yet because we agreed to wait the year and a half till I finish college
Congratulations. Sorry, I didn"t want to sound preachy becauae it sounds like you have the best if intentions. I just wanted to make sure it was happening before you told her. It sounds like you are on the right path. They are both lucky to have you. Best of luck :)
No I understand.

She's 5 so she's still processing her emotions, but every day she gets closer with me.
That is awesome! I hope things continue to get better and better :)
... Who married my cousin. What is my relation to my friend? 
They are cousins by marriage only.
I had to share with someone..

It's inevitable. Every July 14 I wonder if tomorrow you're going to think about me. I imagine you have the years tallied up, 23 years without seeing my daughter. 23 years of missing out on an amazing human being. 23 years of hugs and kisses that could've been. 23 years of missed dance recitals, soccer games, basketball games, swim meets, martial arts spars, spelling bees, science fairs, award ceremonies, report card pick-ups (I swear no teacher ever complained about me), silly moments, hard moments, skinned knees, broken hearts... 
I swear have enough, more than enough. I'm lucky enough to have two moms, two dads, and two siblings. I wouldn't think of changing them for anything in the world. I'm a happy person, relatively healthy, hard worker, intelligent, passionate, and above all I have a heart of gold. I have ambitions and dreams I work on accomplishing everyday. That's all I want you to know. I want you to know that you're missing out. I'm not, you are. And I feel sorry for you. 
For what you missed out on, you sure are a well-adjusted human being!
Thank you. I'm just mad my degree has his last name on it. 
There will come a day when I won't have to see you, won't have to talk to you, won't have to think of you. And I wont.
My grandmother is in the hospital breathing her last few precious breaths. I'm 15 and I have wasted so much time playing video games, on the phone, and watching pointless youtube videos that I didn't spend much time with my grandmother and now my grandmother has stopped recognizing people... I was so indulged with getting likes on my fucking facebook account, and basically wasting my time watching some shitty video about how a cocacola can is made and all other bullshit ...I can see my grandmother in the hospital but she doesn't even know who I am. I think I am done with the internet for the next 5 years. The regret I have will never go away.
Yes.  Live YOUR LIFE.  Live in the moment. Fuck the Internet. Internet should be used sparingly. Not to be used 24/7

Ps. I am sorry to hear about ur grandma. 


If you can, good luck. But really though, see you tomorrow.
You sound like a very intelligent and insightful person. I'm trying to cut way, way, way back myself. :) We can do it. 
My grandma (who I live with and helped raise me) is actively dying. It'll be within the next couple days or so. My grandparents have two sons. My dad and my uncle. My uncles wife absolutely hates me and my mom. We're all currently gathered around my grandmother in the living room and she's asleep on a hospital bed that was brought to the house. My grandparents have two other grandchildren who are older and have babies of their own. My grandparents and I have always been close I'm 20 and theyre really my second parents. Who stands up front at the funeral? My dad is going to need me but it'll be uncomfortable with my aunt up there. Do grandchildren stand up front? I'm just at a loss here. Also is there anywhere I can get some clothes to wear for the wake and funeral? What store would be the easiest to find clothes. Sorry for the rambling.
I don't know if anyone usually stands up at a funeral. If it's a religious one it's usually more of a mass, you will probably sit in the first few rows. You may or may not be asked to be a pallbearer. That's probably up to your father.

Receiving lines at wakes can get long, I would expect you by your father there. Shouldn't be an issue.

You might try Men's Warehouse or something for suits but that may be overkill. Funerals are usually less "dressy" affairs, any black suit will do, doesn't 100% have to be a suit but I suspect you'll want one regardless, nothing wrong with going well dressed out of respect.

In short, don't start drama, don't escalate it if it happens, be there for your father first and foremost. Best of luck and sorry for your loss.
I am so soert for what you are going through. /u/Arclite83 is right. You are likely to be part of the recieving line at the wake. At the funeral it depends on the type of service. They may need someone to do a reading. That is up to you. If you don't feel comfortable that is okay too. Best of luck.
I'm very mad but not because I'm spoiled but because she says that my instructor told her I need more practice so she won't let me drive now. I know most driving instructors say that to stir up more business. 
If you need more practice then your instructor should have not passed you. I would probably complain to the company. Seems weird.
Have a talk with her. Sit down, ask her SPECIFICALLY what you need to improve on. If she can't think of anything, great. You won. Otherwise, listen carefully to what she says and make sure to make her realize that you can do it.

This shit sucks man, I got my license but my family is poor and doesn't think getting me a car/insurance is a priority.... not even sure if I'm gonna get a car before I graduate high school
This is why I am 30 and don't drive. I need to know that I have kids, but it is terrifying. My parents made me get a liscene and then wouldn't let me drive. Trying to break through the fear, especially with anxiety and depression is hard.
So, I mow the lawn whenever it needs to be cut, I vacuum the house every Saturday morning, I help my dad whenever he needs me, get up daily 6:15 am even on sat or sun. I am 1 of 6 children and I do most of the work. I am only 14. Second oldest. My dad is always yelling at me and makes me cry a lot. Like I am helping him trimming trees and he tells me to go get the black can and I get it but he want the green one or I was taking too long he yells and tells me to go inside. I al allergic to grass and I sneeze a storm when I cut the grass. I need help. I can't live like this anymore.
Some people are not happy unless they are miserable. My mother in law is like this. It doesn't matter how much you help, he will never appreciate it. I am sorry.
Sit down with him and ask for a talk. If he doesn't realize what the fuck he's doing after that, then I'm truly sorry. After you're done with high school the torment will be over.
Work hard so you can get out of there when your 18. Its never going to get better. Talking to him will probably make little to no difference. Don't try to please him, don't try to impress him. Just do what you need to do to make it through having to live with him and get out as soon as you can. 
Any suggestions? My fiance works part time and makes 21.50 an hour as a respiratory therapist. She brings home $500 every 2 weeks. I am a robotic welder st a factory and I work 40-60 hours a week making $11.35 an hour. I bring home about $300 a week after taxes and $100 dollars a week for child support (1 kid). 

No matter how hard we try. We are always broke by Monday. I mean we have bills backed up and are slowly paying them every week and that doesn't help us save money, maybe we will have more cash in our pockets after we get all caught up? I'm getting burned out though. Constantly working 10 hour shifts (night shift) to stay broke.... any advice?
https://m.reddit.com/r/personalfinance may be a good place to try. They are great at helping people budget and such.
Is there any specific reason why your fiance works part time?
I am 27(m) and an asian. I studied business management and worked in my dad's construction company for two years already and i really felt unhappy about my work. My dad's over controlled behavior is really killing the real me. He wants me to what he has dreamt for.  He thinks all about life is money. All i want is just a happy working condition. He wants my mindset to change like him. I can sense it. Is it fair for me? Cant i just choose my career for what i want to be? 
This is my first time writing and pardon me for my writing errors.
You should be allowed to do what you want. If you are unhappy there then you should leave, but I would make sure to have your living arrangements set before you do it. Your dad may not talk to you for at bitx but you have to dk whaf is right for you.
Maybe you can find a positive way to do it. Get your CV out and around. Wait until you get an amazing opportunity. Then go to your father and say that you have been offered a job that is just too good to pass up. It will be great for your career, great financially, etc. Hopefully, your father will be happy for you and support you in your decision, because it is the right one for you. Or maybe you can get your mother (or other relatives) to help him to understand that the new job is important for you.
Thanks for the advice.
Thanks for the advice. 👍👍👍
Your very welcome. I am sorry you are in this situation.
Hi all, this is about me and the relationship I have w/ my father. He currently has depression (it's to do with problems w/ his childhood and his parents) and it really has had an effect on the rest of my family. I am 18, and living at home with my parents and younger brother and sister. Basically, my father has been showing aggressive behaviour since I can remember myself (and has been happening even before I was born between my mother and father). I grew up in a house where my parents would be constantly arguing, or he would wind her up, or wind me and my siblings up in order to fight with each other. He would also make sarcastic statements about me, y mother and my siblings in order to put us down, whether it was my mothers weight, my brothers personality or anything under the sun that he could make a comment about (almost like bullying). He would have a go at us over the most petty of things and his behaviour towards us has resulted in my brother showing depression symptoms. Even tonight, as I speak, he had a go at us (and even threatened to punch my younger brother in the face and made my mother cry after getting aggressive, and I would note, it's one of his worse spells in years) over an incident earlier involving food were he asked for some chips from my siblings plates, to which they refused as they do not trust him enough to let him have any, incase he took anything else from their plates, (really petty and silly, I know). I myself am always wondering when he is going to loose his temper next, and I can often tell when his anger is brewing, having been through so many of his spells. He is currently on a high dose of medication for his depression but he seems to go through ups and downs with his temper, this was the first time in two weeks that he had a go at us, but it can very from weekly to monthly gaps in the spells. He has used his bullying and aggression on me mainly over school or my personality (I am currently retaking the year, and ever since I can remember he has called me a failure/not up to scratch/not grammar school material, which I think is linked to his jealousy of me attending a Grammar school, and that my mum pays much more attention to me and my education than his parents did to him). If he asks me to do something for him, I often take ages or half arse it as I do not respect him enough to do it properly. I am wondering how I should address this situation, as I am currently an 'adult' and I am sick of his behaviour. I feel that I cannot have a adult conversation as he seems to not have a rational system of thought. I would like to stand up to him but I feel that it would end with violence. Is there any way I can deal with him that would not cause him to argue or have any backlash from him. I fell that it's really taking it's toll after years and years with my relationship between me, my siblings and my mother, who are all very close. Many thanks 
Is there any realistic chance of you moving out in the immediate future?

This does not sound like a healthy environment to be in.
Pick the best moment and gently ask how he's doing? I'm a total stranger so I might be wrong, but it sounds like he's frustrated about something and it's unresolved. Maybe he can talk it out, maybe he can't. 
Tell me about brothers fight
Father's Day is always hard for me. My dad wad abusive and we haven't spoken in years due to me wanting to protect myself and family. Was just curious if anyone else has gone through the same thing....
I am so sorry that you went through that. It sounds like you have made the right call distancing yourself. I don't have the same experience. Mother's day is hard for me because I lost a child and then what would have been my first mother's day was crappy. I was pregnant, but only my husband and two other people knew, he had to fly out for a business trip that he couldn't cancel, and none of my family called to ask how I was but expected a call to wish them a happy mother's day. Even with two, healthy, beautiful kids I find it hard to get over the trauma.

Be kind to yourself and accept that what you are feeling is completely within bounds. You have every reason to have a hard time with ithe and if that means you need some space that is okay too. Do what feels right for you.
I have a hard time with Fathers Day. Mine is a reclusive, heavy smoking alcoholic that outlived his suicide type pact with my stepmother. I don't respect, understand or enjoy spending time with him. I think he's too scared to commit suicide and has just been kicking the can for the last 10yr. He's selfish, lazy, and stinks....but he's the only Dad I'll ever have. 
Thank you. And I'm so sorry for your loss. I had a miscarriage years ago and while mine in no way compares, I do understand a little of your pain and sense of loss. 
I am so sorry for your loss. Sometimes it is harder because people understand how horrible a loss a miscarriage is.
Just wanna get some opinions on this. 

This Stanford sexual assault case has me wondering if a family of someone charged with a crime should feel obligated to apologize to a victim even though, aside from raising the person, they have no control over their child's actions. This is assuming that it's an "average" family with no crazy issues. 
Of course not. Why would they?
It depends. If the person in charge is an adult, then no. That person is responsible for his/her own actions. If the person is a child then maybe. It is good to show kids how to apologize and if they are really young and don't yet know how to apologize then I say you should.  The father in the Stanford rape case is awful because he is so out of touch he can't see what his kid did was wrong. This kind of attitude is part of the problem here.  The kid didn't learn things were off limit to him so he took what he wanted. Pleading for mercy for your child is one thing. You love.your kids and so it makes sense you want to help them. Acting like your kid is the victim when he committed a heinous act is not understandable and downright disturbing. That is my two cents, anyways. 

I am really interested in what others have to say. Great question :)
I've been home for the summer from college for about a month now. I've been staying with my parents, sister, and my baby brother(who will be a 1 year old at the end of the month). My grandmother lived with my parents at the beginning of the summer to help watch the baby during the day. My dad is a nurse at a pediatrician clinic and my mom is a nurse during the night shift at two different hospitals. My sister commuted to college during the school year and was able to get a full time retail job not too far away from home. I think it's great that my grandmother watched over my baby brother since she also did to same with me, my sister, and all my cousins when we were kids. The first couple of days were great, but then I slowly started realizing that things weren't all that dandy. Truth is, they were treating my grandmother like shit. Not in a way that they were mean to her or anything, but in a way that she isn't given enough recognition. She never complained or asked for anything while babysitting, in return my parents make her sleep on a little love seat couch every night (while my bedroom was completely empty to sleep in while I was away at college). Since my parents were also either at work or sleeping, there was never much interaction with them and my grandma, except when my dad got home from work and started watching my brother. A couple of days fly by and my grandmother is leaving to go watch my baby cousin (who is 3 months younger than my brother and has a mom that currently is unemployed). My parents thought she was only going to be gone for a couple of days, but she ends up being gone for more than 2 weeks. With her being gone, it was up to mainly me to fill in for my grandma. I didn't mind at first, but morality started to grow thinner with each passing day. Don't get me wrong, I love my brother and I would do anything for him, but watching him 4-5 days out of the week for 7-12 hours really gets to me sometimes, especially when the kid isn't mine. My parents knew I was actively looking for a summer job to have some spare change for the school year, but they expected me to put family first. I could understand this at first, but now after a couple of weeks have passed by its like I have to put my own life on hold, while my parents are living the same one they had before my brother was born. I brought this attention up to my parents before and they say I should put family before anything and that I shouldn't get a job or really do anything because my brother needs to be babysat. They also said that if I don't like it I should just give up my phone, car, and everything else my parents have paid for. I have to readjust plans or come home early with my friends/girlfriend/other events because the baby needed to be watched. I've contemplated moving out, but I want to be in the baby's life as much as possible. Growing up as a kid, my parents did the same exact thing. When me and my sister were old enough, we were pretty much on our own, because my parents were either asleep or working. I don't want my baby brother to grow up like that. He's almost 1 years old and I feel like he is just a little bit behind the curve, and I feel like it's because my parents don't push him to do anything. I've caught my mom asleep on the floor in his playroom, while he just sits idly in his pack n play. He can't walk yet, and I've been trying to teach him by practicing, but its hard when no one else puts in the effort besides me. At this point I'm just frustrated and don't know what to do. 

I'm very sorry with the formatting of this post, I'm not the strongest writer and I was just typing away my thoughts as they came. 
My sister’s kid is graduating this Sunday, my family is making  a big deal about it, planning to go, having a cookout afterward.  On surface seems normal, but I don’t think it is.  The kid barely, I mean barely graduated and I know for a fact strings were pulled and exceptions were made by his teachers and the school to make it happen. The kid is just not your typical jerk teenager, he’s been arrested  a bunch of  times for stuff (nothing violent), has punched holes in walls in my sis’s place, stolen and sold her things, just a month ago he was suspended from school for reeking like pot.  To top things off, he’s a very unpleasant little crap.  

I so bad want to tell my sister that he’s not deserving of anything, let alone celebrating what is a sham of a graduation.  Should I just keep this to myself? She’s apparently  real happy and my wife says I shouldn’t burst her bubble, but I kind of feel she/he needs a reality check.   It’s kind of a cycle of his parents burying their head in the sand when it comes to doing and saying the right thing for this kid, this seems like just another instance of that.  I do realize though, that even if say something, it’s probably more for me than them because expressing my thoughts on the issue won’t change anything.  Just for some reference, I have a real good relationship with my sister, we have never, and I mean never argued or offended each other.  She’s about 10 years older than me and treats me like I’m still 10.  I’m 41! 

You should just keep your mouth shut. You telling your sister that her kid doesn't deserve his graduation celebration is not what will give her a wakeup call, it's just you being a jerk.
Something will be said, now is not the time. 
 While I was working with you, we were working toward the same end: a successful and profitable  business, while maintaining a standard of business ethics that ensured optimal outcomes and positive interactions for all parties.

I love you. I am sure of your brotherly affection for me. So why was it so difficult to achieve a synchronicity between us that would allow us to realise this goal? I have thought and thought about this over the last few months. This is part of what I have considered.

You once reminded me that I am a unique individual, with unique perspectives and opinions. It was meant as a self esteem-building truth to consider, and I have reminded myself of that moment many times when trying to put my life into perspective. I agree with you, that each of us brings with them illumination of a different aspect of life. We may draw different conclusions from the same evidence, however.

There is a fundamental difference in the way that we each see and experience life. I would like to use an example to try to illustrate one aspect of that difference. Please see this only as a crude illustration of a much more complex picture.

You have pointed out to me that perhaps I have lived a simple life because I had no money, rather than by choice, and I had to agree that I do often see and want things, but am unable to afford them. I think though, that you have missed a bigger part of my world view.

It is because I was forced to pare down and consider what was important to me, when I stopped working, that I have been able to better understand what I ultimately need in order to be happy. My happiness really does have nothing to do with pretty things or ingenious gadgets, although I certainly like and appreciate both things. 

If I see them in magazines or on TV or the Internet, I definitely consider how nice it might be to own such a thing, or how awesome a particular experience could be. That moment passes pretty quickly, though, particularly if I happen to be sitting on my back deck listening to the birds, or watching the dogs play, or any one of a hundred other things that give me genuine joy and serenity. It is not important enough to me to make a real mark on my psyche. If it is, I usually find a way, eventually, to get what I am seeking.

If I have the immediate funds, it is much easier for me to decide in the moment to satisfy my urge to have the new shiny thing. Indeed, I even have an excuse, in the form of a bipolar diagnoses, which brings with it an element of compulsive spending, and I am fairly confidant that you are familiar with that.  It is easy, and fun, for me to literally buy into the mindset of being immediately gratified with my latest purchase. I have, of course, done quite a lot of that in my lifetime. And that is why I genuinely don't want to do it anymore.

I don't want to want things. I am extremely happy finding new ways to find joy and satisfaction in life, simply, with what life presents to me. That does not mean that I don't want to make a contribution to society or try new things. I had little say in shaping the world in which I find myself, but I do feel compelled to add to that world such that there will be a net positive gain to the whole, and to explore as much as I can while I'm here. I am sure that you have similar stirrings.

The available possibilities of how that might be achieved are infinite, although certainly limited in any particular circumstance. Importantly, I believe that the value of those possibilities cannot be judged against each other, as we have no way of knowing the ultimate impact of all of our actions. 

The options that you and I see in front of us are very different, as are the goals that we are individually working towards. It is not surprising that we both have clear paths before us, to which we are each equally committed, that diverge from each other greatly. I do not believe that either of those paths are wrong. They are both equally valid, given our individual world views, and learned responses arising from them.

I do not have to be wrong in order for you to be right. Your perspective is a valuable component of my world, one for me to consider and integrate into my life, as feels right for me at the time. Exactly as you may consider my view in your own life. You may take or leave whatever you choose from my description of the world, but I think it is valuable to at least consider the possibilities of how the addition of a different dimension might alter your own view of life.

I don't fit into the corporate paradigm. I tried it for many years, and it does not sit well with me. It is too difficult for me to reconcile my view of life's purpose with the core values that must be adopted, in order to be a relevant part of that world. My acceptance of this about myself, and movement towards something more authentically me in my own life has, I think, been a source of some of the discord between us. 

What I see as a valid life path, you experience as a somehow diminished journey. It is not important that we agree about these paths, but it is useful, if we want to achieve a mutually engaging and fulfilling relationship, to accept that they may be equally valid, simply different, perspectives of the same larger picture.

I apologise for this rambling commentary, but it has felt important for me to lay out as fully as I can how and why I make the choices that I face, and to try to help you understand that I have always championed your success and happiness, however you choose to find it. It may not always have appeared so to you, but this has always been the case. I appeal to you to try and accept that, although you may not see any value for my choices in your life, they do hold importance in mine, and that I have never, even once in my life, wanted anything for you other than what you have wanted for yourself.
Hello, my father is 59years old, will turn 60 in januar. He and my mother(53) are constantly arguing about money. Both have a pretty decent paying job considering our country. But in the last few years my father started to spend less and less money on the family and instead is buying cars every few months, or looking for an apartman, a field to build on etc. Ofc my mother is really upset about it since she has to pay almost everything, becaus of this they argue almost everyday. According to my father he says he doesnt want to spend money on us because we dont respect him, when they argue its always about when one of them didnt had a job and only one of them worked, who had to work for the whole family, etc. My mother is really angry because on the end of the month is usually her with almost nothing on her credit card meanwhile father has usually a decent amount of money on his own. Currently he has 6 cars, ofc they are the cheap ones like 2 Ford orion, 2 Renault Clio, one Ford Focus and a Crysler Voyager....  Im pretty sure this is all about gate closing panic or im not so sure... but he also always charges my mother with being unfaithfull which is absolute bullsht, they both are old, and i work on same place as my mom, usually same shifts and there is nothing... Im pretty sure he just wants to feel young again, worrying about love etc.. which i found pathetic to be honest... 

Just wanted to share this. 
I don't trust my sister-in-law. I don't trust her around my kids.

My reasons are many -- too many to get into here. But my question: How do I bring this up with my wife's family? I have no "hard evidence," but the girl is very odd and has said some very inappropriate things about my son, in particular.

Am I overstepping my bounds to say something? To forbid her to watch my son alone?
Don't bring it up with your wife's family... Just bring it up with your wife. Does your wife actually pick up on this as well? Or she doesn't mind her sister watching your son? After you discuss it with your wife make sure your wife tells whomever family member she  leaves your son with to not leave him alone with this particular family member and don't let her watch your son. Just be like.. "Oh, no, he has a play date with so & so.. Sorry". I mean, is she one of those family member's that beg to watch your child? I don't have kids but my husband and I have already discussed which family members to trust with our kids and which ones not to, lol. I feel you. I mean, I just watch how certain people interact with kids and I think to myself.."Oh no, I would never let them watch my child". 

He is your son, if you don't want him around her alone then you are within your bounds. I would probably have a sit down with your partner so you are on the same page.
i live in England and recently traveled to France to meet my uncle. he has 4 children, a boy and 3 girls. i spoke to the boy on Facebook before meeting as my uncle showed me a picture of him and i added him on Facebook. A bit of background, my family is muslim and i feel weird talking to female cousins around the same age as i feel that they might feel weirded out. I have a few female friends at University but feel strange talking to female family around my age. My culture says that we should be family oriented. While I was there, they were often at University so I couldn't talk to them as much. I really got to know the male cousin as we used video games (playstation) to open the "meeting in person and not speaking on Facebook barrier". We exchanged music from french and english culture, mostly hip hop. I could see that they wanted to talk but we all knew there is a language barrier which we need to overcome. On the last day I spoke to one of them and saw that two were really shy and one wasn't as shy. One even got a photo album and looked at us so we could get to know each other. What is your advice on opening up shy people for the next time I visit them?
It is hard for me to give advice because there seems to be a cultural issue I am not familiar with. It shouldn't  matter if your cousins are male or female. They are people, just like anyone else. Talk to theme about your interests. Ask them what they are interested in. See where things go from there.
So my brother lives 7 hours away. I don't see him much. He has invited me to his home quite a few times and I finally am taking him up on his offer. He did offer that we stay with him. I wanted to get a hotel room but they are outrageous. He lives by the ocean and it's going to be 4th of July weekend so they jacked the prices up. I just don't know how to act. I just dont want to be in the way and I want them to have their own privacy. It's only him and his wife. Any suggestions for being a good houseguest?
Don't  leave a mess. Don't stay up ridiculously late or get up really early (unless it is something you are all do together). Bring them a gift as a thank you (like a bottle of wine) or take them out to dinner as a thank you. Don't make big demands. The fact that that you are worried about being a good guest means you are likely going to be a good guest. I hope you have an awesome time :)
Awww thanks for the great advice.
I know this may sound mean of me to say but my gran is such a pain in the ass, I know some people have issues with their grandmothers but please tell me what you think of mine and what I should do... im currently unemployed so I can't exactly leave home. 

Well pretty much my gran is a money hungry old lady,  everything has to revolve around her, she lives with my mom and I and shes been leeching off my moms money for years and my moms elder sister does nothing about it, in fact my moms sister is the same as my gran they're just nice to my mom so she buys them things. My gran would take her daughters shopping but she would tell my mom the daughter she is living with to pay her back but not my aunt and she would take money from my mom to buy my aunt whitening tablets.

My gran loves to have control over everything, she bosses my mom around and my mom is 40 and im 19, when my mom works late she phones my mom every 30 minutes asking where is she and why is she not home and if my mom and I are out she does the same thing, my gran can get violent at times and well I've tried talking to my mom but she says she will fix it but wont do anything,  she gives into my gran and im worried because my gran just takes money from my mom I might not eventually go to university because of this, my mom bought me a decent priced car and its mine but my gran insists on keeping the car keys like there is no logic with this woman.

I honestly dont know what to do because my mom doesn't seem to want to hear me out and I have nowhere else to go.
1. Get job. 
2. Save up (aka hid as much as you can from grams)  
3. Move out of there asap.  

Those are the only logical steps I can think of. Good luck friend.
Is your grandma capable of taking care of herself? It seems like she wants everyone to do the work for her. Everything that is yours and your moms, she sees as hers. 
I would be worried about what she's spending it on, is she gambling money away or just buying herself things?

How does your mom not see this as a problem? I can't imagine your mom is just okay with handing everything she works hard for over to her mom. Does she not want control over her life back?

Can your grandma live with her other daughter for a while, just to catch a break for you guys.
Thanks friend will give it a try :)
No gambling, she buys a lot of unnecessary things for my aunt, such as whitening tablets and a lot of clothes which my aunt still takes from my mom. Whenever an argument breaks out with my mom and gran, my gran would say im going to Vanessas (my aunt) house yet she doesn't, my grandmother has no reason within her.
I'm 30. I stopped speaking to my father several years ago because he's an incredibly selfish and hateful person. That's been the case since long before I was born, but I only recently decided to break off my relationship completely because not only was it making me miserable, but it wasn't helping him in any perceivable way. There's no way to fix him (I'm the fourth immediate family member to excommunicate him over the course of four decades), but if I distance myself from him I can fix myself and help the rest of my family and not get dragged down with him. Whether that's right or wrong, that's the logic I used.

So, moving to the present day ... 

My mother has had severe depression as long as I've been alive, as does most of her immediate family, but she "doesn't believe in depression, it's just lazy people making up excuses ...", and will never accept any type of treatment, counseling, or other. Basically, I don't think fixing the depression is an option because she's spent the past fifty years telling herself it doesn't exist. Her self-prescribed treatment is an extremely active, life long martyr complex. My mother, unlike my father, is a very nice person, and she did her best to raise me well, aside from insisting for 18 years that I did not have depression, even changing our family doctor multiple times after they repeatedly diagnosed me. Now I'm looking at a similar problem. My mother is very nice, but basically toxic. She's incredibly self destructive and her misery loves company. Whenever my sane family members are around her and we don't go along with her self destructive tendencies, it makes her more sad, because she's not getting the sympathy that she feed off of. What do you do in this situation? I'm not giving up on my mom, even though I've long since given up on actually making her happy. Over the past ten years I've tried every potential path toward happiness I could think of. My goal at this point is to slow down the downward spiral as much as possible, just pure damage control. At the same time, it's taken me ten years physically and emotionally distanced from her to unlearn all the bad habits she bred into me. How do you try to keep a toxic, actively misery-seeking loved one from hurting themself more without letting them drag you down with them? Especially when you feel like any attention you give them is just enabling their bad habits?

I realize I'm not giving much detail. The details are complicated and I don't fully understand them myself, as usual. I also realize this probably isn't all that rare of a problem. Anyone who has racist grandparents or anyone who's parents tell them following their dreams is unrealistic is in more or less the same boat. I guess I'm just looking for general advice, where to draw lines. Obviously I still feel guilty about cutting off my dad, and I always will, even though he's a terrible person and he deserves much worse. I'm not leaving my mom, no matter what. Right now my strategy is visiting her every other weekend (she lives 200 miles away), completely playing along with all of her craziness for a few days, then going back home to my emotionally stable other life. But if an infinite amount of effort on my part is only going to slow her decline, if she's an emotional black hole, how much do I give? If I feel like any attention I give her is just enabling her more? How do you decide that?
Hello. I had a similar situation growing up.  I had a talk with my mother. Told her that i understand that she doesn't believe in depression yata yata, but that certain things she does makes me feel upset, sad, or just funky and uncomfortable.  I told her that i would appreciate if she stopped doing those things around me, and asked for boundaries. 

At first, she didn't understand all of the little things that made me feel that way. And she is a genuinely nice person that cares about me and tries. She didn't always understand why her behaviors made me unhappy. I explained that maybe she didn't have to, but she could try to stop doing the around me. Gradually as she did things,  i would say "mom this is an example of what i am talking about. Can we please change the the topic or can you please not say things like that."

Obviously, its a two way street and we both try and i have to give on a variety of things for her well being too. You may not realize how many of your dads bad behaviors you have and project onto your mom that trigger that behavior. 

Its been 5 years since we started doing that and i now have the best relationship with my mother i have ever had. Sometimes we have problems, but we work through them. And that is ok.

I have 1 son with my husband. He is 4 this coming August. Loooong story short, but my husband had a child from an affair born last July. The baby's mom is almost ready for my son and I to meet her and the baby. Initially she felt she didn't want to share the child and also didn't want to face me, so my husband was allowed to see the baby, but only if he did so in her presence and alone. My husband has maintained contact with the child in order to bond/attach/establish a relationship, which I have supported and my husband I are working through this to stay together. After everyone meeting in about a month, we will begin to share custody in a more traditional set-up.

Question: I am looking to see if anyone can speak from experience growing up in a similar situation. I'd like to do my best to support my son and support my step-son as we all find a way to raise these kids and co-parent. I know stability/routine is a must, but what else can anyone share?

Thanks in advance. I know families are complicated in even the most traditional set-up, so throw in a few variables and lots of emotions and this isn't always easy to navigate.
All I can say is you are a wonderful woman to look past the pain and help raise this child. I wish you all the luck in the world.

My only advice is that a child younger than 3-5 should not spend nights or weekends away from his primary care giver. Most experts on child development agree, though the age range may vary. If you are planning to share custody, that should not involve sleepovers for several more years, it would be high disruptive for the child's development and secure attachment to his mother. Just being a regular presence in his life will be adequate to establish and maintain and relationship, the same as with any other non-custodial adult care-giver who doesn't live in the home. 

Once he is older, transitioning to sharing weekends is a more viable and less disruptive option.
thanks, I appreciate your kind words.
thanks, yes we are definitely not pushing for overnight stays at this age.
My husband and I (F/43) are having a disagreement ... His parents stink -- literally!! While they are nice people, they are hoarders and a strong mildew/moldy smell has taken over their house. I feel like I'm going to have an asthma attack every time I go in there -- I don't have asthma and don't feel that anywhere else. They even smell when we meet at a restaurant.  I can't sit next to them without getting a headache. Our 12 year old went over there a few months ago for a few hours and came home smelling of mold. I have even had to throw out some of my clothes after they were in the closet w a gift from them.

  Now for our argument ... I don't want to bring their gifts or stuff into our home, because I don't want their mold spores here. Anytime we meet, I want to take off our clothes and wash immediately after we get home. Especially now since we are renovating after severe storm damage w a lot of water coming into our house. I want to keep our home and belongings free of stinky mold.

  My husband says he doesn't know what is right. What do you think?
So I work on a concept about lost voicemails that were never sent, and for Mother's Day, we are asking people to send in messages for their mom to 'leave her a message' if they don't have the opportunity too.

Hi,
Okay so a long story short, I'm currently working in London living at home, in a 4 year long-long distance relationship. I'm 26 years old.

Me and my girlfriend have decided to live in her area of England (Hull area) which is a 3 hour drive from my hometown.

I've recently just been offered a job in her area, where I'll be taking a large pay cut, but will have no commuting costs and housing is much cheaper.

My parents are completely against my decision, they say its stupid for me to take such a big pay cut, they've said they think im going backward in my career (even though the job itself is great). They say I shouldn't be moving to an area with much higher unemployment. They are saying because of my decision they won't be supporting me financially if I need it, and that I'm effectively cutting them out of my life in my decision.

My mum also started to cry saying I've lost my aspirations in life, and she doesn't know me anymore.

How do I approach parents like this?

I suffer from anxiety too (ocd), from a young age, so this is really just making me doubt everything now. It's keeping me up at night, sweating, not eating etc.

Thanks in advance for reading.
I can't say I have any specific advice for you, I'm sorry. But I have some experience in parents not approving ones decisions in life and I know what you mean when you say it keeps you up at night, eating bad etc.

If you and your girlfriend have been thinking this through, which it seems yoi have, and are taking this decision together - then that's your choice and your parents should not be interfering like that. It's a very low blow by your parents to say that you are cutting them out by making this decision.

I am sorry for your situation and I hope other redditors can provide more accurate advice on this matter.
Wow they sound really tough-minded. It's hard to give advise on this sort of thing.  You are only 26 years old. Were you living with your parents by chance?
How much in cut in pay is it exactly? If you weighed the pay against the commute and the lower cost of living and it is still doable then do what you feel is right. You and GF should make a plan for yourselves. 
It could be that your parents don't want you to hook up with your long-distance girlfriend. 
It seems that your parents are being over-dramatic. You shouldn't let them dictate what you do. They should let you be happy. They are only afraid you will make mistakes. They need to "let go" and let you make your own decisions and if you make a mistake, be the wiser for it. 
I'm sorry you're dealing with these guilt-trips. Of course your parents wouldn't want you further away but If you've weighed the options and truly want to make the move, then why shouldn't you? Sure you'll be a bit further from your parents but 3 hours isn't too bad. 

This should make you feel better, I'm only 21, my fiance 23 and we have 2 small children. We just made a BIG move from the Chicago suburbs to southern Colorado. If we could do it I think anyone could with proper preparation.

If you have the means to make the move then go for it because I know we would have regretted giving in and staying around just because family wanted us to. It's a big decision and YOUR decision. If them not being able to financially support you is going to be a problem though, you may want to have some second thoughts. You have to make sure you got your own back and it sounds like you do with this new job offer along with the cheaper housing and no commuting costs.

I know your parents feel sad, but saying things like you're cutting them out of your life is inaccurate and you need to tell them that. As for your mom saying you lost aspirations, tell her how she isn't supportive of your aspiration to make this move to be with your girlfriend of 4 years. Tell your parents you will be fine and that you guys can chat on webcam once a week. You guys can even meet halfway every once in a while to grab a bite to eat. There's no reason you can't make sure to get together for the holidays. They're being pessimistic, try to be optimistic. 

Hope that helped you a little bit, dealing with negative emotions from the people you love is always tough.
Back story: My (25/f) brother (30/m) has been married for 2 years now to my SIL (29/f). They recently had my nephew 6 months ago. She is the least friendly person i have ever met (insecure, indecisive, she had depression, she is just all around NOT friendly, hence why she has virtually no friends and only her 2 older sisters in her life) She has looked down on my family from the day they got engaged and i feel like she's making my brother do the same. Her family is extremely wealthy, and she grew up with lots and lots of money. Mine, we weren't "poor", but my parents didn't graduate college, we've always been solidly middle class. Funnily, my brother, sister and I have learned to have a strong work ethic because of my parents and the three of us are doing EXTREMELY well. Whereas, her and her sisters don't compare to what we have been able to do, financially and without daddy's help, well the three of them would be hurting (He bought them all their first homes) It.. enrages me when she talks down about my family. And now i feel like because my brother spends a TON of time with them, he is starting to look down on my parents financial status. My parents busted their asses for us 3 kids and showed us how to work hard for what we want. My sister and i have both tried to talk some sense into him, yet he sweeps it under the rug. I dislike having to be around her sometimes, honestly. She is so rude to my mom and it gets on my last nerve. My brother is the way he is BECAUSE of my parents! She has never once thanked my parents for anything they've done for them. I know it hurts my mom because this is her first grandson's mom. 
Ugh. Any advice for hard to handle in-laws? 

TL/DR: issues with brother's wife, any older and wiser folks have any advice? 
  
Are you nice to her? From this post, you seem to be talking down to her as well. I would not get involved or express yourself anymore to your brother. That is his wife and the mother of his child. The more you say to him, the more he is gonna tell his wife you said, the more she is going to resent you. From now on I would recommend being very nice to her and saying good things about her to your brother. The kinder you are to her, the kinder she will be to you and your family. Her dislike for your family probably comes from her insecurities, especially if you have ever made any comments about her daddys money. I think you should just try to start fresh and fake it till you make it. He obviously loves her for a reason, and you should focus on that. Be the bigger person! 
If so many of the details ( number of siblings, age of son, etc) weren't different I would think you could be my SIL. So I'll try to give you advice from the opposite side of the coin. 

My SIL has made clear that she doesn't like me and that she believes I look down on her family simply because mine is wealthy, while I gurantee that couldn't be farther from the truth. However what has driven a wedge between us is that her and the rest of my hubby's family assume that because my father is wealthy I've had life on easy street and haven't ever had to earn my way in life and look down on me for that. 

In reality they have made so many false assumptions about my life that just aren't true. Sure I may have a paid off car, I may have the opportunity to go to college, my hubby may now have the opportunity to go to college as well, and I've been on a few expensive vacations, but  I also witnessed my parents' marriage implode taking me along for the ride, I suffered both physical and emotional abuse  to the point I was removed from one of my parents homes, I took care of my sibling exclusively for years starting at 10,  began working at 15 and moved out at 17. There was a period of about 5 years where I didn't even talk to either of my parents much less recieve any emotional or financial support, but just because when I met my husband I was mending bridges with my dad and he was financially helping me for the first time my SIL and her family disregard or don't care about what my life was really like and honestly can't get past their assumptions enough to honestly get to know me. 

My point is you don't know your SIL, and it doesn't sound like you've really tried to get to know her. Like me she may be a lot more grounded than you think. She may have experienced things you can't even imagine and you wouldn't know because you haven't treated her like family. 

I will say I have other issues with my In laws that cause ill feelings, like debt they racked up and refused to pay back in my husbands name, but to them the reason I don't like them is as simple as I was richer than them when that truly couldn't be further from the truth... 

If you truly want to improve this relationship try to change your own mindset first, don't assume anything she says has anything to do with the financial disparity, don't assume anything about her life in general, put all of that aside and truly get to know her. Find out her interests, if you live close enough offer to come over to help with LO, invite her for a girls night out with you and your mom, include her gain her trust and truly care and you may be amazed at the relationship you can develop. 

Otherwise this type of thing can drive a wedge b/w your family and your brother. I know because we are going thru it right now. My FIL said some horrible things about my family's finances and me  thinking his son would back him up, instead my hubby made the choice to go nc until such time as his dad apologizes, which isn't coming anytime soon. Ironically I actually miss his family and it bugs me more than him since I never had a close knit family growing up... 





This. If the roles were reversed and your brother didn't like your SO it would cause a rift. In my family my siblings and I all have opinions on each other's spouses. Now that it's out, it caused us to cool off to each other and basically turn more to our SO's. It sucks because the more time goes on, the easier it is to not pick up the phone or make plans. I miss my neice and nephews but I have a family of my own. 

Basically what i am saying is get used to having her in your life. If you chat her up and treat her like a family member, then she will drop the cold shoulder and be comfortable to share in conversation, etc. 

It could be worse. She could be an addict/abusive, etc. 
The other weekend my mom and I had a discussion regarding a certain topic. We had a discussion and I pointed out the reason my thought was correct and in the end my mom decided that she agreed with me.... or so I thought. Later the next day she begins talking about it again. Which I thought based on the earlier discussion that this topic was completed and that the decision was mutually acceptable. I was then informed that the only reason I was agreed with was to shut me up.

I feel offended by this and have since been grinding on this and am slowing getting more and more annoyed. I have communicated to my mom that it offended me and that it was hurtful to hear that said to her own son. I may think that to myself but I would never articulate that to anyone. It would be hurtful to say that to someone.

Am I over reacting or do I have valid point.

I know that some the detail is missing its more about the "only reason I was agreed with was to shut me up."


Although I've never been in the similar situation (my mother usually handles discussions in more of a passive aggressive way so to speak), I wouldn't say you are overreacting in any way. You didn't mention the exact subject of the discussion or what your arguments was (and I don't encourage you to) but from what you say it seems you handled it well and she struck a rather low blow at you afterwards. I would have felt the same way as you do if my mother did the same thing.

Fwiw, sending positive thoughts.
I'm speaking on my behalf, and I'm not a professional.
You can react as you want. You have better to think about your reactios, does it worth it (to get offended), or simly enough to move on.
I never get offended, not because others wasn't offensive, just because I haven't done the effort to get offended.
So there was an apology, and the balance is restored. Everything is good.
Tell your mother that she is entitled to her opinions, but harping upon it, will not make you change your mind on your own opinion. 
My brother is now 13 he's been diagnosed with PPD and on autistic spectrum but he has excelled so much in the past few years he's one of the smartest kids I know last night my mom texted me he broke her glasses on purpose at first his response was he didn't like or love anyone then it was he loved everyone but he doesn't and never liked my mom he's always been a mommys boy but since hitting puberty and testosterone now a factor my mom was prepared for same response wen I was his age the I hate you phrase but she and even my brother doesn't understand or know how to answer my mom why he would say he doesn't like her or never has he's sweet and caring funny and smart but he's asking me for advice and I'm not so sure what to say I need advice for him to see either people who have gone through it with someone they know or have themselves thank you for any advice
I'm sorry, all I know is that having autism is hard. Emotions are different, and are tough to understand for people with this condition I think. I have autism in my too and I've heard things like 'I hate you' and 'your my best friend' from the same person all within an hour. 

If you are still having trouble I would suggest asking your mom if you and your brother can talk to a counsellor thay can help you further if you don't have that already. 
Backstory: Since I came into the family my husband's brother and wife have been nothing but mean to me. Primarily because the wife hates me and she makes her husband's life a living hell because she complains about me all the time, so he doesn't like me either. They have been trying to compete with us non-stop with everything and anything they can think of, wedding, having kids before us, trying to buy a house before us, etc. This has been going on for years. I believe it's envy, because at every one of our milestones, they've never been happy for us, just critical. But for theirs (them having kids, marriage, etc.) we've been very supportive and loving. There was a point in time when I finally told them that the wife was being mean to me, and to stop, but she somehow managed to  play the victim card and ultimately blame them not participating in family activities on me because "I'm so mean to her". I apparently am the bane of their existence. Luckily for me, the rest of the family knows that she is this way, and that she deliberately tries to go out of her way to be mean to me. However, they just keep telling me to ignore her, but I'm at the point where I can't ignore being bullied anymore. 

I'm at my wits end Reddit, what should I do?
I have had many such people in my life. No matter how well you do, they're never going to be truely happy for you. unless of course you've gone grovelling to them for advice, followed it to the letter and achieved LESS than them using their own advice.

You don't need her or her approval.

Such people eventually fail with family. If her husband is too stupid to have seen her selfish and narcissistic tendencies so far, sounds like they will remain unhappily married for some time.

Worse still, such people do an incredibly poor job of raising kids. Once the kids are grown up, she's not going to have a great relationship with them. Or even a good relationship with them. She'll be lucky if they talk to her once a month and at family funerals.

So all I can say to you is to live your life happily.  Ignore her if you can. Cut her out of you must. But be assured that in 10 or 15 years all she's going to have is a bunch of pushover fair weather friends and not a single meaningful relationship. (And of course you to tell her "Ha. It's all your own doing. You should have been less of a narcissistic bitch. I told you so...")
Ignore her or cut her out. If she makes family events unbearable then don't go. If the family complains explain you are done being harassed . Although, I suspect people like this will feel they have won if they succeed in driving you off. If she is mean to you then walk away. You don't have to put up with her rudeness and everyone already knows she is being a jerk. It is up to you how you handle it. I would ignore it. People like her are pathetic.
People like that are just toxic. If everyone else sees her for what she is and ignores her, then you should too. Why isn't your husband defending you is what I want to know? Why does he let these people abuse you? Sounds like a wuss to me. Maybe you should just leave that whole family behind.
I've probably read this over a dozen times because it's one of the best things that make me feel at ease about this whole situation. I see some of what you mentioned is already happening and it feels better. As of recent she lashed out at my sister calling her names, and when my sister called her out she played the victim card, lied about it, and said we were ganging up on her. So reading this over and over calms my nerves about it.
Wuss yes my husband is VERY non-confrontational. I wouldn't want him to get involved anyway. But she is very toxic.
I was a pretty messed up teen/young adult and have only just managed to get my life back together. I met someone who has made me happier than I have ever been, and more confident than  I have ever been. Since the beginning of my relationship (atleast from when I told them about it) my Mother & Sister have been treating me like I don't exist, making snide comments aimed at me, and creating all sorts of drama that has taken a massive toll on not only my relationship, but on my entire self worth. They have blatantly denied that this is happening, and I have tried to be calm and explain how I am feeling and what it is doing to me, and when they fail to acknowledge that, I have completely exploded and yelled and cried and ended up making myself look like a fool, which has meant that their behavior looks justified. I don't know what to do or where to go for advice... I am confused, upset and angry. I feel like I have nobody I can trust with what has been going on. 
You just have to work out tactics to deal with coping. I don't know them well but it sounds like they know your buttons and press them in the hope of getting a rise out of you. From what you're saying it seems to work often . 

Would it be lovely if they could just treat you like a human/ family member/ friend? Sure. But you can't change then so it's about you dealing with the tough emotions and learning to ignore them. 
Maybe it is time to limit your contact with them. You don't need negativit in your life. Just because they are family doesn't mean they are allowed to treat you like this.
Disclaimer: am not a therapist and therapy might be helpful for you.

I have similar self worth problems, albeit with different sources of negativity that bring it down. One of my goals in therapy these days has been focusing on relying less on other people for my self worth, and it sounds like that might help you too. People can be really shitty, and it's especially hard when it is family, but we can't control the behaviour of others. 

You've talked to them, and I would continue to assertively tell them when you feel you arent getting what you need from your family (specifically and immediately). But they may or may not be open to that.

I don't know you strange Internet person but you are most likely an interesting person who has lots to be proud of. Recovering from a messed up childhood is hard! Don't let unconstructive bullshit damper your self worth. Let it be water under the bridge.
I am by no means an expert on the subject, but I have been through a similar experience. I grew up as the oldest kid in my family and well, in my case I was never out late or doing stuff that my parents didn't want me to or anything. I had a few friends but enjoyed staying at home mostly and I shouldn't say I got depressed but well, I was a bit sad from time to time. But when I moved out from them and a few months after that moved in with my SO, I started to notice things.

1) I got happier than I've ever been before. It wasn't easy building a relationship (noone told me so I didn't know what to expect) but it's still standing today and it's the thing I value most in my life.

2) My parents were fine with me moving out (due to studies) but did not approve of me moving in with another. This was the first time in my life that I was really arguing against my parents and it took about 4 months for me to convince them.

That time was horrifying for me. I couldn't understand that the first time in my life I was taking a decision on my own, my own parents moved against me...? Now I see that they really just wanted me to not do anything stupid because they cared for me, but at the time this was really hard and the result was that I didn't come home to visit them very often. I still believe that they handled it the wrong way - they never told me just "You can't do this!!" but rather "Well son, we think it's lovely you've found someone... but we think... (*deep sighing*) maybe..." etc. My mother especially has always been a kind person but when it came to this she started to talk very passive aggressively to me and it wasn't about what she said. It was how she said it. I don't think she ever told me straight out that she didn't approve of my relationship (and to this day I regret that I didn't confront her about it at once) but everytime we spoke she "pushed buttons" like mothers knows how to do to upset me. I don't know if she did it consciously but it hurt me pretty bad and didn't help me at all.

It would have been better if she made it clear from the start like "Ok son I don't like what you do" and I would go "Ok mother I'm sorry but this is my life, I'm grown up and I will do it" and then we could go on still respecting each other. But that never happened really. This was 3 years ago. I have tried a couple of times to talk openly to both my parents, and to them one at a time, but they (mostly mum) don't recognize the problem. Today I have a better relation with both parents and I've learned to not let my and my mother's bad choices influence my daily life too much. But it still hurts, and I feel bad everytime I talk to my own mother just as awkwardly as I would talk to a stranger. I tell myself to mind my words and remember that what she does to hurt me is not a conscious decision from her side, so I have no right to blame her. Not to say that it's not tough though, but I'm working on it. My SO has been a huge support for me during this time and I try my very best to never let the negativity created by me<->mother influence me<->SO. In the beginning I failed over and over, today I can do it. That's kind of a bottom line through the latest 10 years of my life really. Bad things happens and you can't stop that, but try to never let a single bad thing influence another thing - at least isolate it.

I'm sorry for long text and I'm not sure if this helps you in any way at all. If so: I'm glad, if not my bad. I just wanted to share my story.
I was terrified of my mom when I was growing up. My dad was always the nice one. Every Saturday morning he'd stand in our doorways and lecture us about yard work until the entire afternoon had gone by and no one had done any yard work, but that's about it. My mom terrified me though. She was so passive-aggressive, stayed mad for hours after she became mad about something, screamed at us, accused us of lying and other things we didn't do...I don't remember a lot of specifics but I know I had some reason to be afraid of her. 

I turned 18 in October 2010 and she instantly stopped telling me what to do. We've had very few arguments since then, but I continued to have nightmares about fighting with her. I moved out about 11 months ago and I think I've finally just about stopped having those dreams. Last night I had a dream that she flipped out on me because I went on a trip without her, which is what made me think of this topic. When I wake up, the fight in the dream never seems that important, but while I'm dreaming, I'm terrified. It's just weird. Anyone else have an experience like this?
I haven't lived with my parents in years and I still have nightmares about my dad. trauma takes a long time to get over
I got the best big bro in the world
tl;dr:  I want to be a single Dad.  What have been your experiences?  

Hey r/family.

Throwaway because this is more of a serious post I've decided to open up about.  I have yet to talk to my own friends and family about this because I want unbiased opinions.

I'm at 36 year old singer who's had a very successful  career.  I've toured the world, been on Broadway and worked in TV and Film for over a decade.  I've seen the highs and felt the lows and have learned how to navigate both to have a stable happy and carefree life all while being in arguably one of the most difficult career paths one can hope to have.   

For most of my 20's I've heard from my friends and family how lucky I am and I never took it for granted.  It was a fun decade.  Then I noticed a lot of the people I grew up with were getting married, having kids, putting roots down.  I tried having relationships, but the people you meet in my industry aren't as accustomed to the kind of things you need for that american dream life and the people outside of it don't understand the commitment the sacrifice and the schedule associated with the industry. 

Needless to say, this makes it very difficult for one to find a partner in life with the same goals and patience required to have a successful marriage and family life. 

A good amount of people in the "normal" world think what you have to do to stay viable in the entertainment industry is kind of crazy and obsessive, and to some extent it is.  To be able to reach a certain level of success in any industry requires a little but of an obsession, but I digress.

On the flip side, a good amount of people in the entertainment industry also find the things you need to do to have a successful family life are also odd. The sacrifice, the compromise, the commitment.  

So what you have are two very lucky lives fighting for your attention and that creates conflict.

I decided since I can't find someone on the same page as me, I was going to do it myself.  It's something I've wanted my whole life and I'm not willing to let one thing derail the other.  So i'm going to work my ass off to get it.  

I'm giving myself 5 years (give or take depending on any booms that happen) to set up a nest egg before I go ahead and decide how I want to bring a child into my life to raise.  I wanted to start gathering information here and ask any single parents about what challenges you face, what hurdles you didn't see coming and anything pertaining to having your own home and children to take care of while maintaining your careers.  

I first had this thought in 2009 but wrote it off as just a knee jerk reaction to a failed relationship.  Yet here we are in 2016 and it's still something I constantly think of.  

So I welcome any opinions, criticism, personal stories, and all of the above.  
Do it. There are so few reasons not to and so much joy to be gained. 
Not an actor/singer or single parent, but I'm a parent with a successful/demanding career (in academia), and happen to have a lot of friends in the music industry who are also parents.  

One thing to consider is issues like childcare. If you have this very demanding schedule, and you are a single parent, who is going to be watching your kid?  Day cares do not have night hours that musicians often play, or the insanely early morning hours that actors are known to have, so you will likely have to hire someone to live with you full time to be a nanny in order to manage all that, or potentially a team of people, unless you plan to work only very occasionally. Another possibility is having other family around. But you will need some sort of support network, whether paid or family.   So that's a consideration as well...living with a nanny and your kid is a very different life style vs. it just being you and your kid, so when you are picturing this scenario in your head, add a nanny. 

Also, if you travel a lot to go to movie sets or on tour or whatever, will you bring your kid/nanny with you? Most of my musician /music industry friends who go on tour have a partner who stays at their home base with their kids, and will only bring them to local shows or the occasionally big trip over school break or something.  Another possibility is boarding school during the year and touring with you over the summer...this in part depends on how often you are touring, and distance from where you are living.  

This won't be as important when they are young (if you are adopting though they may not be THAT young) as babies can actually be pretty adaptable in my experience, but once they get to school age they will want to be going to school regularly with your friends, and stability at that age will be good for them too. 

This is why you see singers do things like get a regular gig in Vegas or Miami...apart from the regular money, it's the stability they can give their kids, and the ability to see them every day.  Cause you WILL want to see them every day, as much as you love your career.  My kid stays home with my stay at home spouse, and I have the ability to "work" from home at least 3 days a week (but not really,  if I want to be as productive and successful as I am) so as much as I love my job and love being great at my job, it can be a bummer, especially when my schedule gets really busy as it inevitably does at times, and I can only see her awake for like a half hour or something a day. 

So yeah it's hard to say more without knowing more details about how much you travel, whether you earn enough to be able to afford that type of help.  But do I think you should do it? Fuck yeah! Having a kid is pretty much the most awesome thing ever.  Just go in with your eyes open, and have a plan..cause with parenting you definitely cannot wing it. 
That's what I keep hearing! 
This is exactly the kind of answer I was looking for! 

I like the idea of a nanny for those first years. I have a sibling that looked into it and  affordability won't be an issue. I have friends who have traveled with their babies too and it was great for them.  

I have a lot of connections in big cities where I can do a long sit down when it comes to that age with schooling. 

The more I talk about this and look deeper into the nuances of child raising and what to expect from a growing child, the more fun it seems. Before it was just something I wanted to have because it's how I was raised (I have a big family), but now it not only seems like it's going to fulfill my life goals but be an awesome adventure in the process! 

Thanks for the articulate and informative answer man! 
Yeah actually my friends' kids who went on tour always seemed to be having a blast, and grew up more "Worldly" and savvy I would say.  And the ones who are now adults are definitely doing well and seem pretty well adjusted. At a certain age traveling can be a nightmare though..like age 2-3 when they are really mobile and defiant but don't yet really understand language and why they shouldn't be trying to kill themselves. :)  But yeah, I was hesitant about having kids when I was younger (in part cause I thought it meant sacrificing my career) but it is so much fun!

And your welcome! From a lady ;) 
Thanks, lady! ;) 
My parents are in their mid to late sixties now.  But in my mind they still feel like they are in their mid to late 40s or something.  They still act quite young - my mom just entered retirement but my dad is still working (though a reduced load, he is a farmer).  They go south for winters for a few months every year in a truck and really large fifth wheel.  

But they are aging.  And I feel weird about it.  It makes me really sad to see lots of articles about healthy people dying at ages like 78 or 79 and then I think how I might only have 10-15 more years with my parents, if I am lucky.  And that makes me horrified and sad.

I suffer disability and still receive financial contribution from my parents due to my inability to work, though I am getting healthier and am in university again to do a career that I am able to do with my disability.  After my disability I was unable to perform my previous job.  I still feel very much like my parents are my support network.  Maybe I am being incredibly childish, but I don't know how to evolve.  Especially because I lack friends, my parents are basically my best friends and the only friends I have that would check in on me if I went missing.
Your parents are going to get older and there is nothing to be done about it. You really do need to get out there and make friends. You don't say what your disability is, but if you can work you need to be able to find a way to support yourself because your parents can't always take care of you. Part of being an adult is learning how to stand on your own two feet. I hate seeinget my parents get older too. I worry about them, but I have other parts of my life. I will hurt, but I will be able to go on without them. It is best to figure that out now and not have to do it when you are stressed and hurting.
I am working on supporting myself - I am getting a degree in computer science and hope to work in the programming field upon graduation.  I am very positive and sure that I will find some type of position suitable.  Until then, they help me out with finances while I attend school.  

My disability is schizoaffective bipolar.  I was having voices and psychosis so bad that I could not function or comprehend daily life.  Through therapy and medication I have found acceptable treatment and am starting to be able to live a normal daily life.  My disease tries to make the world a fantasy world, that I live in some type of movie (though a depressing one where it wants me to be a hooker and a drug user and homeless).  It twists reality and basically makes everything awful.  The medication keeps the voices away mostly, and therapy helps me deal with the rest of it and learning to process what is real and what isn't real.

Thank you for your advice.
You are doing all you can and that is great. I think the biggest thing is building a support system that isn't just family and that is hard for a lot of people. I have issues with it myself. You have a challenging disability and so needing your family is understandable and necessary. Computer science is great and there are some great opportunities out there. Myou husband is a developer, and his job has given him some flexibility, like working from home, that has helped us out a lot. It isn't bad to need family, especially when you need a way to stay grounded. 

One thing that helps me when things seem overwhelming is to break up goals into separate, doable tasks. You can't get it all done at once, but you can start working on things in steps and accomplishing goals can give you confidence and keep you on task. 

Best of luck. If you ever need to talk I am here any time :)
Thank you!
My cousin's family lived with us for quite a few years while my aunt went to school to get a better job. My [18/m] cousin and I have grown close, we're practically brothers.

Recently, after my aunt got back up on her feet, she accused my father of spying on my [16/f] cousin in the shower. So, they got in an argument with my mom, who then kicked them out.

They then proceeded to contact the police about things that supposedly happened years ago while they were living here: innapropriate touching, leaving porn for them to see, etc. I honestly have no clue if these things are true, but it's my dad, he wouldn't do that kind of thing.

Well, the police came and got my dad today for questioning, and now my parents know my [18/?] cousin said these things and now they dont want me going to their house. This is very confusing.. because he's my best friend... but he said those things (whether true or not) and this could really send my family downhill.

 I really don't know what I'm looking for by posting this... but I'm just kinda fucked up in my head right now and I don't know what to think or do.
How old are you?  Are you over 18 yourself or right around that age?

Things will probably be awkward with your cousin yeah.  But on the other hand, as an adult, having had a lot of family drama myself, I try to approach each person as an individual and have a relationship with THEM based on how they treat ME, rather than get sucked into drama between other members of my family and not associate with people because they are closely related to other people I have drama with, or because my parent's or brothers are having drama with them.  For instance I have a cousin whose mom (my aunt) has been completely awful to me because she's a racist cuntloaf and we are not on speaking terms (me and the mom) but me and the cousin are still pretty close and we just don't talk about her mom ever or anything about that.  My brother who I am very close with is not on speaking terms with my grandmother, but I am. And we're adults, so we can hang out without our parents. If you are 18 or close to 18 soon enough you will be doing that with your cousin too. 

You may want to talk to him about it to clear the air or just avoid the topic entirely, but it sounds like what is happening is between your father and other members of the family, and while your first impulse is to take his side, if you don't know what really happened, you can also choose to stay out of it. But know that that may cause drama with your parents (especailly if you live with them) so you may want to avoid having your cousin over to your house, telling them you are going to hang out with him, etc.
The problem is you don't know what happened. You want to support your loved ones, but you don't want to be wrong. It is an awful spot. People can hide pieces of themselves that are dark and twisted. We don't want to believe they are capable of such things. Maybe your dad isn't. Maybe your cousin'so mom is the one behind this. Until you know for sure I would be reserved on the matter. I wish I had better advice.
I know I ask for a lot of advice but I really need it! This post is going to be sort of long, but I have been waiting for the right time to submit this so bear with me. 
I (19F) am a triplet, and when I was super young one of my brothers was diagnosed with Tourette's, later as Autism. My entire life has been dictated by my brother. I can't cough. I can't sneeze. I can't say certain words. I can't touch my face or scratch my nose. I cannot do anything! We are going to be 20 in 3 months and he has gained ZERO control over his condition because my mom simply sticks up for whatever he says. An example would be, I was just having a normal conversation with my mom and this brother, and I said something that made my brother mad, so he chucked a water bottle at my head. But then my mom said it was my fault for winding him up, when all I had done was say a sentence to him.
That is the brother situation going on.
The mom situation going on is I attend college and live there as well. I have been growing to be more independent. She will text me every single day, while I am studying. If I do not answer, she will threaten to come to my school and pick me up. She will ask me what I am doing, and whatever I am doing she has something negative to say about. Last semester, she disowned me a few times because I was dating a boy, and I am still dating him. I got a promotion at work and she wants me to give it up. She said if I don't work less then she will disown me, yet I am the only one of us 3 that is actually passing college.
When I am home, my mom asks me to do simple tasks for my autistic brother, that he can do himself. I have to pick up his stuff, clean his laundry, clean his dishes, etc. Today my other brother even cleaned the autistic's one room! If I don't comply to the demands then my mom will follow me around calling me terrible names, hitting me, etc.

I feel like my confidence is just degraded. I don't feel like a good person because my mom and brother crucify me left and right. I feel like such a slave when I am home, but if I complain about it, or even try to maturely talk about it, my mom will completely degrade me. She claims I am the problem and that I need more respect for this family. Tonight I tried watching a movie with my mom and the autistic brother....that ended with my mom yelling at me for going to get a slushie with my boyfriend, and the autistic one threatening to throw ice packs at me. 
When I wake up in the mornings when I am home, I am expected or asked to do all these things. I don't mind helping out the family but I am expected to make breakfast for my grandparents (That's ok), but also make food for the autistic one. I am asked to go get things if my mom and brother "don't feel like it". There have been times when I will be switching laundry at 4 in the morning because my mom didn't want to. I tried confronting her about that and she screamed at me. Today I got in trouble for relaxing in my room all day. But if I went downstairs, I was yelled at or asked to do something for someone. 

I just don't feel like I am part of this family, nor do I want to be. I would like to move out and not contact them a whole lot for a while. I feel like I need space but they smother me. I just want to have a normal family. A family that talks to each other. A family that respects. I hate coming home. 

There is so much more to this story but this is basically the summary. There is so much to tell that I cannot even think of it all. Giving these situations what would you do? My mom wants my autistic brother to live with me someday but I will not allow that. He is capable of doing things by himself. I have seen him do it and he has even admitted to getting away with being lazy. I don't want to really be all that involved in my family for the simple reason of how they treat me. I merely get respect from them at all.  I get hit, things thrown at me, and called names on a daily basis. If I am at school, it's through text and calling.

I just need advice!! Thanks!

*I do not think I am above chores but I would literally be doing chores until 4 in the morning. That is when I would just help at my own because this place is literally a giant mess.

Leave the house, now.
You are in a abusive situation!
This is eactly like my BF! Like, it's so point for point I thought I was reading a old post of his!
LEAVE NOW, LEAVE NOOOW! Report your mother after you gather video evidence! I'm going to lead more redditors here immediately, and we'll do what we can to help(with your perm.)

The worst sign here is the dismissal. It sounds light, but read close and think it over guys...
I remember until I heard and saw my BF being abused(I was hiding in the home, long story...) and I saw him cowering(his supportive[the only difference here, his brother and sister love him dearly] siblings holding close) I realized that the hitting and chores was a lot worse then I thought it was.
I heard him get screamed at, he told me about getting stabbed and slapped and beat, and I watched the guy get screamed at for making a wonderful dinner for his family by that fat BITCH[sorry, I hate his mom so much...I've had to be around her in the daytime, and ever since then I've felt so much hatred toward the woman...)
Hello, I noticed the other comment saying to just leave, but please do not leave the house without knowing your resources.

Search up local resources such as shelters that can help women who are experiencing similar things as you.  Not having a plan and just getting up and leaving may backfire because it can cause more stress if you are unable to find shelter, food, and other necessities.

And of course, please please please do not take advice from reddit so seriously. (Yes even mine, because I am not a professional)  Seek out resources from school.  As an adult, most resources you are eligible for must remain confidential, so do not worry about your mom finding out. 

Good luck! 
Time will teach you.

•	I met a girl. She became my friend. Then my lover. Then my best friend and my lover. I thought we would marry one day.

o	Now we don't speak anymore

•	I know a boy. We played in school. We were inseparable. As brothers. Time passed. We changed.
o	Now we don't speak anymore

•	I met a man. We travelled together. 6 weeks. 18-24 hours a day, 7 days a week we spent together. He knows my darkest secrets. Our travels finished
o	Now we don't speak anymore

•	I had a friend. We lived together for 2 years. We used to laugh a lot. We left university. We had the best of intentions to keep close. Life got in the way
o	Now we barely speak anymore

I met a boy. We don't speak so often. Not every day, sometimes not even every week. Time will pass and we will drift, apart then together, apart than together; caught in an eternal drift. 
•	He knew the girl that was my lover
•	He knew the boy I was my play mate
•	He knew the man I travelled with
•	He knew the friend I lived with
He's seen them come. He's seen them go. He'll see them come, he'll see them go.

That boy is my brother

in my experience, once the parents pass away, the siblings drift apart. In my family, there was always that "base", the family home, where we would see each other frequently whilst visiting the parents. once that base is gone , it's really hard. some siblings make the effort . some don't . out of my nine brothers and sisters , I have one sister that I speak to daily and see weekly, the others only at weddings christenings and funerals.

--- getting that last run with my son, to be alone on the mountain - well that to us was special. A moment, I will always remember. 

It's MLK Weekend 2016 and we arrive at Pico with family and friends, to enjoy winter  and time together.  Surprised to see Ray's twin and equally surprised to see The Thrasher, and enjoying our time with him. 

Having the opportunity to witness that unforgettable time when our niece learned to ski, and seeing brothers cherish new moments on the last run of a great day!

Nothing beats waking up to fresh morning snow, knowing what fun the day had to bring. With the kids all ready, with knee deep stashes and tracked out powder, we all had loads of fun: on chair lifts up, on powder runs down, with time spent with mom and warming up by the fire.

With the kids all in the lodge and the sun now shining, us mom's took a summit run.  With Kirsten showing the way, it felt like a different day. With our friend Jenny following, Kirsten found an open glade.

My boys headed up and to our son's excitement; they had the trail all to themselves, our son shared the last run of the day with dad. Unexpectedly being the last ones off the mountain

These are the the days to Embrace........


Sounds like you guys made some amazing memories :)
3 months ago, my wife and I were watching my sister-in-law's dog, a usual occurrence given she picks up extra at work all the time. Towards the end of the evening, her dog walked back into the Living Room and sat down on the couch next to me. Within a few seconds, I smelled dog poop. I told my wife so, and instantly looked at the SIL's dog and traced the smell to my soon-to-be-born son's nursery. He had done this in this room before, the first time being the first day we moved into the house (we watch him quite frequently). I cleaned the mess off one of the baby blankets and walked downstairs. 

When walking past our spare bedroom, I smelled dog urine, so I inspected once again. Long story short, I ended up finding 3 wet urine spots and 5 more dry older spots in the room. After 4 bottles of pet urine odor carpet cleaner, the smell persisted. I called a carpet cleaning company and had the carpets cleaned professionally, the smell persisted. I used 4 more bottles of cleaner and scrubbed the carpet for an hour myself and now the room no longer smells of urine, but of cleaner. Good enough for me, for now. I could only smell the dry urine spots if I knelt down and smelled the carpet so I checked all over the entire house. Thats when I found at least 5 more dry urine spots in less traveled rooms or corners of our house.

My reaction to all this was to tell my SIL that her dog is no longer allowed back into our home. He is a habitual territory marker, having urinated in other people's homes previously and I do not want urine stains, smells or bacteria in my home and on my carpets that my son will be crawling on.

My SIL's response? She no longer wants to visit my wife or my son and mentions cutting us out of her life entirely, because if her dog isn't allowed in our home, we obviously "don't love her and want her in our lives". This has been going on for 2 months now, and she refuses to visit our family or talk to me unless I allow her dog to come with her. She has even brought her dog over without asking after I told her he is not allowed back, I was not happy. 

I guess my question is... **Am I wrong here? Is my request for her dog to no longer come into our home too much? Am I being unreasonable for not giving in and allowing the dog back in our home?** This is stressing my wife out, she only wants my son to know his aunt and is very close to her entire family.


A few bullet points I didn't want to bore you all with:

* SIL works 50+ hours a week and always brought her dog to our home (but oddly never to anyone else's home), saying she will not leave him home alone after being at work all day. 

* We have a dog also (8+ years), but we have never and currently don't have issues with him going in our apartments/this home. 

* When we watch SIL's dog and are at work, both dogs were free to roam the house

* This may sound strange, but after 8 years, I know my dog's urine smell, and this wasn't my dog

* We almost never use this spare room, so the door is usually slightly cracked open, but almost never even entered
No. You aren't being unreasonable. Your sil is being unreasonable. She is pushing back because she has to find an alternative for her dog and it is inconvenient. Too bad. Her dog is causing trouble. I am guessing she didn't offer to pay for the damage and/or claimed you couldn't know that it was her dog and not yours. Setting boundaries is healthy and people push back because they don't like change. It always gets worse before it gets better. Ignore her. Don't give into her tantrum. If she comes over with the dog politely tell her she is welcome in, but has to leave the dog outside. You shouldn't have to sacrifice your home for her convenience.
She didn't offer to pay for the cleaning upfront, but one time since all this happened she asked us to watch him again in an pinch. I agreed on the condition that it was a one-time emergency situation and she would pay for the cleaning. She agreed and said she would but hasn't brought it up or reimbursed us and I highly doubt she ever will. But you can be sure I still watched the dog.

My poor wife is crying over all this because she feels like her family is being ripped apart. She thanks me for looking out for her and our son but wants me to cave in and I give her sister what she wants. I honestly just can't morally do that, for multiple reasons. Namely:

* I don't want my home defiled
* I do not want to put my child in a situation that could affect his health potentially
* I refuse to give in to my SIL like her family has done all her life

Some background: My SIL is literally a spoiled brat who holds her breath until she gets what she wants, and to me, that is no way for a 27 year old to carry herself. It may not be my responsibility to teach her a lesson, but I do feel that I reserve the right to refuse to encourage such behavior within my own home.

I just wish this wasn't so difficult for my wife... :(
I completely understand and figured she was a brat based on how you described her. She is being a jerk and if you budge it will never get better. I know this is hard on your wife. Maybe it would help if you made a plan. Agree to hold your ground for 2 months. After two months you two can talk about either continue the course of find a different way, for example, the dog can come over, but only stay outside.
Me 26
GF 23
Daughter 4

So my girlfriend wants me to meet her daughter soon, I'm happy that she wants me in her little girls life, we haven't been together long, but her and I have been very close friends for two years. 

How do I interact with her daughter? I mean what do I say? I'll be meeting her parents to, but I mean do I go up to her daughter when she introduces me and say what comes to mind? I'm actually pretty nervous. The daughter is the splitting image of her mother, and just as beautiful. 

I mean do I say "Hello (Childs name) I'm (my name)" and leave it at that? Do I lower myself to her height so she doesn't feel intimidated? Do I tell her she's as beautiful as her mother? I really don't know how to interact with a girlfriends child, I've never been in a relationship with someone With a child and don't know how to interact.

So any advice is needed please!

Thank you
Maybe start by trying to be her friend. At that age it is had to tell how well the child is at communicating. My kids would have hid behind me and not said a word to a "stranger". Just say hi and play it by ear. Maybe get a little info from the girlfriend about the kids likes and dislikes, it will give you something to talk about with her. 
At that age there's a wide variance on what to expect, every kid is different. She might be shy, maybe not, just be friendly and open and see how it goes.
Alright so I'm just asking this question out of curiosity and am not even sure if I'm posting this in the correct subreddit

So I'm a little nervous as you can probably tell. Right so every once in a while I'll see a single parent post on reddit asking a question about how their GF or bf is jealous of their child or it'll be the kid posting about it. I guess my question is why do these parents settle for somebody who'll be jealous of their child or who'll treat the kid badly when there's somebody out there who can accept their full package?   I mean I've seen some good step dad's/bfs  out there( I don't know any step mom's). My friends dad (her step dad) treats as if she's one of his own and. my mom's ex bf was really good to me and he always bonded with me as if I was his own so I don't get those people who are jealous of their s.o.'s child. In my opinion, that behavior is petty but I'm just a 17 year old so what do I know? 

But in all seriousness why do single parents even settle for someone like that?  If I were to ever become a single parent I would want someone who was like the great step dad's/boyfriend's I've known.
I wish I knew the answer to that. I think it boils down to people being afraid of being alone. They settle because they think they can't do better or they think the person will change. They blind themselves to the truth because they want everything to be okay. It is sad for everyone involved. This is just what I have observed. I am married and have kids and I can't imagine dating someone who wasn't good to my kids. They are my world. Parents have a right to be happy, but they should also protect their kidd and put their well being first.
In one particular case, my childhood friend, it's because she has horrible self esteem, is afraid of being alone, and has some "life goals" she wants to achieve no matter what...and frankly she's always had absolutely horrible taste in men.

He son's father was an abusive piece of shit. She had the kid too young. Guy bailed and is banned from reentering our country because he tried to smuggle drugs. Her current boyfriend treats her like shit, doesn't want her son around his son (because her son has behaviour problems), and isn't really a good catch.

She desperately wants to be married (and have another kid) and I don't think she really cares who it's with.

It's hard in my country: there aren't a tonne of eligible bachelors (as most young educated people get educated overseas and either meet their future spouse out there and being them home or stay overseas)and the dating pool is incredibly small (you have a lot of cousins in our small, isolated country).

Her son is going to be so fucked up. She puts him second, she cares a lot about what other people think and want them to like her: she will put him down "as a joke" and tease him (ie make him feel self conscious about something totally normal)...about in I don't know...about a million other little things. Her family was fucked up too. It's such a shame she's continuing the cycle because he does seem like he could be a sweet kid. He's 9.
I wish I knew as well but the way I see it, I wouldn't settle for someone like that when I know there's somebody out there that is good and I want a good relationship with my future kids so I wouldn't want to settle and put that relationship at risk just because someone is jealous of my time with them.
I feel real bad for her son and I think some people need to take care of themselves wat before they decide to have kids.
I agree. The issue is people are good at deceiving themselves sometimes and can't always see a situation for what it is.  They want everything to be okay so they convince themselves that it is. 
I think so too maybe they just want reasons to hang on because they can't believe someone who's treating them so good can be that bad.
This is a long one and I need some understanding. 

I'm 19 in my second year in university. I'm paying for my education on my own with the help of student loans, grants and my part time job. My parents were refugees from Vietnam and because they moved to Canada with nothing it's only natural that there is no savings for my education. 

The thing is, with my deadbeat dad gambling all the time, and my mother being the only one who works full time to pay the bills and mortgage and debt,  I want to help out. Seeing my mom stress so much about making ends meet makes me so upset. But recently because of Lunar New Year my mom felt bad that I was not able to go with them to a family gathering to celebrate since I had midterms and projects and gave me $40. I didn't accept it, left it on the table and now it's missing. I looked everywhere, firmly telling her that I did not take it but offered to pay her back. Now both my parents are criticising me for even suggesting "paying them back" and are deeming me as naive. I didn't want to take my mom's hard earned money in the first place, I tell her repeatedly that I don't need it simply because it's so painful to see her stressing about finances. I know I don't have much considering I have student debt myself but I want to take full responsibility for my own education. I know it was stupid of me to just leave the money like that, but why won't they take my money? 
No matter how old you get your parents will always see you as a child. They provided for you as best they could for as long as they could, that habit isn't going to drop easily. They may feel like they should be able to give you more and are embarrassed that they don't have the means. Sometimes people give gifts to demonstrate their love and support, turning it down can be hurtful for them. Whenever someone gives me something, I always accept without question and thank them profusely, even if I know they can't really afford it. Knowing that people will share what little they have , especially when they struggled to get it demonstrates their feelings towards you. I get around the giving back by deliberately having "spare" things which I give them, asserting they are doing me the favour by taking it off my hands. Example if you notice they need something like new cookware, buy a set , say you got it free along with something else. It's a lie but a good one.   
It sounds like your mom wants to be able to provide got you and is upset she can't. She doesn't want your money because she sees you as her child (regardless of your age) and she wishes she could take care of you. She feels bad she can't afford to take care of you. This isn't anything you did. This is something your parents have to deal with.
Don't take it personally! She wants you to do well in life and the one way parents see that happen for their kids is to provide for them. She obviously loves you very much and sees you giving her your money the same as her taking food out of your mouth. She sounds like a stellar mom to me.


Be sure to pay their kindness forward should you decide to have your own kids some day.
Your mom is lovely. Take the money and buy her something either for the house hold or for herself. A simple mani-pedi. Tell her you want her to go to the store with you and just drop her off. Tell her it has been taken care of. It's the little things that warm a parent's heart.

Or, even better. Open up a separate savings account. Put whatever extra money like that into an account for the fam. Make this an emergency fund :)
Coming out as transgender and a victim of incest and molestation has literally isolated me completely from my family. I'm searching for something that will stop all this hurting because I'm literally just not capable of anything right now.
I am so sorry for all you have been through. I wish I knew what to say to help ease your pain. All I can say is if you ever need to talk, ever, I am here any time. I mean it. 
Thank you so much. I appreciate your kindness. I honestly am looking for help because I don't even know what to do. 

When I little my father beat everyone in house (mom, me, bro) and i was fearing him as he was a god (allah). I wasnt in a harcore muslim family but i guess i can understand how much some people around me fear god. I wasnt in a fear of allah but my fear was god. As a kid a hadnt know mcuh about god or death but the thing what im most scared of is my father, getting beated by him.
But since many years passed and im now 20 and i no longer know a nor fear my father. I realy detest him, he still demands success from me as a scholar. He thinks i am a very capable person about science or he just thinks i can have a better life then his (he is a worker, didnt finish high school [most people didnt at that time but all of my uncles have success exept my father]). He always rages and demand, he likes to show himself more then he is. He even says he could be a successful fotballer if his leg was broken.
He is kinda narcistic and or maybe more but i hate narcist people, as they alwasy get jelaous of people and try to harm them rather then try to be better. So im 20 im getting my stuff together and leave him. I already dont live with him anyways I live in a diffrent city for school for 9 mounts a year. I detest him and i want him out of my life. All he is good for is providing money and he judges rages beats (he cant beat anymore). Thats it guys Ive been a hateful guy over some things as time passed, and now i wanna dump my father. My mother wants to divorce but she says I am only still married to your father because of you need to get to the point where you can take care of yourselves (me and my bro, he is 18). They dont talk to each other, not sleeping in the same bed, the fight time to time and it some times ends up him beating mom. This was more frequent when i was a kid but now we prevent him doing. He sometimes grabs knife but we do what we can to prevent. He wrecked the house PC becuz i play games so much and we fought over this so many times and once i hated that PC so much that i was in a great sorrow and didnt want that thing in my life at that time and i overvolted the PC and burned it, luckyle warranty fixed it. Anyways enough talk, I just want him out of my life and I also i hate Turkey, I wanna leave this country ASAP or just live and rot on streets. I lived my worst year because of him, I was in a place where i did not want to be when i was 15-16 and it was even worse when i was 16 and it was the second year of my school. I had to stay in a dorm room with my arch enemy for 8 mounts. Father was completely unawere of anything and he only cared about my grades. I was to go to a superior school and i thougt it was but thats just because how the think its. 
My parents always said the school in our neighborhood sucks, but i regret so much for going to a even more ignorant place (like i was orthodox and there were mainly katloic people or alevi/sunni so i got mobbed heavly they even made fun of my speaking because i was speaking correctly [went to Sivas from Istanbul]. I was asimilated and preyed 5 times a day. And when the guy wanted me to prey is not preying, and i felt nothing special about preying and left it. People consumed by regligion and treated bad for my regligion and that made me hate it. Now im close to atheist and as i saw my father like a god because he was giving me hell when he beats me and family. So i hate him much really. I see myself as a pet under his care. He feeds me and tends to his own business. Most pets live like 10-20 years and i feel like its my due time so i want to leave.
I am so sorry. Your father sounds very abusive and watching him abuse everyone around you as well as yourself is absolutely horrible. I wish I had good advice for you, but it is hard as the dynamics of where you live are so different than I am used to. Making a plan to leave in a safe way is important. Your mom and brother may push back a little because it will be hard on them, but they need to make the decision to leave on their own. I understand why you want to leave and it sounds like it is for the best. You don't deserve to be treated this way and neither does the rest of your family. Your father is a tyrant and you will never be happy or relaxed until you put distance between you. Some people try to excuse bad behavior and claim that families need to stick together. They are wrong. The fact that he is family makes the way he treats you even worse. It is a betrayal of trust. I am so sorry. I wish I had a good idea of how you should leave, but I agree that you should. If you ever want to talk I am here any time.
Thank you for your comment. I am a video game addict and I see video games as drugs. Do drugs ruin life or drugs are been used because the life is already ruined? As my father countinues to support me as economically. But i know he is not a true friend of mine. He blames video games for my grades and they say: why are you not succesful as X, you are actualy intelligent you can surpass him easily if you study, but i now know that I may not have felt that i should study for myself but them. And i know that i have too leave the burdens behind to be free. Soceity thinks people should get a job then get married, make children etc. and my parents are one of them. That they want me to live the life they think is appropriate. After all financial support from my father and some emotionally support (close to nothing), I dont thing i have to give back him something when I begin to earn money, And he is a pretty money waster guy. All our property is househood. House is rent and no car (had 2 and one accident the other taxes took it).
I cant handle most living situtations as long as mom supports me and she defintely will. She has done some abuse too buy i forgive her for all the care she did and I am sure she is influenced by father. But she has to overcome the idea that she doesnt need to live in the same house with my father anymore. One year and my brother will graduate from high school and then everything will be better I hope. Thanks again for reading and answering.

It was around 2005. My grandfather had recently died from complications from diabetes. My Nana is selling the family homestead and the whole family clan is in town to help with the moving, packing and the huge yard sale. Several years before, all my aunts and uncles moved down south to basically get away from Nana. She was a complete thunder cunt. My mother ended up moving in with them because they were old...they needed a lot of help. They had a 3 acre plot of land with tons of flower and vegetable beds and an 8 floor split level house. 

Anywho. During the yard sale, i overheard a few of my aunts and uncles bad-mouthing my mother...saying she has just been mooching of Nana and Papa and other nasty things that left me somewhat speechless for a while. Finally, i came to my senses and butted in, reminding them of who moved far away and who stayed behind to help. I explained that at any one point in time, my mother held down AT LEAST 2 jobs to help support them...to pay bills, to pay for their medicines, to help keep their car up so she could drive them to doctor appointments, so she could keep groceries in the house and so on. I'm just so mad at them. It's hard for me to get over because i was raised to never, ever go against the family. I just don't know if i'm being foolish for staying mad at them all. But what i heard them all saying just absolutely floored me. 
It sounds like they are awful. Just because they are family doesn't mean it is okay for them to act this way. In fact, it makes it all the worse. You would not be a bad person for not associating with them.
It sounds like you are acting like you were raised:  to never go against family!  You stood up for your mom when she couldn't.  People can be vindictive and jealous.  Thank goodness they do love far away, huh? Good luck and please accept my condolences on your grandfather's passing.  Hope it feels better to get that off your chest. :D
Hi there.

Some background: I’m a seventeen-year-old girl. I have very strict parents. I guess their parenting style has worked in that I am a straight A student who has never been in trouble, but we don’t have much of a relationship. 

Last Saturday one of my friends called me around 2am. She needed a ride home from a party where everyone was drunk.  My curfew is always 9pm, weekend or not, so I wasn’t going to be able to help her out while abiding by my parents’ rules. But I was worried about my friend, so I snuck out, picked her up, and brought her to her house. When I got  home my parents were up and waiting for me. 

I explained why I did what I did, and they said that they believed me and that we would talk about it more in the (later) morning. 

The next day they took away my car keys, my phone, and my computer. I’ll get them back in three months.  I bought my own car and pay my parents the insurance cost, and I pay my phone bill (I work full time over the summer and 10-15 hrs a week during the school year).  The computer was a Christmas gift from them.

They are going to drive me to school and work, but not to rehearsal—so I can’t audition for the play that I had been planning to.  I can use the computer in the family room, but I cannot ask anyone to let me on it if they are already on. I have to wait until it is open (I have two younger sisters who don’t have their own computers, so it rarely is). 

I asked them if they would have given me permission to pick up my friend if I had woken them up, and they said absolutely not (which I figured). 

I’m not feeling especially remorseful. I didn’t want to leave my friend in a bad situation. And my parents didn’t offer any alternative ways that I could have gone about helping her…so I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be learning from all of this restriction. I also feel like the consequences are pretty harsh, given that I have never been in any kind of trouble. It isn’t like this is the start of a downward spiral.  I tried to talk to my parents about it, but they called me ungrateful and my dad just kept repeating “my house, my rules.”  It all feels very unfair—but I cringe every time I think that, because that is what every teenager who has ever been grounded says.

Am I blinded by my ungrateful teenage brain, or are my parents over the top in their parenting?

Td;dr: I snuck out to pick up a friend from a party. My parents took away my phone, car, and computer for two months. Justified?

Your father is right when he says that it's his house, and his rules.

You're right that he's being incredibly harsh on you for something that should not have been a big deal.

Remember that what your father is telling you when he pulls rank like that is that you should work your ass off and get your independence as soon as you can.
Why would your friend not just call a taxi? 
I think that your parents are being incredibly harsh, but I think they are also worries about you. You did the wrong thing for the right reason and you are paying for it. I would try talking to your parents again, but with a bit of a different approach. I would ask them for help with what to do if that situation ever comes up again. You don't want to leave a friend stranded, but you don't want to break the rules. Maybe put a plan into place. 
I'm willing to bet that if you had told your parents that your friend needed a ride home from that party, they would have done themselves, or they would have called her a taxi or something. They might be strict, but they sound like decent people, and they would have understood that she was in a position where she really needed help.

So is their response justified? That's not the word I'd use, but I do get where they're coming from--they're scared. You have to understand that when you're a parent, the idea of your babies driving at all makes you nervous (weren't you changing their diapers just the other day?) and driving at night when you're not awake to worry about them is even worse.

If I were you, I would take my punishment with good grace for now--I have a funny feeling that once they've calmed down a bit, those two months might turn into one month, or even two weeks.
Looking for my estranged sister. I know she currently attends Millersville U. Please up vote in hopes she knows I miss her and love her and am trying to reach out.  Her name is Danille Elliot. Thank you.

I'm not sure I even know where to start. My dad is...He is a terrible parent. While growing up my dad ignored all his children. He favored my sister and brother, when he did actually act to care over me, because I wasn't the child he had to get custody over nor am I a male, I'm female. He never decided to try to understand anything about me. He made it look like when we weren't living here in my grandfather's home that he would call the house we lived in "his house" and not "our house". He's a big wasteful spender and things that giving people stuff will make them like you. Oh and when we did something wrong enough to make him mad he would yell in our faces like he was a drill sergeant (he never was one) and we were fresh recruits. Every time I did it I cried and got so scared of screwing up.

My sister is also terrible. She basicly said I had no life just because I wasn't going out everywhere and doing some of the most stupidest things in the world and I was social on the internet. At least I have lived as the same place as her since 2006. Bad thing is she has kids and like father like daughter, she's a bad parent.

My mom did all she could to make everything work out. I thank her many times for what she could do and she had apologized for things she did in the past that she tried to make better but couldn't. She did try to leave my dad a few times, but with nothing to help her out, not ever her own family, she couldn't get anywhere.

Today I had one of the semi-regular arguments with my dad. After that I went from my normal reaction of wanting to punch him for not even trying to understand me to feeling of sheer terror. We were coming home from the store when this all went down. I stood outside for about 30 minutes not feeling like it was ok to go inside. 

I had some plans tonight which helped, but when I got back. I waited 30 minutes in my friend's girlfriend's car before I went in. I quickly went to my room and stayed there, still scared. I'm still scared hours later and I don't know what to do any more. 
I'm sorry this is happening to you. I totally understand. I had an alcoholic mother growing up and every night was unpredictable  and awful. I felt so anxious going home as I rarely knew what I was walking into. At the time I felt hopeless, but once I got old enough and moved out and was able to disconnect it was the best feeling ever!! It feels like it will never happen but it will. Try to concentrate on the future and how much better life is going to be rather than the present because one day it will be a faded memory. You never mentioned how old you were?
I'm 24 going to be 25. The fear has mostly gone away for now too.
He also did apologize for what he said. It's just...he doesn't think at all about what he says.
Background: when I was eighteen, my (divorced) mom and dad both kicked me out of their houses. I wasn't a bad kid or anything, but my dad thought it was 'time to be a man and get by on your own'. Now, I'm 21 and want nothing to do with either of them. They expect me to come on the holidays and at other times (like weddings and funerals). Why should I? Why don't they just accept the consequences of their actions? 

I'm probably going to change my phone number so they can't call me. I'm so tired of them leaving voice-mails telling me I'm a bad son. I'm tired of being called selfish. I'm tired of them acting like I *owe* them **my** time when they had no problem telling a once-homeless me 'no one owes you a damn thing'. 
Hello Juan :)
Hey it's understandable to feel this way. They threw you out when you didn't want to leave, left you by your own, and had to learn things by yourself the hard way without their support.
And now, out of the blues, they want you to come by and support them/be a "good" son, when they weren't the best parents themselves before.

Obviously, there's a lack of balance in the give and get relationship between you.

If you don't feel like talking to them, resent what they have done to you, then you could do what they have done to you (as you explain here), or (beforehand) explain briefly "you get what you gave (or lack of it in here)" and let them know WHY you refuse to talk to them. Let them know that the final time you talk to them & see their reaction. Give them time. They might think through it and feel regret or they might not. Either ways, you have explained your standing, and have moved on living your life as already are.
Real "good" parents will call you back and attempt to change things. If they did not, let them go. At least you gave them a chance. You tried to do better than them. You tried to be a giver. They stayed the takers. After this, I recommend you to change your number.

It's up to you. I wish you the best!
Keep us updated if you need to talk :)
As an adult, you are the one responsible for making your choices for yourself. "Disowning" family is a difficult thing for almost anyone that has to face it, and now you have to face whether or not to erase the history you have with your family.

I had similar issues with my mother. She ended contact with me when I was a child (my parents divorced) and only talked to me when I was the one that reached out. I went several years without talking to her at all, in fact. Including birthday cards.

After that, once I was in college, I (out of the blue) started to get almost daily calls-all at the same time of day. I accepted and chatted, like a decent person, until I realized what the catalyst was. She had gotten a new job, with a longer commute, and she was calling me to pass the time on the way home from work. 

After this, she visited the state I lived in, to participate in a charity race, and called me only because she needed a ride from the finish line. 

Once I had kids, she began sending packages (presents) to children she had met once and never (respectively). Eventually, I felt obligated to section myself and my family off from a woman I deemed a poor mother and selfish human. So I wrote her a letter and explained my position. It was more about what I needed as an adult than what I felt she did wrong as a parent.

I'm sharing because my experience might help advise yours. Good luck, whichever choice you make.
They aren't entitled to anything. It is your life and your time. If they were supportive emotionally and financially I would tell you to try and make an effort. As they are not supporting you either way I would say that is entirely up to you. They didn't have to kick you out. They could have handled that better. If you want to give them another chance that is your call. If you want to.change your number and never speak to them again that is also your call. I wouldn't fault you for it.
They are not entitled to anything of yours, let along something as precious as your time.

My aunt and I were talking about divorce and she proceeded to tell me that everyone nowadays has been getting the *the big D* and that it was running rampant everywhere. Always with emphasis on "THE BIG D!" Raised eyebrows, upward vocal inflections, and genuinely surprised...every.single.time.

..."and that's what they call it nowadays, Matthew!!" 
On Christmas my little sister and I promised to reserve crying for winning and dying. Today I got hit by a car (not bad) and broke down in the middle of the street with everything that was going on and she said, "Crying is for winning and dying."
Lol! My dad was talking to us and we were discussing having to circumnavigate porn on the search feature of a site we all use. He was saying you could search any word and it would turn up porn. My husband and sister were laughing at me as was hysterically laughing over the mental image of the innocuous words he mentioned.
I may have to "borrow" that line.

I'm also assuming that your tears remain unjustified.
I really don't know if anyone will ever see this, but I'm at a point in my life where I'm trying to figure out some things so I thought I'd give it a try. My Dad and I have this really complicated relationship and I'm not at all sure what to make of it.

First of all, I do love my dad. He's not necessarily a bad parent at all, even though sometimes I find it hard to remember that. He can be funny and nice, but he just has a real problem with expressing emotion I suppose. My parents are still together and I'm very close with them both, especially my mother who's just one of those nurturing, caring people. In fact it seems really easy to her. Just not so much for my dad.

For as long as I can remember he's had this really short temper, always getting worked up and shouty over the smallest things and never taking responsibility for his own actions. He's emotionally repressed. I can't recall a time where he hasn't insulted my appearance and not insisted it was just a joke, no matter how upset I was about it. I remember when I was eight I fell off my scooter and bruised my face, and he then asked me, in front of all the neighbours thinking it was hilarious, which chin I had bruised. I don't think he ever gave a second thought about what that did to me. Over the years he's called me constant names like Fatty Arbuckle and ugly and stupid, insisting he was only doing it for a laugh. 

He treats me like I'm this unreasonable and whiny child, even though I think I put up with much more than anyone else would. If I ever try to argue or stand up for myself I'm 'causing an argument' or I should just 'stop moaning' because how dare I have a single thought in my head. He picks fights with me wherever possible, picking at things he knows full well annoy me. There's never a compromise, he can never be wrong, and whenever he is of course it's going to be my fault. He's the same with my mother and brother as well, but I'm just at a point where I can't take it as well as them anymore. Part of me's even convinced he might have something like Autism he just seems so closed off to emotional norms.

The fact is, this has affected me so much, to the point I'm struggling to find any reason to even talk to him anymore beyond just 'he's my parent. His words and childish actions have had serious consequences over the years. My brother developed an eating disorder and still suffers from health problems because of it, and I've had severe social anxiety disorder for about ten years now to the point last year I found it so hard to leave the house my university took to calling home to find out whether something had happened to me. 

I might not even have thought at all about tackling this in the past, but things have been changing for me recently. I took a year abroad, which is halfway through now, and realised that in the four months I was gone I barely felt sad at all. I barely hated myself or feared leaving the house, or cried or got nervous around people. Not one person insulted me.

 And that's why I feel I'm at a point where I can't ignore the affect he's had on me anymore. I love my dad, but at the same time I feel he's done a lot to ruin my life. I'm twenty, and so far as I'm concerned I've wasted my teen years being crushed under my anxiety and letting it rule me, and I fear that's just something I'll never be able to forgive him for. But then I suppose that I really do want to. I want to love my dad without any barriers, without being reduced to tears whenever he gets abrasive or insults me, but I just think it's going to take so much time, and effort that he seems completely unwilling to put in.

I just wanted to know how many other people have gone through this. There's no way I can be the only one, with a parent who loves and cares for them, but their inability to express that and instead only focusing on the negative emotions destroying a lot of the good. And if you have, have you been able to forgive them? Was it easy? And is the onus just on me to get over it, or is that too unreasonable and should instead fight for this to be a two way street?

I'm just sick and tired of it. I want to keep a relationship with my dad, I just don't know if I'm strong enough for it.
Ok, so Christmas is tomorrow and my mental ass cousin is coming over to my house. What's the issue? Call me whatever name you want but I don't want to see my fucked up family. Let's start, my uncle, which is a drunken wreck hates my ass from past experiences. His wife looks at me in a bad way, and thinks I'm a bad kid, literally doing nothing but asking them to put their dog away while at their house during thanksgiving. Now there kids are about 23-30 and have kids themselves. The mom of my cousin is also a drunken wreck, not giving one fuck if their mental kids are bothering me. The dad is pretty cool, but he's fucked up and doesn't give a fuck if his kids fuck with me.

Having that said, I don't want to see them, and same with them not wanting to see me. Now, my computer is out in the open for them to use. I don't want the to use it, so I came up with the idea to move my computer away where they can't reach it. My parents are bitching about it, so I can't. I'm NOT going to go in the crowd and see them. Call me a selfish bitch, but I'm not going to. 

How do I know my cousins will touch it? Who the fuck wouldn't? Also, I know from past experiences them stealing my shit such as money, but I retrieved it back. What do you think I should do? For me, I'm just fucked. Please I really need help. Oh also, why don't I want them to use it? They broke 2 of my ds's and ripped my money on the spot. They have not grown up considering this happened during thanksgiving. I'm fucked, please what should I do. I'd really appreciate it!!!

It is sad your parents won't let you put your computer in your room. I would take any money and valuables and keep them locked up. You do not have to put up with people being disrespectful of your stuff.

The rest of it you, unfortunately, you just have to learn to deal with. Part of the holidays is spending time with family. You may not want to deal with them, but that is part of the holidays for most of us do your best and be grateful when they leave.
Thank you so much. I might do just that. Happy holidays! I need to realize they are my family, weather I like it or not. Thank you so much :).
what papers do i need to take care of? the house? medical things? financial stuff? what do i do, please tell me.
For yourself, make sure you speak with someone at your college. Given the circumstances, you may be granted a leave of absence without penalty. Perhaps speak to a mental health counselor, academic advisor. In many schools Dean of Students is the top person -- they are there for helping the most serious situations. That should be your first step.

Look into obtaining legal advice through your college for free. You might be surprised at how many services a university offers its students in these circumstances. Usually legal assistance is one.

I'm very sorry for your loss. Please take care, be kind to yourself. Know a new day is always coming and the environment you're in -- school -- can be a refuge in many ways. Stay strong.

:: hugs ::
I am not sure. I just wanted to say that I am sorry for your troubles. You may want to try /r/legaladvice. They may be able to help you. Best of luck.
This also happened to me.  It was terrible.  You can't relate anymore to people your age.  I actually didn't end up functioning well at school and finally got my shit together at 25.  Hopefully there will be assets for you in the end and settling the estate will be worth all of the trouble.  It will have to go through probate which will take at least a year and a half.  There was a good article about this recently in the NY times, it went through each step after someone dies.  It was about a lonely bachelor-will try and find it and post it here if allowed by admin http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/nyregion/dying-alone-in-new-york-city.html?_r=0 Hope I don't sound callous and cold here, you will have a lifetime to work through the sadness and lonliness of your new life as an orphan, but you will also have to put on your new hat as estate administrator too.  I didn't know about any of this either until it happened to me.  Take care Good luck 
I'm so sorry for your losses and pray for peace and comfort and honest counselors to come beside you. 
My son got to meet his great grandmother one time after he was born, she died two weeks after his birth.

Sorry for your loss.  I'm sure meeting your son made her very happy.  
I'm sorry for your loss. It is a nice picture and I am sure your son will appreciate it when he is old enough to understand.
Yes, she sort of knew who he was.

She thought I was my wife's uncle.


I need advice! My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months (have been friends for 2 years) and he has a six-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son. 

This past October my boyfriend lost his old job and got a new one with a different schedule that kind of conflicts with his custody schedule. 

For backstory: His custody schedule is Thursday 7am to Sunday 8pm. 

His old work schedule was Tuesday-Friday 8am-5pm so he had his father watch his kids on Thursday and Friday during his work time and he would watch them the rest of the time.

With his new schedule, he works Friday-Tuesday 7am-6:30pm (horrible schedule) so I agreed to watch his kids Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

The kids and I get along great, we have fun and together we established rules for when they come over such as 'ask before you grab something' 'listen', 'sharing is caring' 'indoor voices' etc. Even though I have no kids of my own, I'm a preschool teacher so I am used to dealing with kids.

The little boy follows the rules easily and reacts well to time-out and consequences. It's the little girl I have issues with. She has a very veeery hard time following rules as simple as saying 'please and thank you'. She always expects a reward for good behavior and announces anytime she is behaving. This is hugely due to the fact that her grandfather spoils her to the max, she has no rules at his house, and minimum rules at her mother's.

Her attitude lately has been really sour, demanding things, and protesting when her brother gets something and she doesn't. 

Last week while their dad was at work, I took them to Target to buy some cheap toys for the boy because he has none at my house (the girl has tons). The girl protested that it wasn't fair that she wasn't getting anything and that she was mad at her brother (she proceeded to push him and taunt him). I called her out and told her there would be consequences if she didn't stop. I explained how she had just gotten new toys from her grandpa last night (a mermaid doll and bath toys) while her brother had gotten none. The grandpa of the kids yells, cusses, severely punishes the boy while he spoils, praises, and continuously compliments the girl.

On our way out of Target, the girl started spinning around on the elevator. I told her to stop and when she did, something fell out of her pocket. She gasped with a guilty/shocked look on her face and the lady in the elevator with us said 'Uh oh! That's not good'. Realizing that what fell out of her pocket was a toy from the dollar section, I immediately grabbed her hand and scolded her in front of everyone. 

I was in complete shock and didn't know how to react. I told her that I was going to tell both her mom and dad and that they were going to decide whether or not to 'call the cops'. I wanted to scare her a little bit without traumatizing her to make sure she understood the severity of her actions.

A couple of weeks ago the little girl told me that her uncle (who lives at the girl's house) told her that if something is out of its packaging at the store, you can take it home. Shocked, I asked her if her uncle took stuff from the store. She said that yes, he steals stuff all the time. I explained that stealing is not ok, that if you get caught stealing you will go to jail and I explained what jail is. She said she wouldn't steal because she doesn't want to go to jail where she won't see her mommy or daddy.

This is why I was in shock, because she completely understands that what she did was wrong.

When her dad found out, he was livid and decided that her punishment would be no Christmas. She will not get any toys from anyone and that he is going to donate most of her toys to charity. The little girl has literally the whole living room full of toys (thanks to her grandpa who buys her toys almost every other week). 

I feel bad that her punishment has to be that severe but she doesn't react to anything else. My boyfriend doesn't believe in spanking but he yells, scolds her, takes away play time and tv time, but nothing works. She doesn't respect him, laughs at his face, and pretends to cry to make him feel bad. 

My boyfriend has felt guilty in the past because of the divorce he went through and the split custody and all that so he did contribute to her spoiled behavior for a while. However he believes it has been long enough (2 years) for her to adjust to their new life and that this behavior and actions aren't because of that or because of me. 

What can we do with her? Everyone I talk to says it's not my responsibility as she is not my daughter and I am not married to my boyfriend, but we practically live together and I see his kids more than he does at this moment.

The kids' mother smokes, drinks, parties, and partakes in drug/drug activities. Her brother steals, is openly gay (nothing wrong with that) but has intense PDA in front of the kids, and smokes & drinks in front of the kids. The grandma spanks them and yells at them. The little girl knows about sex, how babies are born, what weed smells like, that 'God isn't real', all thanks to her mom who openly talks to her about all of this. She is encouraged to partake in adult conversation and is praised when she questions her elders.

How do we help this little girl when her innocence is taken away at her mom's house? How do we teach her that all of that is wrong when multiple people are teaching her that it is right?

We can't go for full-custody without evidence (we tried), so how do we get evidence of the negative effect the mother and her family are having on my step-child?

What do we do?!!!
Canceling Christmas is a huge mistake and something your boyfriend will end up regretting. Ground her, don't allow her to play with her favorite toys, etc., but taking away Christmas is something that is mentally scaring and something this kid will be describing to a therapist in a few years.

I get what you are saying about this girl being spoiled by her grandpa. But did you consider what you are doing, getting the son a gift and not allowing the daughter to get anything, you are doing the same thing as the grandfather? She may have enough, but that isn't the point. In trying to even things out it sounds like the son get far more positive attention from you. This is likely leading to resentment and her acting out. She want attention from you and if she can't get positive attention she will settle for negative attention.

If you do for one then you need to do for them both. It doesn't matter what other people do for them
.by singling out the son it comes across as picking a favorite whether you meant to or not. It doesn't matter what the grandpa or anyone else does. When the kids are with you they are to be treated equally. What you are doing is not equaling things out. It is causing a giant wedge in your relationship with these kids. You are picking the son as the innocent party, coddling him, pampering him because you feel he has it worse elsewhere. In doing so you have alienated this young girl. She isn't getting positive attention from anywhere. You are going to cause a world of pain and resentment if you keep on this track. If you get the little boy a toy or a treat, then you have to do the same for the little girl.

Just the way you talked about her suggests that you don't like this little girl. You view her as a problem child and you are trying to work around her. This little girl is crying our for help. Maybe focus on getting her involved in positive things, keeping her busy and happy, can help with the negative behavior. It sounds like these kids don't have any stability in their lives. It is no wonder these issues exist.

Try to figure out a way to allow both these children to feel safe and loved. Focus.on positive attention over negative attention. It is a tough situation, but until you start treat both kids the same things will always be rocky.
My son's father and I have been divorced for 4 years now. He cheated several times and when I found out about the last affair he wanted to leave. I begged him to stay and go to counseling. I didn't know then but I have since found out that he disagreed because he was seeing his current girlfriend.
The other night my son asked me to tell him why we got divorced. I had never told him a reason. Just people grow apart and the usual. He hates his dad's gf for many other reasons. He asked me if she had anything to do with it. So I told him what happened. Basic details. I didn't get into "he skipped your sporting events so he could stay home and *#!k her in your bed".
He is so mad. He says he hates his father and never wants to see him again. I was positive and told him that his dad loved him, he just made some poor choices. 
What do I do and did I do the right thing?
Although I've never experienced a partner's infidelity and have not raised a kid, I believe you did the right thing in telling him the reason(s) why you divorced from his father. 

I'm not sure if your boy has a "right" to know, but he might deserve to...and would've certainly ended up asking you at some point anyway, as he did. 

I don't think you told him too much. Give him time to mourn the loss of what he thought was a dependable adult in his life-his dad-and then he'll have the mental space to essentially re-assign Dad within the scope of his relationships with others. He may end up being mad at Dad forever, but that's his prerogative and in the end, his Dad's fault for behaving the way he did. 
Using a throwaway.

Right, i moved out of my family's house last year, i love my new place, it is really cozy, my uncle moved in as a temporary arrangement while he got back on his feet and found his own place.

That was a year ago, he is still here and no matter what i say he will not leave, he keeps saying he will apply for council housing but never actually does it, and when i pester him he just flips out.

It has gotten to a point where i cannot stand his presence, it is my house and he treats it like it is his, he is a filthy person, really fat, always burping and farting and stinking the place out, he always leaves a mess and never tidies up, my bath has a permanent dirt ring now that i just cannot remove (I have tried nearly everything). I end up having to clean his urine (and sometimes feces) off the toilet seat whenever i go after him.

Worst of all, my mum is on his side, even though it was her idea to make it a temporary thing in the first place, i want him gone, i don't want to cause a rift in my family but i just want my house back again, it is actually effecting me emotionally now.
Serve him notice.

There is no other way. He will never leave of his own accord.
I agree with /n/CynicalLibrian. He has some rights, even if not lease was drawn up. Serve him notice. I think you have to give him 30 days. I would look up tenant rights in your area. You may also try /r/legaladvice.
It sounds like it's time for the authorities to be called. 
A little background,

My mother had me at 21 with my bio father (deadbeat, left immediately) they were married but he was a horrendous and abusive man. My mum then raised me with family support til she met my step dad when i was 5.

By the time i was 9 i got a sister, i was over the moon and a year later sister number 2 was born. I love my sisters more than i can ever describe, i would do anything for them but as they have grown i realise how different of a childhood we had. I grew up in run down flats, with very few birthday or christmas', some weeks my mum didnt eat so i could and a mother who had to work 3 jobs just to survive. I will forever be in her debt for the sacrifices she made.

Now im 21 and have moved out, have a long term boyfriend and a cat. But each day i see my mum post things on facebook of "family pictures!!" or "big family fun night" or "family holiday time".. i'm never invited, im always left out.. Then she complains that i dont make enough effort to call her or visit her but i do.. i call weekly just for a chat and visit as much as my job lets me.. With such a big age gap i feel like i was the tester child, she tried things with me and now she has her perfect family and im kind of kept at arms length..



Has anybody else with a big age gap experienced this?

Sorry its soo long

*EDIT: i keep writing which instead of with.. god knows why. Changed it.*
I understand how this works from both sides.  Let me see if I can help.  

My mom had three boys a year apart from each other, raised them all by herself while busting her ass to feed them and keep them warm.  17 years later, they're all on their own and living pretty shitty lives full of drugs and jailtime, while I live a pretty charmed life by comparison (not actually, but certainly through their eyes).  They resent me for it, some more than others, and we are not close.  It hurts my mom, because she loves them and is sorry she couldn't do better for them, but they chose their paths and that's just the way it is.  

On the other hand, I was my (very young) father's first kid.  He worked hard to get a decent job and worked insane hours to give me a good life.  He and my mom split up when I was 11 even though he hadn't been happy since I was born, but he still did his best to make sure my future wouldn't be impacted by it.  He remarried when I was 20 to a woman who already had three kids (go figure), and suddenly we didn't really see each other anymore.  They went to parties and gatherings without me, and even when I was invited they'd call for a "family picture" and not tell me to be in it.  I don't think it was intentional, but it was consistent and it really hurts.  They wound up having a baby when I was 23, which made them include me a little more because he's my blood (even if only half), but we live 20 miles apart and all work, so even so it's mostly a birthdays-and-holidays relationship and it fucking sucks.  
It's hard because your life has been so different from theirs. It sounds like your mom just expects you to be around and your siblings don't know what it was like to struggle. It is hard to balance, but only you can decide how much time to spend with them.and if you want to be included. Best of luck.
No, you were not the practice child.
I didnt do the whole drugs and jailtime but i did have a really shitty time with school and went from popular to hate within a day all while dealing with my uncles suicide and my best friends death... I got really lost and fell off the rails.. i drank, i was out all night and then i left home at 16 after me and my mum just couldnt do the whole relationship thing anymore..

We're amazing now, we're in a whole new world of closeness that i love but i always wonder if she sees me differently, if she sees the damaged little girl that destroyed her family for a few years and therefore is glad my sisters are (so far) doing well.. Mind you the 12 year old just got caught drinking so..


I also dont know why im forcing you to listen to my life story haha
Haha hey, it's the Internet, what else are we supposed to do?  I understand, though.  My dad and I have a very close, special bond, but seeing him with his baby just makes me feel like such an interloper.  In my case it's because my dad is so young; he was 17 when I was born, but 40 when he had my brother, so it's weird for him to have a 24-year-old kid but not that weird for him to have a 1.5-year-old.  It's my presence that makes things awkward; without me, no one bats an eyelash.  
It makes me feel better to know there is someone in the same boat.. although, its shit for you :/ aha does that make me a bad person?

Yeah people at my mums work are shocked that she has a third daughter that is 21.. they find it crazy because she was 21.. its shit that people forget about us haha
I get it, I feel the same way!  My mom was a lot older when I was born (37) so it's never really like that with the two of us, but my dad and I have been mistaken for siblings or even a couple because we don't look that far apart in age.  In fact, when we've gone out with my baby brother without his wife, people think it's our kid together!  Blech!  
I love when people assume incest hahaha 
Always a good time lolol
My oldest daughter would have been four today. She died of trisomy 18, six das after she was born. I write a poem for her.every year and we realize a.balloon for her. We also celebrate her birthday as a family day. We will be going to the dinosaur park. I hope no one minds mw.sharing my poem. It is no great masterpiece, but sharing it is my way of sharing a piece of her with others.

For Amelia's Fourth Birthday

I wish that you were with me.
I wish I could see your face.
I wish that I could hold you close in a long loving embrace.

I long to see your smile.
Your voice I long to hear.
I long for you to tell me that you know how much I care.

I wonder what you'd look like
and how big you would have grown.
I wonder how different life would be if we could have brought you home.

I miss all of the things we had 
and all that we couldn't do.
I miss that your little sister won't have the chance to be here with you.

My heart is heavy everyday that I don't have you here.
I will never stop missing you 
and will always hold you dear.

I hope that you are someplace safe, happy and and well loved.
I hope you're with our family looking down on us from up above.

RIP little one, wishing you peace on such a hard day for you.

Thanks. I definitely can use hugs today.
Thank you :)
I'm new to reddit discovered it by accident but think you guys may be able to help me. This is a long story so I hope you can get to the end and bare with me.

When my brother was 20, he met a girl, we'll call N who was 23. She seemed nice, and well suited to my brother, the longer he was in the relationship the more he grew up where before he refused to find a job, stayed in bed all day etc N helped him get a job, and get motivated to stick at it.

After a year, my brother and N got engaged, everyone was really happy for them. This is where the happiness seems to end.

A few weeks after the engagement my brother announces that N is pregnant. He was delighted and couldn't wait to be a dad, my parents however where not happy at all. They kicked my brother out of the house and told him not to come back, so he moved in with N and her grandad, 10miles away. My brother, N and the impending baby where not mentioned in our house again until 8 months later, when my brother text me to tell me that N had safely delivered a baby girl, S.

For the first week or so my parents refused to meet their granddaughter and as I was only 15 at the time I couldnt easily get there myself. They did eventually meet her when she was about 10days old. This is when we were told that N and my brother had got married a few weeks before S was born.

We began to see them all regularly again for awhile, and my parents got used to being grandparents. Although it was obvious the relationship between them and my brother would never recover.

Just after my 16th birthday there was a knock on the door in the middle of the night. It was the police asking for my brother, it had been 18m since he moved out by this point. The police told us they wanted to speak to him in relation to an incident at his home (he, N and S had bought a house near to N's grandad a few months earlier) but they wouldn't tell us what the incident was or who was involved.

That was 2 years ago, and my brother hasn't been seen since. The police haven't found him and still won't tell us what happened the night he disappeared. All we know is N has filed for divorce (papers were served to my house, and mums been opening his mail to try and find him). We also haven't seen S since the day before the incident. My parents are too worried about upsetting N to contact her and ask to see S, she'd be nearly 3 now and we're not even sure if she knows we exist.

N's Facebook page has recently popped up in the "people you may know section" (in her maiden name mind you). I want to send her a friend request then message her asking if I can see S. I'm perfectly happy for N to be there when I see her again. But should I contact her or not? My parents never mention my brother or N but do often mention S wondering how she is etc.

If you've got this far thanks. All advise is welcomed.

Tl:Dr: My brother ran away from home after an incident at his home, his wife has filed for divorce. I've not seen my niece in almost 2 years, should I contact his wife for contact?
Yes! You are the perfect person to do this, too. You were an innocent regarding anything that took place way back when. Just make sure you are sincere to her, esp about her wellness and about your neice. Try to ask about your brother later, after you can rekindle something with her. Also, she didnt do anything wrong, and neither did you, so the both of you have that in common in this situation, let her know that. And never ever never judge her about anything so you can truly bond together, if things end up going that direction. I really hope this works out in a good way for you and your neice, you both were just kids stuck in the middle of adult crap, but now you are older, and like I said, the perfect person to try and reconnect the relationship here. Even if it's just slightly. Good luck! Keep us updated. 
1-2 years ago I read my dad's text messages and found some weird messages from a woman who claimed my mother was cheating. My dad said he wouldn't give up trust in my mother. And I never heard of this again.

 Until last Friday. I've noticed my mother is very scared when she doesn't know I am there and she is alone. She always hides the app she uses to text with him, Viber. I never have read her phone screen but I saw it was Viber. I got curious and waited for a good moment to finally see who she was texting. When she was showering and her phone was in her bag I thought it was now or never, so I got the phone out of her bag, and unlocked it (I knew her code because I looked over her shoulder) I put it in Airplane Mode and started capturing with my own phone. I saw a lot of strange texts from my mother to a guy she works with. The husband of the woman who texted my dad. There was a whole conversation with kissing smileys and things like 'I love you'. And when I scrolled back a lot, I stopped the camera and looked closely to everything said. I have written everything in a word document, having the whole conversation noted.

I usually fight a lot with my brother, but my best friend gave me the advice to tell my brother. I did tell him (he is 17 years old, I'm 14 years old). He reacted calm towards me, but when I left. He hit the door to the garage three times very hard. He later called me I shouldn't worry about it and he will fix it. But I'm afraid he will do something improvident. And I don't know what to do now.

Any advice? Thanks.

I apoligize for my long post and bad English.
I understand that this effects you, but you really shouldn't have snooped. The truth is what happens in your parents relationship should be between your parents. You went digging when you weren't equipped to handle the situation and now things are going to spiral.

It sounds like your brother is not calm. At 17, he is still a kid too. All you can do now is talk to your dad, hopefully before tour mom and brother have a huge blowout fight. You don't have to agree with what your dad decides to do, but you have to respect his wishes. It's his marriage. 

I understand why you did it, but you really got yourself in over your head. That is why it is important to stay out of other people's relationships, especially when you have been told to. What your mom is doing is wrong. It doesn't mean what you did was okay. It really wasn't. Unfortunately, all you can do is wait and see what happens.
I know I shouldn't have done it, but I was so curious and I knew she was hiding something. And I just needed to know. I still feel a little bad because of it, but I keep thinking her action was worse. Thank you very much for your opinion.
The problem is once you started digging and the information came out, there was no way to keep it hidden. I feel bad for the position you are in. Next time, don't look into things you have no business of handling.
Kind of a silly question, but an offhand remark my dad made is kind of getting under my skin. 

Background: I'm 23 and living back at home for a bit after graduation, I work full time, I clean and contribute around the house and pay all my own bills except for rent. 

My family recently decided to take the RV out for a weekend trip, which I knew and was invited to. I thought I had kind of declined/not shown much interest (admittedly I could have made this more clear initially), but I guess my family had basically assumed for me that I'd be going. When my dad mentioned that I should pack, etc. I was surprised and said I wasn't planning on going. He got a bit upset and tried to convince me to go, but I've already made plans for the weekend with friends, including helping a currently homeless friend of mine move into her new apartment. Other reasons for not wanting to go include: 1) I am incredibly introverted and spending that much time in very close proximity with *anyone* is exhausting, but particularly my family, and that exhaustion is going to carry over into the rest of my work week until I get time alone; and 2) I don't get along particularly well with my very loud, extroverted 16 year old brother (which ties into point 1). I also really hate sudden changes in plans and I wasn't expecting to go so it's tough for me to change mental gears on this. 

My dad offhandedly said something along the lines of me needing to grow up, and for whatever reason this is just really getting to me. I'm not going to try to claim that I was a perfect kid/teen or anything (I had my share of being selfish!) but one thing I did do a lot was push myself to exhaustion because of a feeling of obligation towards my parents. I feel like part of adulthood, for me, has been learning how to establish my own boundaries of what is uncomfortable or stressful for me and stick to them- and not forcing myself to do things that are damaging to myself because other people (including my parents) think I should. 

I guess I just feel like the stress I know I'm gonna build from this trip just isn't worth the family time? I live at home, I literally see my family every day, and we even still eat dinner as a family most nights. When I was in school and not seeing them as often I did go on vacations with them! But I dunno, am I being selfish here? Should I just suck it up and go to make them happy? 
It isn't immature to not go on a family outing when you already had plans. The problem is that as long as you live there they will see you as a kid and not an adult. A lot of parents have a hard time seeing their adult children as adults. It is especially hard if they are living at home because things don't seem much different to them. Hell, my husband and are have kids and his mother still sees us as children and it can be frustrating.

The truth is saying no is not unreasonable. I would sit down with your dad and talk with him about this. You need to talk to your parents about reasonable boundaries. The truth is things may not get better until you move out.
Aside from some very minor age differences and details, your situation sounds identical to the one I just left. I was put in very similar situations where a kind of implicit obligation exists to participate. I'm also introverted so I know what a pain these implicit obligations can be. While you're living with them, I suggest making the best of the time you have. Not saying you have to bend to their every whim- especially if you're helping friends instead. But make sure you're spending quality time with them, even if it initially pinches you a bit.

As far as avoiding this situation in the future, independence is your best option. Try to find a decent paying job in your field and a decent one bedroom apartment and make the move.

If you're anything like me, you feel like you're trying to work out the logistics of finding an apartment on the Moon. Seeing as you pay bills, you already have some income. Set aside as much of that as you can and don't touch it until it's needed. Then start making calls about apartments. I spent over two years living with my parents because it was easier to stay than to put the effort into moving. Don't stay in the "I'm-still-getting-on-my-feet" mode once you're out of it. Independence is more fun and you get to set the terms of family get-together.

One more thing, from personal experience. Parents can get in the habit of parenting if you live with them, regardless of your age. For about a month after I moved out my dad was still calling me with parental instructions. This passed once I moved and my family and I get along much better since that dynamic changed.

TL;DR- save up and move out, then accept or decline invitations as you see fit. It worked for me.
I am an only child of a single mom and I am considering going to college in Brooklyn (an hour and a half south of where I live now) and living with my dad--with whom my mom doesn't get along with. Is it selfish to leave my mom?

/r/college
No. You are allowed to grow up and experience life for yourself. It can be hard because your mom may have felt her world revolved around you because having a kid is all consuming at times. That is still her problem. Kids growing up and leaving the nest is healthy. It means she raised you to be a functioning adult. 

Don't let her guilt you out of doing something important to you. 
My mom is mean to me. I know it's not the end of the world. I certainly have it easy -- the woman fought for me while I was in the hospital with psychosis *thirteen times* AND one month in rehab for cocaine. Suffice it to say, it's taken a lot of twists and turns to get me to an adulthood in which I respect her and other people.

I didn't used to think about it when she was unnecessarily mean/rude with me, but my boyfriend is kind of shocked by it. His support makes me wonder, is there a way to tackle this that keeps me humanized and get her to *recognize* her position in my life?

(Example) Me: Look at these cool sunglasses I got today!

Mom: Wow. Clownish.

(Not the most acute example, but it just happened 10 minutes ago. It's not like my day was ruined [okay... it kind of was] but it just doesn't seem *decent* to me for someone to treat people this way.)

I realize that most people aren't familiar, or at least aren't up close and personal with psychotic disorders. I am well-medicated, and I am fully immersed in a social scene with peers -- good-natured, wholesome, intelligent adults (thanks, reddit!) -- and I haven't touched *any* drugs (even weed) for over 5 years. I am basically not even an ill person anymore. But I easily slip down into a pretty miserable place when she takes these opportunities to demonstrate how little she thinks of me.

(Extra info) Pretty much constant comments about my body -- in the past, on heavy psych meds, severe obesity. Now, what remains is a robust bust which she just kind of doesn't understand... It's not from her side of the family -- comments about how weird my boyfriend is, comments about how ugly my clothes are, etc.

It's not like I'm going to suffer hugely from my mom being vaguely shitty to me in a way that I guess I can basically choose to ignore, but since it's just come to my attention (my boyfriend pointed out it was unusual and deeply unpleasant) I wonder if anyone has some flawless logic to give her about how her daughter is a human being with feelings, and not just a reject that ruined her life.

My mom is 61, WASP originally from a small town in Ohio, an actress until about 10 years ago when she took an office job and shifted the acting to about 5 or 6 gigs a year, mostly in sound studios. She's a very classically beautiful woman and has been married and divorced. My stepdad is an amazing person who would *never, ever* say anything disparaging to me, nor about her. I love them both very much... But I feel like I'm not supporting her as a human being if I don't try to demonstrate that this is kind of out of line.

And... I guess, shoutout of support to everyone reading this who has a more difficult relationship with their mother than I do. If only *this* drove me to beg for help from reddit... Recognize the ways in which you're feeling shitty when you don't need to... And try to get help about it.
Congrats on staying clean, first and foremost. That's an awesome accomplishment, so be proud. When she makes one of those comments, without being attacky, express to her how the comment makes you feel. Maybe she thinks she being funny, or maybe she genuinely means them, but you don't need to endure them. She's an adult and should be able to handle the feedback just as you've been able to handle her commentary. Best of luck!
"Wow, that's rude, why would you say that?"

Blank stare. "Are we doing personal remarks now?"

Blank stare. "Hey did you see that thing on the news?"

All ways that people point out poor behaviour in non-family ways. If one of them fits in with how you'd respond to a stranger, use it with your mother. Repeat the same behaviour every time. It'll take a few repetitions but she'll get it and then you won't. Good luck.
I (22F, recent college grad) live in a small household with my brother (19M), father (75), and mother (56). My parents divorced 10 years ago, yet we all still live together in the same home. This was due to a mix of finances and health related issues. When all four of us are in the house, I share a room with my mother, my dad takes my room. When my brother returns to school in the fall, my dad will move into his room, giving me back my privacy. 

Ever since the divorce, my mother has started working full-time and she is overworked, underpaid, and very stressed out. My brother and I help around house and here and there with finances. I have a full-time job, and my brother works during his vacations. All in all, we pull our weight. 

Emotionally speaking, the stress has taken its toll. I haven't been able to connect with her since I was 12, and she is very irrational in the way she processes and regurgitates information. Everything to her is about control and money. She equates me wanting independence from her to being an "ungrateful brat who deserves nothing, after everything [she] does for me." On the off-chance she lets me go out, it's only until midnight, maybe around 1am if she likes who I'm with. Yet, on a usual basis, she doesn't even remember who any of my friends are. This is including my best friends who have been to my house fairly consistently for around 4 years now. She doesn't remember anyone unless they're of the opposite sex and have money. It's a very selfish approach, and one that I disagree with wholeheartedly.

Long story short, I feel very restricted and unsafe in a space that I'm supposed to call "home." I'm afraid to be honest to people who seem like strangers. I've grown to the point where I love them out of obligation, yet my disdain for them (mostly my mother) prevents me from connecting to them, or wanting to ever again. I don't know how  to go about attaining freedom when my mother is so restrictive and controlling of me (and my finances). 

Do any and all of you have advice/similar life experiences to mine? What did you do about them? Are you in the same stage as me? Maybe we can try to work out a solution together.
I think it's about time for you to move out.
[deleted]
You have a full time job. You are an adult. Move out and stop allowing this woman to control you. You are not an ungrateful brat. She says this to keep you under her thumb and make you doubt yourself. If you were an ungrateful child you wouldn't think twice about anything. It is your mother who is being selfish. You are old enough to go out with your friends, have some privacy and live your own life. 

When you do this, your mother is going to say all sorts of nasty things because she is going to want to keep things as they are. People don't like change, especially when it doesn't benefit them. She wants you there, partially for the money and partially for the control. She is going to make you feel like you are abandoning your family (you aren't). She will use everything from money, to your father, and anything else she can throw at you to make you stay. Don't stay.

You may need to not communicate with your mom for a while. I may not even let her know your new address right away because she may try to sabotage you. Make sure things like your cell phone and car and insurance are all in your name. That way she doesn't claim you stole anything (I don't know how bad she is, so I plan for the worst).

It is hard to see what normal is when you are living it, but this is not normal, it's abusive. You don't deserve to be treated this way and the only way it will change is if you move out. Best of luck!

I agree with the other posters in that you have no obligation to stay, and would likely be happier getting some independence by getting your own place. Hopefully, your relationship with your family would improve when you all had some space.  


However, I urge you to look at your mothers motivations for some of the things you said, particularly you staying out late with your friends.  This may seem controlling to you, but perhaps when you come home late you are disrupting her sleep. I don't know what her medical conditions are, but not getting enough sleep could have serious negative effects on her emotional and physical well-being during the day.  Her wanting you to come home early may simply be due to her frustration at the close sleeping quarters. 


Also, when you go to move out, be prepared for some pushback. If you were helping out with bills right now (rent or mortgage, food and utilities, transportation, etc.), and they are already struggling to make ends meet, then you leaving will certainly make them all have to restructure the finances. They may even see it as you deserting them and leaving them high and dry.  It may take them some time to get used to getting along without your contributions. Try not to let it get to you- you have every right to start making your own way!  I just think it will be easier to deal with this if you anticipate a negative reaction rather than be surprised by one. Stand your ground, communicate your wants and needs, but try to be kind. 


I try to live by the philosophy that everyone is just trying to do what they think is right, even if they are woefully misguided in their attempts.  I'm not sure where the following quote came from, but it might benefit you in your situation:  

"Think of the most generous explanation possible for someone's bad behavior, and choose to believe that." 
I agree
Thank you :)
This is wonderful advice. Thank you. Right now i'm underpaid at my current job and am searching for a new one. I pay my own health insurance and am putting my cell phone in my name. I currently don't have a car but when I do I'm taking care of the plates and insurance. I have a big to-do list, but a job is at the top. 
Yeah it'll definitely help my sanity
She's a very deep sleeper, and I have never implicated her sleep patterns. She just doesn't want me to get hit by a car or something from a drunk driver. I understand her concern to an extent, but I don't like to live in fear. 
I do happen to like that quote there!
I truly wish you the best of luck. It has to be very hard dealing with all these. You seem like you are strong and will get through this. If you ever need to talk, message me any time.
At least she's coming from a good place in wanting to keep you safe, rather than trying to control you.  My kids are still very little, so I can't really relate to her too much, but I imagine it must be difficult to stop "mothering" just because your kids are adults. Especially since you still live with her, she may have a hard time moving out of the role of "mom whose kids need guidance" to "mom with adult kids". 
Thank you so much!
Sorry for the long post. My younger step sister has seen the brunt of constant arguing with my dad and my stepmom. She has always acted young for her age (13), and has a tendency to act selfish. It's becoming harder and harder to watch her be constantly yelled at. I feel really bad for my sister, but I also understand my parents frustration. I have been trying to help both sides for as long as I can. Yet due to my sister repeatedly not learning from her mistakes, the arguments haven't wavered. What should I do? What should we do? At this point, any advice would be great.
Can you have a real conversation with her? Does she acknowledge or see that she's being difficult? Is there some underlying motivation for her to do so?
If you can talk to her about it, then that is a good start. I also think that whenever she is bad mouthing your parents and she is wrong about the situation, you should speak up. Let her know that you love her, but she is being unfair to everyone else in the house.
I am so far the only person that she will actually open up to. But no, she doesn't understand my parents aggravation with her.
Thank you! I will definitely make some more one on one time with her. It seems she will only actually take advice from me.
One on one time just talking sounds like the best route. Establish, strengthen a connection getting to know her and try to understand what might be going on to cause her to act the way she does. That might help you help her change the inappropriate actions.
If you consider your parents to be "bad" people, when did you realize it? For example, my dad cheated on my mom dozens of times throughout their marriage and did other shady things. I found out when I was 12 or 13 (my mom still didn't know) and after that I can't help but view my dad in a different light. 
There are definitely things about my parents that I really don't approve of. I have known it for a long time, I don't remember when I first noticed. I wouldn't say they are bad people, but they have flaws.
I've known my father was a douche since I was very young, it took me a while to figure out my mother isn't much better. 

My father was a pretty terrible person. When I was between the ages of 0 and 3 he was a mean and violent drunk and my first human memory is of him punching me in my crib. He left my mother when I was 4 and I didn't see him again until I was 11. 

My mother was a drug addict and she sent my sister and I to stay with him in another state.
My father had become a very successful businessman he is a millionaire several times over. I lived with him from the 11 - 16 and I ended up running away to stay with my grandmother on the other side of the country. He was a terrible father in more ways than I can count but I still love(d) him.

One day, when I was 17 my friends and I were hanging out at my mom's house, we were drinking and smoking and decided it would be fun to prank call my dad. I was very angry at him for being such a horrible father and we were just being stupid kids and we made the call.

I wasn't actually even the one who made the call but I was there. It was an ignorant and childish prank. My father called my mothers phone back immediately, knowing it was me, and said the last words I would ever hear him speak "Lose the number boy". That was in 1995. I haven't talked to him since.

In the time since he told me to lose the number I've traveled the world, dined with royalty, earned two degrees, got married and had 5 children, never a word never so much as an email or a text message just nothing. Over the years I've sent letters, I sent email, I tried to reconcile... nothing. Not a single word in 20 years.

I'm now a father, I have 5 wonderful children and sometimes i will look at them and wonder "What could you do that would make me not utter a single word to you for 20 years?" I can think of nothing that would ever make me disown any of my children. If one of my children literally shot me in the face, tried to murder me I still couldn't do it. I just can't understand it.

So, Reddit, my question is to you who have "Disowned" children why and do you ever think of them? Do you still love them? Do you ever regret it? I personally don't think my father ever thinks or cares about me, I mean after 20 years of not a single word I find it hard to believe he ever cared at all but I often still wonder.

If you are a parent who has disowned your child I am not here to judge I don't want anyone getting flamed or anything I just can't ask my own father, so I'm asking you.

TL;DR

My father was a horrible parent, he did everything wrong. I ran away at 15, got drunk and prank called him he hasn't spoken a single word to me since. Curious as to what is in the mind of people who disown their children.

Reading your story, I's obvious to me that it's not what you did to make him disown you. It's what kind of a parent and person he is.

I've had similar experiences with my dad, and I honestly believe we are better off having lost them.
Honestly, it wasn't you. Your father is a selfish man and he couldn't be bothered to be a father. You are better off without him. Your children are better off without him. It seems you learned all the ways you didn't want to behave when you became a father. You have your beautiful family, and while he may have money, he sounds like an arrogant, empty shell of a man. Don't be surprise if you get a call or letter or some kind of communication if he is sick/dying/ or in trouble. What you choose to do when that happens is up to you. Just know that you owe this man nothing and he has no credit for the good man you have become. 

I know that doesn't make the hurt stop. What your father did was a horrible betrayal. But you are a strong person and you don't need him.
As a child who was shunned, essentially disowned, then taken back as a successful adult, I wondered the same, and I asked.
I was told that I was thought of often, and still loved as a 'child', but I was a wreck that needed to find my own way back. (I can't blame them for that part, it was true and I was so stubborn then, but I still wish my parents had fought for me even when they didn't know how to, instead of just "letting go.") I was never bad, only once I hit my teens and realize I had my childhood robbed did I lash out uncontrollably and rock hell over high water.
That being said, I was never punched as a child, by either parent, and a little excessive alcohol enjoyment existed here and there on my Dad's side at dinner parties, but never substance abuse with either of them. And my parents still mostly tried to be parents, even after they split, at least before I went A-wall.
In your story, I don't see much similarity to mine, so your parents (Dad, especially) have no excuse - zero - for treating you with such indignity. It sounds like he's blinded by his own pride, and that will be the death of him...at which point, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried reaching you, to cleanse his spirit before his passing, if he reaches clarity before then.
You can spend a great deal of time wondering this question, but don't let it distract you from stopping the cycle of abuse with your own family. You've accomplished that already, reading this, you may just be one of those beings who didn't experience past life in the fullest, so you'll have a more flourished future paying it forward with your offspring.
If that's the case, enjoy being a 'kid' again with your own kids while you can. It's a great feeling, and you won't have any hanging questions, or regrets there.

Very cool. It's pretty cool to see international adoptees grown up because they can imagine their very different alternate reality life back in their old country. We're glad you're a part of our melting pot here in the USA!
I simply do whatever I can to avoid your wrath.  
I avoid doing things with you for fear that I may say something that offends you and that I will be publicly chastised or privately terrorized.  
I hold my tongue when I am with you and you say racist or angry things or things that I otherwise disagree with.
I avoid you when you come home from work or really any time I can because I can’t bear to experience your family being the eternal recipients of your constant anger.  
I withhold my hurt when you angrily criticize everyone around you for being disagreeing with your personal or political opinions.  

I have learned to not express my desire to learn about anything you haven’t told me to.
I have learned to avoid you.

I don’t want you to accept my opinion or even to respect it.  I just want you to not be angry at me for it.  

You're not abusive, just angry.  I love you, and I know you have come a long way.  I wish sincerely for your happiness. 

But I find it very hard to have my own happiness while living surrounded by your anger.  

Please don’t yell at me for this.  
I am sorry for what you are going through. I have a father who can get angry at the drop of a hat. When he is angry and miserable it is awful. 
>You're not abusive, just angry.

There's more to abuse than beating people.

I'm sorry that this is something you have to deal with (for a few years more), but I don't think you should discount it as "not abuse".
I used to have the exact same issue with my father. You seem like a compassionate kid and I think you want to be able to please your father and being unable to do so gives you pain. That was my problem until I learned that some people simply are incapable of being pleased; sometimes parents included. Learn to focus on pleasing yourself. Try to please people only if they reciprocate your respect with kindness, otherwise it is not worth getting upset over. I dealt with depression as a teen over this and it simply isn't worth it. You are developing into an adult and your life; school, sports, work, socializing, whatever you do is more important than trying to please a constant grouch. I know it sounds corny, but try to please yourself through hard work and kindness. It's healthier for you and will help you mature into adulthood.
Hi. I have had no contact with my abusive family for 3 years despite living in their flat (yep, that's how it is). They have always pressured me to study and get a better job, said “all you do is for ourselves and your only purpose in life is to support us when we get old" (I'm not kidding). When I argued with them about that they shamed me, said I’m ungrateful, disgusting, I’m no son of theirs etc.

I want to know, do normal parents expect their children to provide for them when they are old? Is it socially expected of a person to support them? Is it looked upon if I cut all connections with them? Because otherwise I feel like they treat me like a sacrificial animal and some long-time investment.
You don't have to support them when they are old. If you wanted to, felt a moral obligation, that is one thing. If you want to cut ties with them that is your business and no one else's. People should be prepared for their retirement. They should be planning and saving. It is not on you to have to completely take care of them if they refuse to take care of themselves. 

I wouldn't expect my kids to take care of me. My husband and I have planned for our retirement. We have been saving and investing because we don't want anyone to have to take care of us when we are older. I want my kids to be able to live their lives, start their own families if that is what they want. They shouldn't be prevented from doing these things because they need to take care of us.
The answer to whether it's expected can depend on your country and culture.  I know some cultures which expect their elders to move into their house with them eventually.  

Personally, I don't expect my kids to take care of me - but A) I hope to be able to care for myself until the end! and B) I hope (not expect/demand) that if I do need special care, they will be willing to care or find proper care for me.  We are establishing our own retirement savings, so hopefully they wouldn't need to care for me financially.

I will care for mine if they really become dependent, even if that means helping find an appropriate senior care home for them.  But they've never asked (or told) me to.
I think parents hope you're there for them when they age but my goodness, your parents actually expecting to be cared for is a terrible reason for having kids if that's why they did so in the first place!

Nobody can determine what happens in future, if you died before them then that was pointless wasn't it... Having this goal of being cared for when you're old by your slave, in debt children. 

Pretty much I'm trying to convey it is extremely disrespectful of them to have this expectation and then guilt you or call you names for not living up to it. Screw any expectations and conditioning, from your parents or society, do EXACTLY AS YOU PLEASE. Study what you like, live, travel, love where and who you like. It is your life and nobody else's unless you want them in it. 

In western society as far as I understand, it's not expected to care for them. They're usually placed in old people's homes for carers to cater to them so their kids don't have to deal with their crap (probably literally when they get geriatric). 

It may be looked upon for some cultures or people if you cut connections, but as someone stated, that is your business! If your parents are detrimental and restrictive to your health, do not hesitate to get out of there! Cutting connections is for you, and your wellbeing. Best wishes with it! Don't take anybody's crap, not even your parents. Nobody else is in your shoes, and no matter how much you explain, justify, describe your actions or theirs, only you have the right to assess your life.

And by the way, you don't owe your parents anything. They've probably pulled this card on you so many times, but you didn't ask to be born. 
I could relate to your answer a lot. Thank you. I've often caught myself having these thoughts exactly.
Don't let yourself feel bad about a thing! There are some crazy parents that'll pull a lot of sh*t on you for their own benefit - my parents are the type that guilt me too about my own safety.
 You're welcome though, if you need any other help just PM. 
Hello. Let me jump right into this I'm a loving father, my daughter just turned 3 December 5th I'm going through a rough custody case and doing it all (pro per) and my child mother is making it extremely hard. She just filed a restraining order over a picture I drew 12yrs. Ago.before I even knew her. I have a rocky past, which she's using against me with everything she's got.I've never committed domestic violence, but have violence on my record (bar fights) I'm 2 1/2yrs sober I attend classes to better myself and am devoted to staying sober. I love my daughter with all my heart. I'll do whatever it takes to keep her in my life. If there's any family law lawyer out there reading this and can help me I'll forever be in your debt. I live in Roseville, CA . I really need your help
Hey - /r/legaladvice might have more advice for you, but the best plan would probably be to consult a lawyer.
You also may want to ask in /r/parenting.
Thank you!
Advice needed! My 15 year old nephew snooped and found his gift for christmas (he was intentionally looking for it.) it was in a sealed box, he opened it and found out what it is. He has been bragging about knowing what it is, not in an excited way, just an obnoxious way. 

My instinct is to send it back, and maybe give him a card or something saying how excited I was to give him this gift and how disappointed I am that he ruined that for me and thus the gift is being sent back, and because of the shipping costs I am unable to buy him replacement gift. Is this to harsh? His attitude towards the whole family hasn't been great lately either, which is typical for his age. 
I think it is perfectly reasonable not to give it to him. I don't think you need to give him any explanation beyond he ruined it and was being an ass so you sent it back. 
I would absolutely do that, and if my kids had behaved that way I would support anyone who chose to do that to them. 

Edit: although instead of returning it I would donate it. 
I can tell you as a parent that if any of my brothers or sisters did this without talking to me, they'd be getting a pretty cold shoulder for a while.

Parenting is parenting; uncle-ing is uncle-ing. You don't "Teach my kid a lesson" like this without bringing me into the loop.
Do you use this same logic on everyone else in his life? Grandparents? Teachers? Employers? Police officers?
In order, yes, no, no, no. 

Employers, teachers and the police aren't parenting. 

I didn't say I wouldn't agree, mind you. I said I'd better be in the loop. 
>Employers, teachers and the police aren't parenting. 

But they do teach us some of our most important lessons.
Growing up in my family I was given a speak when spoken too rule while my siblings were not. I have noticed a marked difference in our ability to socialize (they can ,I can't) so I was wondering if anyone else had this rule in their families growing up and how it's affected them.
I have always felt that rules like this and the ideology that "children should be seen and not heard" are bordering on offensive in that it treats children as subhuman instead of as developing people. "Respect your elders" can verge on this too if it's taken to an extreme (although I have no problem with "respect other people"). It's good to acknowledge that people older than you may have more life experience, but I don't think people should be broken into a class hierarchy based strictly on age.

Of course it makes sense to teach your kids that there are appropriate and inappropriate times to speak up and voice one's opinion/thoughts, and that sometimes it's important to wait your turn to talk, or that it's disrespectful to talk at certain times (if someone else is talking, if people are having a moment of silence, if it's a quiet area or activity). But I don't think it's healthy or good for development to tell someone that they must remain silent at *all* times unless they are called upon to speak, just because they aren't an adult.

I'm sorry I can't share personal experience with this rule because I didn't grow up with it, but I figured maybe you'd be open to hearing opinions on it as well.
So I'm 20 years old and like the title says my dad is an ortho surgeon. A little history is important here so let me explain.

Throughout my childhood I have loved sports. Every sport I played required you to get a physical and have all the paperwork filled out by a medical professional. Dad always made this extremely easy because he could fill out my paperwork, and any of my friends that didn't have time to go to their physician would go to him too. This being said I have never had a full physical exam performed until a few weeks ago. Here's where it gets interesting.

Schedule an appointment with my new primary care physician for an outer ear infection. I go in knowing I need an oral antibiotic and the stronger drops (suspension I think?). Well I walk back to the exam room and the wonderful nurse with black teeth starts asking me questions and putting info on the little laptop/tablet. The dude walks in and starts asking me all sorts of questions about my ear and then he starts talking with me and brings up that he knows my dad. Then he asks "So did your dad fill out your physical forms when you played sports too?" I said yes and he said "Well I guess we need to do an actual physical on you and I my next patient cancelled so if you want we can do it right now." I agreed thinking I should be in perfect health other than the obvious extra padding that accumulated over the last two years. Well to cut to the chase here when we got to the part where he starts feeling my spine he asked me if I had ever had back pain or if I was ever diagnosed with scoliosis when I was younger. I didn't think much about it until he said I'd like to reschedule you to get a few X-rays of your back just to ease my concern because I think you might have a slight curvature in your back that could be scoliosis but I'm not jumping to conclusions right now. Fast forward a week.

Go in to get X-rays and the entire time the X-ray lady is asking me over and over if I'm sure I haven't been diagnosed with scoliosis. At this point I'm getting pissed because she's asked it at least 20 times in the last three minutes. Doc looks at the X-rays and says to me "Well it looks like you have scoliosis but I'm going to send these to a specialist to get the specifics that you should know. Fast forward to yesterday.

Get a phone call and doc confirms I have a 14 degree curvature in my lower back and my L4 and L5 have shifted because of this. The doc then said that had I had an actual physical performed when I was younger that it could have been caught and I could have been put in a brace to correct it. This recent diagnosis is extremely concerning for me because I know that there have to be more parents that also have their MD that are probably doing the same thing and their kids might pay the price later in life.

PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS GOOD IN THE WORLD TAKE YOUR CHILD TO GET A PHYSICAL WITH A DIFFERENT DOCTOR THAN YOURSELF OR YOUR SPOUSE! DO IT FOR THE CHILDREN!
> Dad always made this extremely easy because he could fill out my paperwork, and any of my friends that didn't have time to go to their physician would go to him too.

Wow. It doesn't sound like the problem was that your doctor was your dad, it sounds like the problem was your dad wasn't being a doctor.

It is certainly irresponsible, unethical, and illegal for your father to be signing off "ok" for physicals he didn't actually perform.
I'm sorry this is happening to you. Excuse my language, but it's very shitty that you dad has put you in this situation. Doctors are not supposed to treat family for reasons like this. If you are too close to the patient you may not make the best decisions because you are considering things you shouldn't or are being protective or anything in between. You should have at least had yearly physicals with a primary care doctor. I'm really surprised no one brought this up as a problem because the sports team should not have accepted this (unless you are in a small town and there was no alternative readily available). 

Have you talked to your dad about this? I would be asking a lot of questions. He either missed it, which would be a problem since it was so noticeable to the other doctor right away. Or he knew and ignored it. Both are a huge problem. I don't know the specifics, but it seems like malpractice. I know he's your dad, but you might want to consider reporting him to the state medical board. It would cause a lot of family drama, but what he did was wrong. If he really, truly missed it then he could do that to another patient. I can understand if you don't want to do this, but it is something to consider.
Interesting. I grew up in Norway, and you never needed a physical to sign up for any team sport (not as many lawsuits?), but there were regular check-ups at the community health centre, etc. However, I never went in for a physical as an adult, until quite late in my student days, and did indeed discover something that needed treatment - even for adults, it's good to do a physical once in a while.

There are some research articles about physician's wives (back when most doctors were men) having poorer health than the average population, often because their husbands would think they could deal with anything, and would not send them to see specialists etc.
I didn't even think about that. I mean he asked them all the questions on the forms and their parents were there to make sure but I never even thought about the legalities of it. Thanks for responding!
I'm an undergraduate considering having children. I am eventually going to get my masters degree so 4+ years of school ahead of me. don't want to wait to have kids until I'm done with college in my early 30's for personal reasons but I may have to. Just looking for input or advice about going through school pregnant or with young kids. Thanks in advance!
I went to college at 22 as a single-parent when my daughter was almost 1. I graduated with two majors in three years with a 3.9 GPA. I had some financial support from my parents, and I also worked part-time on campus. My school gave me need-based scholarships so while I still have about $10k of debt, it would have been much more (annual tuition as my school was about $45k).

Its totally doable, if you are a diligent student. Classes don't take up that much of your time, so your kids would only be in child-care for a few hours a day. Professors are often accommodating (I had to bring my baby to class once or twice). It can be lonely though and you miss out on all the normal college stuff, but I was already sober and wasn't going to be partying a bunch anyway, so that didn't feel like a big price to pay, for me.

My daughter is now in first grade and I'm planning to go back to graduate school next year, hopefully, and during that time I would like to re-marry and have another baby. I think the hours are more manageable and because you can do your work anytime of the day, and from home, its a lot easier to accommodate school and parenting.
I graduated college,got married, had kids... y'know, did everything in the "right" order... Then my husband died and I found myself raising a young child without any real marketable skills. So now I'm back in school, taking online classes offered by a local university. I do my classwork while my son is also in school (he just started first grade) and work evenings. I was able to get a grant and some financial aid for school so the only real blow to my income has been scaling back and changing my work hours. The hardest part is working nights and being away from my son. Luckily we have extended family that care for him while I work, but I miss being home with him. I just keep reminding myself that I am doing this for him and our future... most days, that's enough to get me through the rough bits.
What did you do for childcare? Were your bills and cost of living high?
I was fortunate in that I was living in a condo that my parents owned, so I had relatively low living costs. I paid for private daycare during the day, at first only half the day but eventually the full day (9-5) so that I could both go to class and work. I did all of my school work between classes. I used my church daycare and would work through services in the church library, too, that helped a lot on the weekends. It was exhausting because I was nursing and my daughter didn't sleep through the night until she was 2 so I was always sleep deprived. But it was worth it, I loved being in school. 
I'm 13 years old. Here are my questions: 1.How to approach/ask your father for one. (I don't live with my mom) 2.Is it normal? 3. I would like the subscription but would it be better if I got 1 mag? 4. What would you say to your son if he asked you? Thanks!
P.S. I have not had the talk with my dad, don't think I ever will either.
First, distributing pornography to a child is illegal. Second real women are nothing like those dolled up fantasies and gives you a warped sense of reality which is sure to disappoint you later in life. Third, use the lingerie section in the JC Penneys mag like every other normal boy. Just remembered those women are airbrushed and edited so that they don't even look like the original model anyway.
just use free porn sites bro
No. 
Guys, please help me, my mother abuses me every day and tells me that i should go to hell and burn there. she swears at me, i don't know what to do, i know computers well and sometimes i reinstall her windows on computer but if it lags just a little bit she blames me,if wifi is gonna turn off she blames me, tv is gonna get crashed she blames me, world war 3 is gonna start, she blames me. i'm still a kid and it really hurts my feelings so please help me and give me some tips on how to deal with her.
How old are you?
Unfortunately,  you can't make people change. It is horrible to live with someone like that, but all you can do is change how you react. It's hard, but do your best to ignore her. She is being rude and unfair and demanding. Do what you feel comfortable with and nothing more. I would also talk to a counselor. It's hard because it's the summer,  but talking to your school's counselor may help. So people are bitter and cruel. They are emotional vampires, living off of making other people miserable. Once you realize that you are being reasonable,  she is not and that it isn't worth the time energy to worry about it the better off you will be. You deserve to be happy. Ignore her as much as possible and do your best to save up so you can move out when the time comes.

Here are some thoughts for you.

* Your mother is *very wrong* to talk to you like that about going to hell, and so on. Keep that in mind. She is no religious authority I'd bet, and even if she were, I'll bet others of your religion would be horrified she'd say this to a kid and think she was okay or right to do so.

* Do not accept what people say about you as the truth (good OR bad) without some reality testing. People say things to you for their own reasons, such as manipulation, hurting your feelings or buttering you up.

* Are all these incidents when she is mad about IT malfunction or does she generally get mad and swear?

* I eventually stopped doing my parents' IT stuff. Things like this are the reason why. With your mom's temper it may be better to find a way to do  other things to do when she's mad about a brand new problem, until she cools off; and then fix it later when she is less likely to yell.

* Generally speaking, if you live with someone who makes life unpleasant and you can't get out right now, you need to have a plan. Talk to one or more people at school, like a counselor or a favourite teacher. Have a plan when she is being angry at you; can you make yourself scarce at the library, a friend or relative's house or some other safe place where you are welcome to visit? 

* KEEP ON doing what's good for you, please. Sleep, do your homework, get your exercise, take care of your hygiene, and try really hard to better yourself. That's how you escape living with unpleasantness, and it's how you rise above to a better life later, that doesn't make *you* into a similarly unpleasant person as an adult.

* If your mother is emotionally abusive, you all need help. 
[The U.S. Department of Justice defines emotionally abusive traits as including causing fear by: intimidation, threatening physical harm to self, partner, children, or partner's family or friends, destruction of pets and property, forcing isolation from family, friends, or school or work.[8] Subtler emotionally abusive tactics include insults, putdowns, arbitrary and unpredictable inconsistency, and gaslighting (the denial that previous abusive incidents occurred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse)

* If your mother hits you, you need help.

She generally gets mad, i am trying to make her laugh but she jut says GTFO, she hits me but i can take it. i am planning on moving to my best friend's house when i will be 18, (i'm 13 now)
My 10 year old said, "Open up, Mom!" and got ready to throw me a Cheeto. I said, "No, don't tempt me with that. I don't eat those anymore." My 8 year old said, "I don't mean to be rude," (always a good start to any comment!) "but you USED to eat those...when you were fat." Now I have lost 27 lbs (Yay Me!!), but at 238 I am certainly far from skinny. I just laughed and said, "I am going to take that as a compliment. I think there was one in there somewhere!" LOL  

Lol. Kids can be so candid, but a least you know they mean it. Congrats on the weight loss :)
My little sister has basically been on a self destructive path for a few years now.  She's one of those people that no matter where she goes trouble follows.  She's burned bridges with pretty much every single member of our family...she's stolen from everyone from our 12 year old sister to our 65 year old grandpa.  She's also been arrested for drug related issues and definitely has a problem with substance abuse.  She can be very cruel and has said many hurtful comments to just about everyone in our family. Every once in awhile she will reach out to me and tell me she misses me...but it's one of those scenarios where you find yourself playing with fire.  Every time I let her get close to me I end up getting burned. I had resolved to cut off all ties with her but every once in awhile I feel that I'm missing what should be an important relationship in my life. My family members seem to always try to make amends with her which leaves me looking like the bad guy. Do you think we are obligated to keep trying to make family relationships work?  I hate to see my sibling hurt but I don't want to risk my own happiness trying to salvage someone else's. 

I am sorry for your troubles. You are not wrong to cut ties with your sister. She has some serious issues that itn sounds like she needs to work through. Sometimes people have tonhit rock bottom before they are willing to get real help. At the moment it seems she only reached out to you in an attempt to use you. You love her, but that doesn't mean you have to let her take advantage of you. Stay strong and maybe one day she will genuinely want to fix things.
Family drama is rough.  Take a step back to determine your next.  "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me."  There's a fine line between seeing a glimmer of change and 1. becoming a supportive aid or 2. an enabler.  If she's only reaching out to use you and feed her poor habits, you will only allow her to take advantage of you to continue those poor habits.  Sometimes the best way to help someone is the hardest way--to let them fall.  Otherwise, they will never learn to pick their own selves up.
Thank you for the solid advice.  I think I knew this was the answer but just needed to hear it from a non-biased perspective.  I sincerely wish the best for her and hope she does get her life together.
When my older sister found out she was pregnant she was looking for daycare and no one would take her son until he was either 18 or 24 months. She also needed the day care to take him at 7am and most places near her don't open till 7:30am or 8am.

So me, 19 at the time having nothing really going for me, offered to be a live-in nanny until he was old enough for day cares to take him. I thought when I first told her that I would do it we had agreed upon $100/week (I'm here to help out my sister not make a fortune off of her). When I had moved in my phone bill had needed to be paid so she paid $300 onto it. Then my birthday comes around and she gives me $100 and says part of it is a birthday present and part of it is pay. Then the hydro went off in her house (people working on the power box outside her place) so she sends me $25 so I can take her son out and go get food (couldn't cook without hydro) but as we are getting ready to leave the hydro came back on so she told me to keep the $25 as pay and stay home. And now recently my phone bill got back up to $350(2 months unpaid) so she paid it and thats all the money I have seen from her. I have been working for 11 weeks now (5 days a week) and I have only seen about $700 from her plus room and board. Her husband (who i'm starting to dislike) keeps saying I don't need any more money because they are providing a roof over my head and food (her cooking is AMAZING) in my stomach. And he says it in such a way where I end up feeling extremely guilty for asking for more money.

Any advice would be nice. I also don't want to have to cut ties with my sister (we are a close family) and she tends to hold grudges.
Talk to your sister and explain that when you agreed to be a live-in nanny, you and her both agreed on $100/week.  You both committed to it and she needs to live up to her end of the bargain.  The room and board is a given as a live-in nanny and is irrelevant.  It should have no bearing upon your agreed upon $100/week.  Don't even bother talking to your brother-in-law, you and your sister agreed upon the terms, so talk to her.

Also, on a side topic, what the hell kind of phone plan do you have where you mass up $350 in just two months?  I have straight-talk through Walmart which can be based on Verizon or AT&T phones/towers and I only pay $45/month for unlimited call, text, and internet.  The internet isn't that fast, but I'm almost always near wifi anyways so it doesn't matter.  If you're getting $175/month in cell phone bills, you should seriously reconsider your plan.  Especially since you seem to keep getting behind on payments.
I know you don't want to damage your relationship with your sister, but if she isn't holding up her end up then this is never going to work. I would make arrangements to move out and tell her either she pays you on a regular schedule or she has x amount of time to find someone else. She may be upset, but you can't keep working for free.
I'm on Rogers, $60/month per phone (I have 2) but I had gotten stuck with extra fees for something. I think it was to turn my phone back on after it got so high that they suspended it. (before I moved in) I am on a contract for another year, but as soon as I can I am getting away from Rogers. There is a phone company in Canada called Koodo that is awesome that I want to go to.

Edit: I had cross-posted this into nannies and its not even like I am asking for an absurd amount of money a week. They had actually said I was asking for next to nothing. I'm not here to make a fortune off of my sister but I would like to have some money saved up when I leave here.
I have arrangements to move out already and she knows this. My sister had said once she gets her raise I will start to get paid. I am giving her the benefit of the doubt and waiting till then. Her raise start sometime in July. If I am still not getting paid after her raise I am going to tell her I refuse to work for pretty much nothing and give her my notice. I'm not working for 100% free, I'm working pretty much just to pay my phone bill.
Yeah, I agree with /r/Nannies you deserve your $100/wk for sure!  Definitely talk to your sister.

And it sounds like Rogers is screwing you.  Why do you have two separate phones?
I am going to talk to her as soon as she gets her raise. Which should be sometime in July.

I had 2 phone because my ex had one and I had the other but then we broke up and I was stuck with both. My mom is now using and paying for my second phone. 

$100 /week is very reasonable in my mind. I was looking at other nanny/babysitting jobs and other people are offering $300/week for not as many hours

I would really like to see the results. Very interesting survey.
A group of psychologists at the University of British Columbia found that when a father performs a greater share of traditionally female household chores such as cooking, cleaning and childcare, his school-aged daughter is less likely to say she wants to pursue a stereotypical female career such as nursing, teaching or staying at home with the kids, and more likely to aspire to more gender-neutral (and often higher-paying) careers, such as becoming a doctor or lawyer.
you know, a link would be nice

Nice try, wife. 
Despite every trouble at home I love how my parents laugh together, play music and enjoy having each other. It's the most beautiful feeling to see your parents happy.
It's a good reminder that things don't have to be perfect to be good :)
Aww. 
Because she has trouble hearing/paying attention over the phone. 

But I just called my mum for Mothers Day, and I wasn't stressed once, but I cried. It's pretty common for me to cry but not from just talking to my mom... she's been sick for a while, something is always wrong with her health these few years, her voice was very hoarse, and she told me she falls down often and it's getting harder for her to get up each time, and she always fears losing her job which I understand. To be honest things haven't been to great for me lately, I've been unemployed since November with no means of a steady income. But despite everything that going on with her she's still being a wonderful mom and offering me to move with her and my step-dad in Oklahoma. (I live in California.) This is my first time talking to her in a long time, I know I'm a shitty person. Her offering me to move is really sudden and I don't know if I could, aside from the factor of not knowing anyone there and not really being social etc. etc... To be honest the biggest reason I don't want to do it is because my mom and step-dad are pretty closed minded, very religious, and very political. I'm okay with people being religious and being political, do whatever makes you happy, but I do get tired/stressed from hearing about it all day and it usually involves nothing but depressing topics... But I don't know, I might have no choice but to move to Oklahoma in June...

Thank you for reading if you did.

TL;DR... My mom might be really sick, and wants me to move with her, but I'm too conflicted. 
I am sorry for your troubles. It isn't an easy situation.  Only you know what it right for you. I think ot would important to know what they would expect of you if you moved in. Would you be paying rent? Would you be expected to take care of your mom? I would also recommend seeing what kinds of jobs are available in the area. You may end up stuck woth your mother with no means to move. If you have to do it it could be stressful. Only you know what you can handle. I wish I had some helpful advice. All I can do is wish you luck and offer to listen if you ever need a sounding board.
Just you saying that helps a lot, thank you very much :)
Hey everybody,

So I'm 28 and have a job out in Washington D.C., but I live in Virginia. I have a 20 year old cousin who comes over to my house at all hours of the day (he has a key...not sure why I made that judgment call) eats my food, plays video games for hours and just is a nuisance overall, especially since he stays super late (I work long hours in government and he is "taking a semester off" from American University) and keeps me up.

How do I tell him, politely and without causing a huge rift: "fuck off and go somewhere else?" He's over here all the time and I can't really entertain or bring people over since he's just here...on the couch...taking up space and my food. 

Thanks!
Hey, cousin, I gave you a key to my house so you could get in and I don't mind that you come over, but you're abusing the privilege. I work long hours and you stay late, and I feel like I can't just bring people over because you're always here. So I think we need to set some ground rules: you can't stay past 10pm, and you can't be here every day. Pick two/three/four so I can have a social life in my house. Oh, hey, and while we're talking, stop eating all my food. 
First you have to accept that he os going to take offense no matter how nicely you talk to him. He is also likely to turn things around on you to make it seem like the problem is with tou. I'm sure he already knows he is mooching. 

Tell him that while you don't mind him coming over sometimes he is over too much. Tell him you don't mind a visitor,  but you don't want a roommate. Tell him you would like to be able to a use your own apartment and you can't anymore.  Maybe start by limiting how many days a week he can cone over and how Lon he can stay. You work and you need your sleep. Maybe say he can come over two or three days a week, he has to check with you on what days first and he has to leave by a certain time. Also, he needs to bring his own food/drink. Again, he is not your roommate.  

If it becomes a problem and he abuses the privilege then you need to change t he locks. It is extreme, but it may be the only way to keep him out. It is not unreasonable to want and need your own space. He is taking advantage of you and will do so as long as he can. He is going to fight against thongs changing because things are how he wants them right now. Put your foot down and stay strong. If the rest od your family has a problem with this then they are not looking out for you. Best of luck :)
Awesome, thanks! 
That's excellent. Thank you! 
No problem. It isn't easy, but you deserve to enjoy your own apartment.  Best of luck :)
I'm stuck.

My mother confides in me a secret. After 28 years of marriage, she found out that my father has been cheating on her. She also described her lack of a sexual relationship with my father, because he has sex with men. As their son, I have been the sensitive child who has tried to mediate the conflicts between my parents. I always tried to help them calm down after their childish arguments directly in front of me. It is not my responsibility, but I am a kid who craves the conventional nuclear family... And I feel like I have been the parent of the household, resulting in a lack of a parental figure in my life.

Let me also note that this has resulted in my mental state. I am constantly depressed, anxious, dissociated from my independent life, and very sensitive to emotional affect in others. I am constantly fearing abandonment by people who I am in close relationships with. This is symptomatic of my Borderline Personality Disorder.

So... as I said, I am stuck. I'm failing out of college, yet again, unable to focus on myself. My father... god I hate him. He is arrogant. He uses my mother so that he can live an easy life in a conventional family. I have sympathy for his sexual orientation and the challenges he must have faced in his early adolescence, however the fact that he reaps benefits from my family, and forms a vacuous parental attitude (I feel like I've never had a father). Ambiguous-ambivalent parent who doesn't care how I turn out in life yet still dictates the trajectory in my life to maintain his traditional view of family. Fuck him.

I don't know whether I should confront my family members. I see it happening down the line. But I can't stand the fact that I am here right now.

Thanks, for reading.
I am vcompletely sorry for what you are going through. My mother also confides in me and puts me in uncomfortable situations,  so I understand how hard it can be. It is completely unfair to place this burden on your shoulders. 

Therapy helped me a lot. I learned that it would never stop unless I made it stop. I told people when I wouldn't talk about things and if they persisted I hung up the phone or walked away. It is hard and I still am not perfect with it. It caused friction. People rebel against change and will beg, yell, cry, and barter to get you to cave. I didn't speak to my mother for a couple of months,  but it did get better. 

As for your father, only you know if confronting him is worth it. He may be apathetic and it may only lead to frustration.  That said, you do not have to put up with him. Limit your contact with him if you can and speak up when he does something tjat upsets you. You can't change him, but you can change how to interact and react to him. What he is doing is wrong and both you and your mon deserve better. Unfortunately,  it seems like she isn't going to leave him. You can't make her. 

Whatever you do, it is important to realize their problems are  on them. What your father does to upset your mother is his fault. It can be hard, but it can make your life better. I used to be anxious and depressed and I constantly felt nervous and worried. I was a mess. Now, while I care about them, what they do is on them and their drama will not drag me down. It took my mother taking advantage of me at my lowest to seek help. She and my grandma planned a second funeral for my daughter (she died six days after birth from a genetic disorder we found out she had only hours before she died). We thought it was a memorial where they just mentioned her in prayers and that we would spend time with family after. It almost killed me walking into that and being completely blind sighted (my husband too, who is an atheist and didn't protest the religious aspect because he knew it meant something to me). Don't wait until they destroy your life. You deserve better and they won't let you have it unless you put your foot down.  It is much harder if you live with them. 

I'm a little scattered brained tonight,  so I apologise if I am all over the place. Best of luck. If you ever need to talk, message me anytime. Even if it is just or you need some moral support. Change is hard, but you can do it and you are worth it.
My ill mother recently produced letters and told me the story of my great grandfather, whom I never met.  He died of emphysema in 1965, at ~54.  My mom didn't know much about him other than he served as a squadron leader of some sort during the blitzkrieg of Poland.  

After the battle, he was so distraught by the sight of war and what the officers were ordering the men to do.  So, therefore, he went AWOL at his first chance and got a ride to France.  He spoke fluent French and just posed as a French laborer.  

He married my great grandmother, a Jewish Pole, and pretended her two children were his own.  They fled to Canada and later the US, and posed as married French/Polish couple for 25 years, till he died.  

The ONLY reason they got married was to survive the war.  

My Great Grandfather spent the next 20 years of his sham marriage smoking, drinking, and doing odd jobs for money.  He almost never left his room and listened to old Polish music when he wasn't mowing lawns or fixing ice boxes.   

So, I ask, should I feel any guilt because of my Nazi heritage?  


I'm confused. Why would you have guilt because of what a family member was or was not a part of? So no is my answer!
No, you shouldn't. No one is responsible for their ancestor's errors.
One of my (Jewish) friends likes to say "Yeah, my grandfather got sent to a concentration camp."  Pauses.  "He was a guard." It happens to be true.  He doesn't feel guilt about it and being a guard seems miles worse than being a soldier - which is what most people his age would have been at that time - especially considering he went AWOL.

Nope! 
Wait, is he even a blood relative since the kids weren't his? Crazy interesting story, but you don't have to feel guilty about it either way. Well, maybe can't be helped since you're Jewish too. ;)

Yes. 
He is a blood relative to me and my mom, but not at of my cousins. 
I am a 14 year old boy with amblyopia and former anxiety issues (I have been to a counselor). My mother shouts at me and is very vehement towards me at times, while my dad just is very strict. My brother (College age) always sides with my parents and threatens me with violence if I don't do what my parents say. 

Two documented occasions:

1. When I was 12 years old, me and my brother were having an argument outside. We were both shouting loudly, but I was making a lot more noise. My mom threw open the door and commanded me to get inside. I walked inside, confused, and she immediately slapped me and threw me to the floor, before sending me to my room.

2. This incident was partly my fault, in the months leading up to it I had been very angry towards my father and sometimes my mother because of his behavior towards my mom and me. My parents have teetered on the edge of divorce, and have regular arguments. My father likes to make derogatory statements, calling things "gay" and making fun of other cultures. Often times he is very irresponsible, leaving the house for hours at a time to go to a bar (he is not an alcoholic) and meet up with his friends (many of which are female, and he gets very close to them). I am very put out by his behavior, especially recently now that I have a far different, non-conservative point of view than my parents. Consequently I became very flippant with my parents, and oftentimes rude. I am working on my own behavior, as I realize it is wrong.

Enough back story, here's what happened:
While me and my family were having lunch, my father knocked over my root beer and it spilled on me and the table. We cleaned it up quickly and proceed to eat. I was joking with my brother when my dad asked me if I wanted another taco shell. I said no thanks but I didn't look at him. My father then began lecturing me about politely responding to people. At the end, I agreed with him and apologized.
Very soon later, my brother asked my mom a question and she responded yes without looking at him. I asked my dad about this, as it was the kind of behavior I was just scolded for, so I was confused. After starting to explain why it was different, ( I didn't catch the end of it) my mother suddenly slapped me and grabbed me by the hair (I have long hair), before throwing me to the ground. She started shouting things like "piece of shit!" "Don't belong in this family" "leave us alone" and then she pointed I the back room of the RV we were traveling in and told me to "get out of my sight and don't make a fucking noise."

I cried softly for about two minutes while I listened to my mother toss what was left of my root beer in the sink, and slam pots and pans around while calling me a "bastard" and "little shit".

She later apologized to me after we talked about my behavior, but only for slapping me.
I am not sure what to do in this situation, and if it is abuse then I want to find an alternative to calling the police because I do not want to go to child services.
Do you have a school counselor or someone you can talk to about this?
Yes. This is abuse. You should talk we a teacher you trust and/or a school counsellor.  Be away they probably won't remove you. Let them know if you don't feel safe. They may be able to get you into therapy, which can be helpful.  Your parents seem to enjoy having such control over you. This isn't being strict. They are constantly keeping tou off balance emotionally. 

Best of luck. You aren't alone and you don't deserve to be treated like this. If you need to talk,  PM me any time.
Abusive people do not enjoy being abusive.  They are immature people who later genuinely feel bad about their actions but are too weak to change patterns they create.  But there is more than abuse going on here...
My first thought is are you adopted?  I don't expect that answer to be yes.  Your parents are considering divorce; likely one feels trapped the other scared and they are lashing out stupidly.  I'm almost 40 and I'll tell you there are plenty of folks my age who haven't changed since they were 14.  I doubt they are intentionally harming you, but they are certainly being irresponsible and horrific.
Counselors are okay; if you can, go to one.  A better idea would be find a way to suggest therapy for them. Even if they get a divorce, it'll help them.
As others have stated, if you need advice, feel free to PM.  Just keep in mind this - you expressed thoughtfully and with empathy towards your parents.  How would they write?  Viperbunny suggested therapy for you; I'm not a fan of therapy for children.  Your parents, however, could benefit from quietly discussing their relationship with one another in a structured setting.

Yes, but I might be leaving my school soon and I don't think they are a reliable place to go to for help.
I appreciate your advice, but are you sure? I don't think my parents enjoy it, and it happens very infrequently. Most of the time things proceed like normal.
Thanks for your awesome advice. Since then it has improved slightly, and if it ever happens again I will try to talk to them about it. To me it feels like they are not bad people, but don't really understand me. If it does get too far out of hand again, I was wondering if calling the police would be an acceptable solution? It seems drastic, but I don't really have anywhere else to turn at the moment.

BTW, this is another throwaway account, so that's why the username is different.

EDIT: I am not adopted.
It's possible they don't enjoy it, but being so inconsistent is either a severe lack of judgment or something worse. Either way I would talk to someone. 
Thanks for the advice!
Anytime. I hope things get better for you :)
When i was in sixth grade, my parents divorced and it was a really hard situation for me to get through. When they split up, my mom moved out and after staying at a few different places, she ended up living in a condo just about five minutes away from my dads house. This allowed for my brothers and I to rotate between her condo and my dads house fairly easily each week. After they had been divorced for a while, they each started seeing other people, which wasnt necessarily known by my brothers and I. My dad told my brothers and I that he was seeing  a woman only after a few weeks, and was very open to our opinionsof her and whether or not we had a problem with seeing her. Of course we were all fine with him seeing her. About a year later, my mom had been on a videocall with a previous coworker of my dad who lives a few states away. She told my brothers and I that she now worked with him in a company he owned. It wasnt until a month later and after hearing from others already that my mom told my brothers' and I that he was her SO and that she had been seeing him for years and she had left my dad for this man. There was a stage of anger coming from my grandpa who works with my dad and also worked with my moms SO previously as he felt betrayed by this man who left his business to create a competing company and then ultimately steal his daughter in law. This went on for about a year and caused a lot of stress for the whole family. During all this time my brothers and I continued to rotate between houses every other week. After a long while of this, changes had been made, my father almost lost our house twice because of problems my mother caused, and eventually his SO moved in with us there. The house is now securely ours but my dad still suffers financial problems because my mom has almost no financial responsibility of my brothers and I. I eventually became fed up with rotating between houses and suffered with my mom being fully defiant to me staying at my dads house any longer than the week I was scheduled to be with him, as she travels to her SO each week she is not with my brothers and I. This made it difficult to make schedule changes, as she bought plane tickets for each week to go and then come back from her SO's house. This past summer I stopped going to her house and she is constantly asking me to come to her house for two hours or so and I don't think its worth my time, nor do I want to go to her house any longer. 

TL;DR divorced parents, don't want to rotate to moms house every other week, dont want to go to moms house at all, mom keeps asking me to come back, dont know how to tell her and make her understand i dont want to come back.

Please help
I'm for your trouble. It would help to know how old you are. If you are a minor then you don't have much of a choice, I'm sorry to say. If the custody agreement states that you have to spend time there, then you have to unless it is going to create a lot of problems for your dad. Legally, he has to turn you over to your mother if that is the arrangement. The only way to legally change that is to go through the family court system. Since, I'm guess you are a teenager, your opinions should at least be considered, but a judge will decide what s/he thinks it best. While I can understand how frustrating that is, it is just how things are until you turn 18. Then you can do whatever you want.

You need to talk to your mom. You need to tell her why you are upset and why you don't want to see her. It may be best to write a letter, that way you can organize your own thoughts and say everything you need to say without being interrupted.

To be honest, while I understand your anger, it still seems a bit unfair. You have no problem with your dad moving on, but you expect your mother to stay single. I get it hurts that she left your dad for this man, but that is between her and your dad. You don't really know what was going on in their relationship. It's not for you to know. I'm sorry, but it's none of your business why your parents chose to get divorced. Their duty as parents is to do right by you and your brother.

I also understand that you are angry because she left your dad's company and helped her current SO with his new company. I get that people are resentful. Was she supposed to stay? Was she supposed to change careers and not work with competitors? Was she supposed to stay unhappy and have no way to support herself? Again, I get the anger, but it seems a little unfair. It was not HER job to make sure your father and his company stayed secured. That is on him.

Relationships are complicated. It sounds like both your parents were unhappy together and they split because they were better off not being in a relationship with each other. You seems to blame your mother because she left your father for this man. I get it. It may not have been the best thing for her to do, but her relationships are her business. As long as you and your brother are cared for, and she is doing her part to see that you two are good, then she is doing what she has to. It seems she was afraid to tell you what was going on because she feared judgment, something she was clearly right about.

Maybe I am missing something, but it seems like you want to make her suffer for leaving your dad and the company. That's pretty unfair. Try to see things from her perspective. You don't have to agree with what she did to understand why she did it. You sound like you are trying to spite her. I get being hurt, but you need to be the bigger person. Talk with her. If you can't get over it, then you need to petition the court.

Also, you may want to talk to a therapist. S/he could help you sort through your problem. A therapist could also be a mediator in a conversation between you and your parents. Either way, you are holding onto a lot of hurt and you need to find a way to get past it and be happy. Therapy is a good way to do it.

Best of luck.
You are going through a difficult time my dear. I'm sorry that your parents weren't able to stay together. I understand you are angry at your mom, and you deserve to be angry. You've been hurt, betrayed and possibly treated a little carelessly. It's very hard to understand everything that goes on with someone else - there are some feelings or choices the adults in your life have made that you might not understand because you've not been through a similar experience or you simply don't have the same ethics. Regardless, you are feeling very strongly about not returning to your mom's place, for the time being at least. If you cannot express your feelings on your own, you need to turn to a trusted adult, who can possibly handle the situation better than you can. Viperbunny is correct that your choices are limited, depending on the custodial arrangements. However, keeping that in mind, if you approach your grandfather, father or an aunt or a family friend, with your concerns by expressing, "I don't know how to say this. I am not really happy going to my mom's for now. I really need to spend time in one place for now. I' m afraid that I'll make her angry or upset you. But if I go, I am not happy, and she will know it, and it will make us both unhappy. How can I tell her?" You might engage them to be your spokesperson. Not every adult is brave enough to do this so don't be too disappointed. If that effort fails, write your mom a letter, a hand-written letter, not a text or email. Re-read your letter and make sure you are not being mean or angry. Focus on your feelings and write about your thoughts. Call her over the phone to discuss it afterwards. If you have had a chance to say everything, you might be open to listening to her side, too. Again, not every adult can handle rejection from their child; it will be very, very hurtful for them to hear it. The only way to get past this is to actually try to work through it. Again, find a trusted adult first, discuss your emotions; write a letter; or simply just wait this out, until you are older and try to be grateful for the time you have with her, while you have it.
Sit down and explain why you don't want to visit. I don't know how old you are now, but  your post makes you sound mature enough to handle it. Tell her your side of the story, and let her tell hers. Maybe she had her reasons, maybe she didn't, but it would still be good to hear what she thinks. 

Maybe you could let her move to be closer to her SO, teach her how to skype and have a normal relationship with her instead of avoiding her. I'm sure paying for plane tickets every weekend isn't a good move, and maybe she thinks she needs to stick around and be a mom to you. 

I'm in my 30s. My sister is in her 20s. We have multiple siblings between us and after her. I have a family of my own now. My children adore her.  

Background: She is convinced my mother was abusive and my father was absent emotionally. She is constantly messaging my parents or calling them, berating them and demanding they take responsibility for the "abuse" they inflicted on her. 

Now I don't know where she's getting this. My father coached both sports teams she was on. He also attended everything she participated in. My mother attended what she could during high school (there were small children at home). She attended all her events in college. 

Granted during the teen years for my sister, she and my mom butted heads. I did too when I was a teen. 

My parents are the most amazing people. They are incredibly kind and generous. They paid her way through school and still support her financially. My mother went with her to have her pet put to sleep because it was very ill and sat with her while she cried. 

My sister is offended because my parents are white (and were well off at one point). They hold fiscally conservative beliefs (fairly liberal socially), and she berates them for that. 

She and I recently had a blow out over Facebook of all things. 

Now on to my issue. My children love her. I don't want to keep them from her, but she is becoming more and more unstable to the point that I worry about how she will act in front of my children. She has already yelled at my husband in front of them because my husband asked for clarification on something to be sure we were  things to the kids properly. That was a while ago. She's accused me of withholding the kids from her to punish her (though that hasn't happened. She took them for a weekend against my better judgement). I don't want my problems with her to keep my kids from her, but I truly feel I can't trust her with them. I can't trust she won't speak poorly about the people they love and see everyday. I love my parents and believe her treatment of them is abusive. None of my other siblings have seen anything of what she's talking about and have nothing but love and respect for my parents. 

She has a lot of problems she needs to work out. That is for sure. She is being medicated and in therapy currently, but it really doesn't seem to be doing any good. My parents have apologized multiple times and have tried to talk to her calmly, but she always turns into a cussing ball of rage. 

So how do I do this? Do I break contact with her? Will that just cause more problems? Am I being selfish? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
I agree that at least for now you should try to limit her time with your kids, and maybe no alone time with them.

 It is vexing that her perception of your parents and her treatment by them is so different than that if you and your siblings. Maybe she has a biological issue. Or...

I'm reluctant to even suggest this, but is there any chance something did happen to her? Maybe a stranger or family member absurd her and she feels like your parents failed to protect her? I'm not legitimizing her conduct or suggesting one of your parents abused her but I can tell you that it's incredibly lonely to come from a family that outwardly seemed normal even though some bad things are happening. Good luck. 
I'm sorry for what you are going through.

The first thing you have to be concerned with is her being around your kids. This isn't about punishment, no matter what she tries to claim. It is about keeping your kids from being around her if she is unstable (she sounds like she is). It's not that you don't love her or that you don't want you kids to love her. It can be really confusing for them if your sister has a fit in front of them. She isn't going to take this news well. All you can do is tell her that you love her and that you want her to be a part of your kids life, but she has to be respectful of you and your husband. She doesn't have to agree with you, but she can't be contradicting either of you. She also can't yell at you in front of the kids. If she has a problem with you she can talk to you about it in private. If she cannot live by those rules, she can't be around the kids. That's tough, but your kids deserve the stability.

As for your parents, that's tough. The problem is your sister is perceiving slights that probably weren't there. It's harder to fix things when the problems are of her own making. All you can really do is support your parents, let them know you care. When she goes off about them you can tell her that you don't agree with her and you don't care to discuss it with her. It's hard because you don't want to insert yourself in their fight, but you can't support her being unreasonable.

I really hope your sister is getting help. It sounds like she is having some serious mental issues. Stay strong and do your best to keep your children out of the drama. They don't need to know what is happening. They only need to know they have family who love the. Your sister is accusing you of using your kids to hurt her. Don't let her use your kids to hurt you. Stay strong. Best of luck.
I honestly don't know. It could very well be. Her constant abuse mentions nothing of that sort, so I really can't say. I just don't get how out of so many kids, she is the only one who holds such contempt for them. My youngest sister was abused by an outside person, and my parents were very quick to jump into action. I have no doubt they would have done the same for her if she came to them with something. 

At this point she could be punishing them for something they aren't even aware of, but if that is the case, she needs to communicate that without the abuse. She has so much hate for my parents, and I just don't get why. 

Thank you for the comment. 
Thank you so much. I have a hard time when she attacks my parents. I am very protective of them. They are amazing people who would do anything for just about anyone. They have always (ALWAYS) put us first. I have absolutely no doubt in that. Neither do my other siblings. 

I don't want her filling my kids' heads with lies about their grandparents or anything else for that matter. 
Best of luck. It's a tough situation. I think some people have a hard time dealing with life and look to push the blame on someone. It's hard to admit you may have made mistakes. I hope she gets the help she needs. She is lucky she has a family who supports her.
It's too bad she doesn't think that. To her, all we do is abuse her if we disagree or call her out on her behavior.thanks again. 

the driving was unreal!  due to the weather, i did not make it to MI last night.  i ended up getting off the highway and checking into a holiday inn express in fremont, ohio.  wise decision.  look at the news, look at IL.  the rain was so thick, and the reflection of headlamps so intense, it was like driving in white out conditions! i somehow made it safely to a hotel and checked in.

i then spoke with grandma briefly yesterday. she kindly invited me to lunch on monday.  i happily accepted her invitation.

i saw grandma and grandpa today, monday.  i started crying when i walked down the hallway toward their room.  i instantly recognized the door by the rather large, bird embroidery piece hanging on the outside. 

i got it together, no more tears, then i knocked - out of habit.  of course they didn't hear it.  :)

a nurse/aid motioned that it was OK to go in.  i took a deep breath, got it together and went inside.  i saw grandpa asleep in the rocking chair.  they had both of their super deluxe rocking chairs from the farm house.  it was comforting and yet odd to see that.  i saw grandma next.  she was awake, apparently she just woke up from a nap.  she was immediately happy to see me. then realized she didn't have her wig on and started to pet her head/hair in embarrassment.  i paid it no mind.  

i gave them both hugs and kisses. i'm sure they rarely receive human contact aside from clinical touch, or a hug goodbye.  i tried to touch their arms and shoulders as much as possible - a means to show kindness, affection and much needed human contact.   

grandpa is so thin.  his face is gaunt. he was always trim - but he is gaunt now. both grandma and i teased him for clearly having the advantage of weight loss in the getting old process. 

grandma went into the bathroom to get ready - AKA put her wig on. i sat down, close to grandpa and tried my best to make conversation with him.  he would get about 3/4s through a sentence and then just fade out.  he did keep saying "you look just like..." and i would say "i am Amy". it went on like this for a couple minutes.

when we were looking at pictures, grandpa asked me if i knew who butch was.  i said of course, he is your brother.  this seemed to make grandpa quite happy.  he then pointed at one of the pictures and said, "i can't remember his name."  i made a mistake and asked grandma who the person in the picture was.  she said, "that is Dick.  he is my brother. he died a couple weeks ago."  i could see tears welling in her eyes.  it's moments like these that i go blank and find the most brilliant way to redirect the moment.  i'm not sure how i did it - but we got grandma talking about a much more happy memory.   

grandpa had a couple very lucid moments.  he would look deep asleep and grandma would ask him a question and he would respond.  he would sometimes open his eyes.  i'm not sure if he understood the question fully, or it was just an implicit response to hearing grandma's voice. 

again, he would look completely asleep, but when grandma would ask him a question, he would start rocking in his chair.  and with a select few silly questions grandma would ask, he would open his eyes, they seemed to twinkle and he would smile.  grandma asked him at one point if he wanted to dance to a waltz.  he opened his eyes and smiled. 

it seems if there is a STRONG emotional response to the present, grandpa would be shockingly lucid.

i arrived before 11am.  at 11:30-11:45 we started getting ready for lunch - which really means cleaning up oneself and a transfer from rocking chairs to wheelchairs.  i helped grandpa make the transfer.  i put out my arm to help grandpa standup.  grandpa point blank said, "i'm not that crippled!" 

something really intense happened next. before grandpa sat down in his wheelchair, he took both of my hands in his. he looked deeply into my eyes.  it took a while for him to form this sentence. again, with my hands firmly in his, and his eyes locked on mine he said, "you-are-so-pretty". i almost lost it. it was like having a dad tell his daughter you are the most beautiful girl in the room.  as quickly as he was there for that moment, it was gone.  he moved on to the goal of sitting in the wheelchair.

i then rolled grandpa into the bathroom and helped him wash his hands for supper/lunch.  the bathroom smelled just like the farm house bathroom.  did they use lava soap? it brought a rush of memories of taking baths on the farm. warm evenings, with crickets chirping and fireflies stuffed in bell jars.  

grandma was insistent for about 5 minutes that grandpa should change his shirt. i didn't want to interfere and was most curious to see how this would play out. she didn't think his shirt matched his pants. so she wanted to change it. i was not entirely comfortable changing grandpa's shirt (plus i thought he looked fine in what he was wearing - plus who the hell cares). i also thought there was no way grandma was going to help him change his shirt.  and i didn't think there was anyway grandpa could change his shirt.  after grandpa failed to respond, grandma eventually lost focus on this.

so grandpa does eat in a separate room from the rest of the patrons. an aid/nurse looked and me and with raised eyebrows said, "Emmet  eats in the daffodil room now." the daffodil room i do believe is the assisted eating room. it is a room of compromise. a room of perceived weakness. a room that clearly shows a transition in the living situation has been reached. 

i offered to wheel down grandpa to the infamous and foreboding daffodil room.  i rolled him into a room with 5 other elderly males and females sound asleep at the table.  i almost wheeled grandpa right back out of there.  the nurse/aid, started playing some music and began to take over her duties of the lunchtime routine.  i gave grandpa a hug and a kiss and departed to find grandma.

you know, you would think you could spot your own grandma in a sea of elderly people in a dining hall. turns out when everyone is in a wheelchair and with a white wig, it is not so easy! an aid/nurse escorted me to the appropriate table.  i met grandma's friend myrna apparently myrna and grandma knew each other through the farming community.  myrna had twin girls and the only way grandma could tell them apart was that one had short hair and the other had long hair. and these were their names - long hair and short hair.

oh yeah, grandma noticed my tattoo on my forearm!  she pointed it out to me quite a few times.  she then said that quite a few of the aids/nurses also had a tattoo!  i said i should become a part of the staff.  she said no, i should just move in.  i readily agreed! i said i would be more than happy to lie about my age and to not have to clean up after myself. both grandma and i found this as a huge advantage. not having to clean up!

grandma is convinced she is going back to the farm.  she, with a hint of anger/desperation in her voice, said she wanted to go back to the farm house and rip down the door that documented my brother Ned and my height throughout the years.  she made numerous references to going back to the house. she also thought she was in arizona last year. and she also thought Ned and Cathy were married last year.  she also thought They  will have incredibly intelligent children!  she then asked me if i was married.  i said no

grandma and i, however, giggled and giggled over lunch.  she would say something to show just how cognizant she is of her situation.  she explained why she needed to eat and she explained falling to me. if she does not eat a required amount of food, or fain eating, she will be moved into a DAFFODIL-like room. if she falls one more time, she will have to sit on a pad that beeps every time she moves (just like grandpa).  we joked about ways to outsmart the system or rationalize a happening to a nurse/aid.

grandma told her friend, myrna, to eat her lunch.  myrna was not hungry.  grandma said if she didn't eat, she would be moved to the daffodil room.  myrna took precisely one bite of food then moved the rest of her food around on the plate.  this made the kitchen staff happy. 

i showed grandma and grandpa pictures from the photo album of Ned and myself as babies.  many of the pictures are taken on the farm.  i would point out people and say, "this is Ned. this is Dan this is me.  this is Emmet. this is Betsy." grandpa would stare at some pictures intently.  and some he would flip past. 

grandma would sometimes recognize someone and sometimes she would nod as if she remembered - but i don't think she did.  the most obvious one was with aunty pink.  in one picture she asked, "who are these people?" i said that's Pearl and Sam she had no clue who i was talking about.  a couple pages later she pointed to Pearl and said "that's Pearl!". 

she couldn't put together that this was me as a baby at first.  then she said, "that's you and Ned. you guys look like brother and sister." 

grandpa was full on napping after lunch. so, grandma and i went for a roll around the facility.  i met one was grandma's old golfing buddies. they chatted with each other for quite sometime.  grandma proudly recalled the day she got a hole in one.

i was there for almost four hours. grandma started to look tired at this point too. she started talking about how she naps when grandpa sleeps.  i took the hint and started to make my way out. 

grandpa then perked up.  i gave him big hugs and kisses.  he said in a complete sentence to come back soon! i gave grandma big hugs and kisses.  i could see tears in her eyes.

there was so much more - so many nuances. grandpa - geez, i'm not sure if he has 24 hours, or months left. 

grandpa. his hands.  i have always been in complete awe of his hands.  those are farmer's hands.  those are hands that are the definition of blue color, integrity, strength, a different time. they are remarkably big and strong. and now, now they cannot lift a fork to his mouth.  this brings me to ruin every time i think about it.  i think about those hands toiling in the soil, holding a cup of coffee, fixing a tractor, holding his pipe and holding me as a baby.   

of course i left there in tears.  i remember the last time i saw grandpapa, walter, alive.  i remember giving him an extra hug.  somehow, i knew. i also felt this way with grandpa.  this was the last hug. i am so thankful to have given him that hug. i am so thankful for the last couple words i will hear him say to me. i am so thankful that they are my grandparents.

That was beautiful. Thank you for sharing it. It is so hard when our relatives get older. When my grandpa died it was a horrible realization that everything was changing. We were older. Our kids would be our generation, we were becoming our parents generation and our parents were becoming our grandparent's generation. This put so many loved one in the great grandparents generation and meant that soon we would be losing so many people we love, our responsibilities would be more, and things were never going to be the same. It makes me appreciate everyone all the more.

We never know when our last meeting will be. Always give a big hug and and an "I love you." Those are things you will never regret. I wish you all the best, and again, thank you for sharing this :)
So, this is kind of a long story, but I'll try to only include the necessary details. I'm not even sure this is the proper place to post, but I need help.

Three years ago, I graduated from high school and immediately moved across the country to get away from my family. I was raised in a very sheltered home because my mom and dad were hardcore christians. I followed this ideal growing up, but during my senior year I abandoned my beliefs because something didn't quite add up. 

I have three older sisters who all moved out before they even graduated for, I assume, the same reason; they wanted freedom. I also have one younger sister, she will be 10 in a few months. 

My parents divorced the year before I moved out and it was MESSY. My mom is still a strong believer but my dad has sort of backed off from the extreme Christian lifestyle. The divorce would have been fine since I was moving away and my older sisters were all on their own, but my younger sister ends up being the one trapped between the two parents and two opposing lifestyles. 

My dad is well off and lives in the city while my mother is struggling and lives way out in the country. I know this can't be healthy for my little sister because she spends almost equal time with the two of them, but they both treat her very differently. I would imagine it is tough for her to have friends outside of school.

I just got off the phone with my mother and it was heartbreaking. I guess, over the weekend, my little sister started throwing a fit and was screaming uncontrollably. My dad took her to the ER and they did many tests while my mom met up with them there. My little sister said to my mom she wanted to commit suicide. She wanted to "jump off a bridge and kill myself." Obviously, this may have been an overreaction on my little sister's behalf, but these are not thoughts a nine year old should be having.

I remember being very upset with my parents at times and thinking similar thoughts, but it was not until I was much older. 

Now I live about a thousand miles away. I love my family very much and wish I could be honest with my mother about the life I now live. But most importantly, I want my little sister to be safe and know she is loved. Reddit, what the hell do I do? 
I am so sorry for all you are going through. It is very hard when there is a big age difference between siblings, and not living there makes it even harder. All you can do is to be there for your sister on an emotional level. If you can, talk to her everyday, either online or on the phone. Let her know she can tell you anything. Just try to be there for her. One thing you may want to do is get her a journal. Having a private place to write down her feelings can be a great outlet for her. What she really, really needs is a good therapist. This can become part of the custody deal to make sure both parents are on board. All you can do is let her know she isn't alone and hope she can find her way. I wish you all the best. If you ever need to talk, please, PM me anytime. There is nothing worse than seeing someone you love suffering and having to sit on the sidelines.
I'm older, mid-40's.  My parents are in their 70's.  My relationship with them has never been great; in fact I moved across the country to be as far from them as possible.  They have done lots of shitty things to me; one of which was my father stealing my identity and running up hundreds of thousands in debt.  

We have lived our lives for the last 15 years away from them and things have gone OK.  Every few years we go back to visit them, they came to visit me twice (last time almost 10 years ago).  Our house has always been small and cramped, never had room for them really.  Now, a while back, we purchased a new home, over 2 times the size of our last one.  

We have lived in the new house for some time but my parents never knew until recently.  Now they are all excited they want to come 'visit' us. My mom has made comments well, I can cook and clean for you.  It makes me feel like they have no intention of ever leaving.

I do not want them to come, I like having my wife and kids isolated from them.  Too many lies from my parents, too much drama and bullshit.  But yet they are my parents.  I want to say please do not come; but they will throw a fit if I do that.  I can justify bringing the kids to them; but they will keep harping on coming out here.  

What do I do, what do I say, how do I tell them that I don't want them here.  Not now, not ever.  It's 2am and this has woken me up from my sleep worrying about it.  I don't want to cause any trouble to anyone, but if they come it will only be trouble.  If I tell them, it will only be trouble.  Please advise.
Is the reason they want to come because they think they can stay with you? If so, tell them they are welcome to visit but they will have to stay at a hotel. Tell them you and your family need space and privacy.  
I am so sorry for all you are going through. I know this can't be easy on you or you wife and kids. I think, as much as it hurts, you have to tell them they cannot come and stay with you. They have clearly taken advantage of you in the past and they won't hesitate to do it again (I really hope you reported your identity stolen and didn't have to pay all that money back). Be honest with them, but realize they are going to throw a fit, act like you are being unreasonable, try to bribe and emotionally blackmail you, and make you feel like a bad person for putting your foot down. You ARE NOT a bad person for keeping them away from your family and the life you have built. They may be family, but it doesn't make them good people who are looking out for your best interests. 

You're a husband and a father. You have to look at what is in the best interest of your wife and children. These people are toxic, which is why you moved so far away and why you don't want them near your family. You have to follow your instincts and if they are to keep these people at arm's length, then that is what you need to do. 

Think about what would happen if you caved. You let them come and stay, and they refuse to leave. Now what do you do? Do you call the police and get them removed? What kind of effect will that have on you? Your wife? Your kids? Also, if they stay for a few weeks, they could have tenant rights and you may have to go through the courts and have them legally evicted. Do you have the time, energy, and money to put into that while these people continue to live in your house? Given their history with stealing your identity do you really want to let them in your house where, with the right amount of snooping, they can get enough information to steal your identity again or find a way to steal from you (call it what you want, what they did was stealing. Well, I consider it worse because they stole something you didn't already have and would have to spend a lifetime paying back). They could even try to steal the identity of your kids (and that is unthinkable cruel and selfish).

How stressful would it be to have them in your home? Will you feel constantly on edge and unable to relax? What is that going to do to the relationship you have with your family? It sounds like a lot of stress. I don't know how old your kids are, but kids pick up on stress. Are they going be able to enjoy seeing their grandparents? Are you going to enjoy visiting with them or are you going to be watching them like a hawk and be counting the minutes until you are free of them?

It is going to be a shit storm either way. I think you have to accept that before doing anything. It's going to be messy and it's going to hurt.  What you have to decide is it better for them to be pissed off at you on the other side of the county or to fight with you in your home. 

You need to make yourself very clear. If you mean no, say no. Don't say maybe or make it ambiguous in any way. If you tell them they cannot come make sure to stick to it. If you feel you need to explain yourself (you don't, but I understand) do so. Tell them that while you care about them, they have not earned your trust. You will not be exposing your kids to this rocky relationship. They are going to come at you, try to talk about "all the good times" you had with them and "everything they have done for you." Expect to be called an ungrateful child and many other things. THIS SHOULD ONLY SERVE TO PROVE YOU ARE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION.

If you do decide to let them visit, don't let them stay with you. Make it clear that they will have to pay their own way (hotel, travel, food) and that you will be limiting the amount of time you spend with them and where you choose to spend time with them. If they don't know where you live, don't tell them. If you really feel they won't leave, don't let them into your home. Meet them at their hotel, or at a restaurant, but never in your home. They will pressure you to see it, but tell them no. Agree to what you and your wife are comfortable with doing with them before they come. Make sure you make it clear when you talk to them that they will have limited contact with you and the kids. 

Be prepared if they show up unexpected with suitcases. They sound like the kind of people who may not take no for an answer. That is not okay. Don't invite them in. Offer to drive them to a hotel, or ask them to leave. If they don't, call the police and have them removed. I know this seems harsh, but these people are not loving and caring and are trying to take advantage of you. You owe them nothing.

If you can't do it for you, do it for your kids. You know what having them in your life did to you. Do you want you kids to have to deal with that too? Be strong for them and protect them. You parents were willing to use your name to rack up debt. Don't expect them to have changed or to be above doing that to your children. It is up to you to protect them. You have felt the need to keep these people away from your kids and unless a lot has changed, you need to continue keeping these people at arm length. You may share blood with them, but that doesn't mean you owe them anything or deserve to let them treat you this way.

Whatever happens, good luck. I know this isn't an easy situation and I am sorry these people have put you in this position.


Edit: Thank you so much for the gold! It really isn't necessary, but I really appreciate it :D
Yes, I think that is the intent.  My wife and I are afraid that if they come, they won't leave.  I know that if I ask them to stay in a hotel they will flip out and whine saying that I have the room for them there is no reason that they can't stay with me.  But that's not the point, I just don't want them staying with me at all.
I couldn't agree with you more; every point was spot on.  OP needs to protect his family even if it means upsetting his parents.  
Thank you for your wonderful, supportive, kind and intelligent response.  Yes, you are 100% correct I have to be firm.  I will suggest that I will come visit them; they are claiming that they want to see me (it has been many years).  But I don't want them here, and I will have to tell them this.  Let the shit hit the fan, if they drop out of my life, so be it, it hasn't been like they have been in it anyway.  

I appreciate everything.  Thank you.
I think the fact they would put him in this uncomfortable situation (and make him feel like he can't say no) shows that they care about their needs first. 
Happy Cake day!

thank you!

Good luck. It is very unfair that you are in this position. It is horrible when you, their child, has to be the adult in the situation. 
Agreed, thank you.
Thank you!!  And good luck!  I don't envy your situation and hope you are able to come to a resolution without having to deal with too much of a backlash.  
There just happens to be 4 in my house me my wife one son and one daughter. We all also like playing Minecraft together on Xbox. With the 4 player split-screen and the fact that we are not killing each other but working together we like it a lot. What other games are there that 4 can play split screen and not kill or compete with each other?
Portal?
The Wii and the Wii U have a TON of family games.  My family and I play Mario Kart, Mario Party, NintendoLand (Wii U but so much fun!!), and Just Dance.
We have played portal its a two player game er portal 2 that is.
i love you
Our family doesn't get along and only pretends to at family functions. Everyone else has skipped out from time to time, but since it's my husband's mother who is guilted by her mother into hosting it, we have a hard time getting out of it. 

Neither of us are religious (I'm not even Jewish), and every time we go, we're subject to judgement about our mixed-religion marriage, why we don't have kids yet, etc. We really don't want to go.

We'd like to just tell the truth, but don't want to deal with hurt feelings on the part of MiL - whom we see every 2-3 weeks.

Can you help with an excuse that sounds plausible?
No need for made up excuses. Simply thank them for the invite, but you will be unable to attend. Wish them well & hope their dinner is a success. 
I strongly agree with aluatrill.  You can't please everyone and some people seem to live to refuse to be displeased.  It sounds like you're going to get shit whether you go or you don't, so you might as well please yourself here and don't go.  You don't need to lie about it.  

However, if you just can't bring yourself to do that yet:  Migraines.  I get migraines.  When I don't want to go somewhere, I can plead migraines and people always understand. 

If you can't bring yourself to be honest and set that boundary, I highly recommend you work towards being able to.  Saying NO can be a very powerful thing.  It's a great skill to learn to say it, especially to difficult people.
My mother, father, aunts, uncles, and a cousin are all deaf. I am what they call a coda (child of deaf adults). If that wasn't different enough. My Aunt is an artist, My Mom is retired with over 13 hernia surgeries behind her, and my Uncle is a deaf Elvis Impersonator. Yeah sometimes I think were pretty unique. Now that I am older I look at the younger guys and think what are they looking up to. I work at a deaf school, my three cousins lay carpet, interrupt, and sell art on eBay. No one impersonates anymore.
Awesome.  I wanted to see the deaf Elvis impersonator : (  
When I was young my cousins would come over and we would all play chef and we would make mud pies and such. One mothers day when the family gathered to cook outside for grandma with a grill. Me and my cousins added seasoning to everything because you can't have good brown gravy without sand, or green beans without grass. Yep that feast was a good one.
In my family we always sit at the table and eat together. Also afterward we tell stories of our days and what each of us have done. I believe the communication in my family brings us close.
roadtrips, chicken pox, and other rites of passage
I have 4 1/2 brothers and 2 1/2 sisters all of which i have hardly seen in my life. I am the baby of the family and they were already moved out when i came along. So they have not influenced my life in many ways. The one thing they have done for me is give me the thought what if I did know who they were and how would my life be different if I did have a relationship with them.
My older sister (2 years older) was quite the troublemaker growing up!  There were many, many nights of fighting between her and my mother where I would hear my mom say, "If you just didn't lie about it, you wouldn't be in trouble right now!"  Needless to say, I got away with A LOT growing up, because I didn't lie to my mother about what I was doing.  My friends all thought my mom was the coolest because I got to do so much.  They didn't realize that she had backed herself into a corner...I told the truth, so she couldn't be mad about me smoking, drinking, hanging out with boys.  I kept my grades up and always respected the curfew.  Yay me!

My little brother (7 years younger) has Down Syndrome.  I can't imagine what life would be without him!  From him I learned patience, tolerance and so much unconditional love and joy!  He's amazing! I know no other with such raw emotions and with such an interesting perspective on life. I've never treated him as a "special" child so he and I enjoy a very special relationship that differs from our other siblings.  We enjoy picking on each other and playing practical jokes.  When my father died, my heart broke more when I spoke with my brother than it did when I first heard the news.  I love that big-butted weenie!
I grew up an only child and met my 1/2 sister when I was 15. She had no influence on my life growing up and she didn't even know I existed until she reconnected with my dad.  

In our twenties we made a point to develop our relationship. Today she is the closest person in my life. Since then we have lived together, traveled together and now we have babies the same age.  

I guess what I am saying is that my life is different because I have a relationship with her, not because by chance we grew up together, but by choice to be close friends.
In my family we always have the party outside with two cakes. One is to fight with the other is to eat. 
For the record, my dad smokes heavily.

A few days ago and pack of cigarettes come through a load of "my" laundry (when I took the folded stack to my room, their were several shirts of my father's mixed in). The next day my mother says a pack of cigarettes came through the laundry. I just said "ok". I didnt really know how to respond as my father is the only person who smokes, so I figured she just put two and two together. She proceeded to tell me that I don't need to be doing bad things and should straighten up my behaviour. I replied that I don't smoke and the cigarettes clearly my dad's. My mother blows my response off, a half hearted "Yeah, sure. Whatever you say" I didnt want to take it further so I walk off. 

Now to give some more info, I do hang around my father quite a bit. He had a stroke and needs me to go places with him pretty often because he can't walk for very long distances, Balance is off, basically just needs someone to do any heavy lifting for him. He frequently takes me up to the gym, to saxophone lessons. In turn, I end up smelling like cigarettes and my mother understands this.

A day later, I am going upstairs after taking a shower, and my mother asks where my father went. I say, he went to the post office. Normal conversation, I go upstairs and get dressed, come back down. I tell her then I remembered he had actually said he was going to get a haircut. She then says "Sure he did. I guess as long as he gives you cigarettes you'll lie for him". I tell her that I have not been smoking and don't understand her saying I am. She says "I never siad you were smoking". I think her insinuation I was smoking is very obvious. I start getting emotional and slowly end up crying and saying things like I don't smoke because I have seen what cigarettes cause (stroke for example). I also say that I have too much too lose what with working out and playing sax. After me yelling over her and crying profusely, she gives me skeptical remarks like "I can't deal with you being this hysterical. You do what you want", or "I can't tell you how to make good choices when you're like this"

What am I supposed to do to get the point across that I don't smoke? My father has told her, even when they're somewhere private with each other, that I don't smoke. He knows my behaviour and he is alone with her when he tells her I'm not smoking. It's not like I'm their to contest anything if he said I did. He genuinely knows don't smoke, and has even had my two sisters also tell my mother this, but she doesn't believe them. Should I go buy a drug test kit and prove I don't do anything bad like smoking? It just hurts so much that my own mother doesn't trust her son who has no history of any habits like this.
Some people love drama and create it where there is none. Don't react. It is what she wants.
Does it matter is she believes you? Is there some punishment on you because she thinks that? Sometimes you cannot change a persons mind is why I'm asking. I understand wanting to be believed but sometimes it isn't worth the battle.
I guess I see what you mean. Besides, I already have my sister's and fathers belief. If she can't see past her own ego, then I'll just let her be.

I feel like my mom couldn't protect me in case something bad happens.I have nowhere to go.I dont know what to do.I need ur advice guys.


bruh
You need to have a talk with your mom when you dad is not there. You need tk be honest with her and let ber know you don't feel safe in the house while your dad is not sober and that you need her to step up and do what is needed to protect you. This could mean leaving dad for now. You have the right to feel safe. If she won't help tell a doctor, teacher, a camp counselor, anyone who is a mandated reporter. Explain what is going on and don't sugar coat it. Make sure they know the danger is real.
Your dad needs to go to rehab. Tell your mom you don't feel comfortable, and she better change that or you will leave.
thank you.at least  someone replied.
thank you so much. this mean a lot to me. 
Im 15 and so is my bro. Im gonna keep this short as possible. He is a piece of greedy, fat, loud, rude, annoying, arrogant, ass filled, greasy low self esteem power hungry shit who think he is hot shit and can walk all over everyone. He thinks like this because my parents dont allow me to hit him so when he is acting out and our parents are too busy working i can kick the shit outta him. Anyway he gets triggered by the most petty things imaginable and he is beyond stupid. He treats me worse than his classmates and never EVER EVER listens to me. I have tried being  nice to him, i have fed him several times, I try defending him when people critisize him but im stopping because he really really pisses me off, I have walked from the apartment where i live to school to bring his books to school and have tried asking him in a babyish way to help me do stuff (because at this point i think he is slow.) Any tips??? He is literally driving me insane and i cant take this anymore. If his behavior continues he will become a douchebag bully asshole who will like to use and manipulate people. He has done it to me countless times and CANNOT negotiate with me. 

Yesterday we went swimming and when we were done I wanted to shower first because he did 3 times in a row. We stood outside the door for 5 minutes without getting  anywhere and his excuse was "Sometimes, there are things you cant negotiate" then I just gave up and let him go first. 
You sound petty and immature. Do you think arguments should be settled by hitting? Do you think talking down to your brother is going to help? It won't. You are spreading animosity between you. You aren't really being nice. Your brother is different from you and so you treat him like he us slow. Why are you bossing him around? If your parenrs have chores for him to do and he doesn't do them then it is their job to deal with it. You have a lot of growing up to do and part of that is learning not to instigate your brother and then blame him when he bites.
You can chose, treat him with respect until he realizes it, or treat him the exact same way.
TThen what should i do when he bites???
Tell your parents and let them punish him. You can defend yourself, but attackinf him isn't the way to go.
I hate him so much. It's for various reasons, and it pisses me off. 
1. I'm 13, and I'm pretty sure us 13 year olds want our fucking space as do I. After CONSTANTLY and REPEATEDLY telling him to stop touching me on my waist/arms/legs, he doesn't listen and still does it. He can't even go about the situation with a adolescent teenager by giving me some SPACE instead of repeating an act that leads me to more isolation. 
2. He's always losing something. A 34 year old man can't even keep up with his car keys in a medium-sized townhouse! Nor can he keep up with his passport, wallet, or credit card! He's always leaving his phone somewhere and it's happening so frequently that it's troubling to see. You might say he's growing old, but I beg to differ. Im pretty sure a man with 2 part time jobs and another job should be able to manage where they leave their things. 
3. I don't want to full out blame him for this because it might be my older step brother, but I hate when my dad/sb comes in my room and move my covers off my body to (I'm going to guess) stare at my ass or something perverted. It's happened MULTIPLE times and when it DOESN'T happen I am aware of it. I know my sleeping pattern, whether it's at my mom's house or my grandmother's  house. My father is perverted as it is and had his bluetooth connected to some porn in the car before, and it played in the car until he turned it off and laughed about it. He's also like a man chiId who always thinks about ass and boobs and vaginas. 
I suspect my older brother because when I was about 9 he always tried to get a peek at my ass when I was trying to fall asleep, and I've caught him before but pretended to be asleep. I just had to move a bit and he left and gave up. Otherwise, this is extremely annoying. I'm eventually going to buy a camera or a video recorder to see who's doing this because it's become annoying. 
4. He's always so focused on MY opinions and decisions. He never cares about my step mothers or my step brothers, but he always puts mine first. It's always "should we do this, (my name)?" or "do YOU want to?" I don't think he's ever focused a decision on the whole crowd when I'm around. 
5. Like I said, he acts like a man child. BUT, he also relies on his mother for things he could handle on his own if he was knowledgeable enough. He's always going to her (specifically his mother but my grandmother) to either pay his bills or seek advice for raising me or dealing with situations I could easily solve if I had a child... For instance: You made a plan for the weekend with your half-family (what i call my step family) and yourself, the father. You're focused on 'redeeming yourself' because your daughter hates you so much (in your mindset, anyway)! You plan to go to the beach with them. Eventually everyone gets ready but your pubescent daughter has an attitude. You're easily influenced and angry like a child who's had his candy taken away from him. Do you cancel the plan for the day without the concern of everyone else? Or do you have a fit inside your head but brush it off and piss your daughter off even more?
Exactly. None of the options sound reasonable.

I'm sorry to go off on someone who's an 'important figure' in my life as my father never had one growing up. He also deals with anxiety but that is NO excuse as it's not like the excessive anxiety people have when they're scared. It's like when he's about to get on a roller coaster you get excited but that's what triggers his anxiety. He also does public speaking on the daily which doesn't faze him at all. 
I'm really ticked at this point and I either want something to happen or I'm just going to deal with it. I'm confused about any decision to make and overall, I just strongly dislike my father. 
The touching is a problem. If you don't want to be touched you have every right to say no. You need to tell your mom your concerns. Everything else is you being ovrr critical. Your dad works two jobs. He is tired and stressed and that is why it is easy to lose stuff. It is hard to concentrate when you have a lot of responsibilities. You are being unfair about that. You are 13 and honestly, it is a tough time. You need to learn to let things go and to be more mature. Cut your parents a little slack and drop the attitude.
Idk what to say about the other things but touching is a huge problem, and you need to tell them to stop, confront ur brother and tell him to stop, maybe tell ur mom just in case, anyway best of luck
Hi all, I'm looking for some help, my grandad, John Cullen, is very ill and we are trying to find his brothers James (aka jimmy) Cullen and Michael Cullen. As far as we know James was last living around forest hill, London, and Michael was around wicklow, Dublin. Please share and help us find them, it's urgent. Thanks.
Hey everyone, I believe this might be a small matter in comparison to what some of you are facing here, but it's something that has been bothering me since the beginning of my sentience lol. I'm 21 by the way, and a girl. 

&nbsp;

Well, I'm born to extremely conservative parents. They're not religious, but they live by 'Chinese values' to warrant why certain things should or should not be done, so they may as well be. Honestly as parents, they are very responsible in ensuring that we eat and study well and have all our survival needs met. However, I feel that they live by duties and obligations, like if I was not their daughter and they knew me for who I was, they definitely would not like me. 

&nbsp;

I as a person am more expressive and liberal. I'm not irresponsible, but I prefer flexible schedules and just enjoying myself as much as I can without neglecting my work. I have a girlfriend too, but of course my family hates her. Once when they found out, they threatened to kill her, and even made me go to a church and talk to a pastor when none of us here are christian. There was a period of time where I developed pretty severe anxiety from having to hide how I was living my life from them, who I somehow still feel heavily indebted to, plus some other factors. It gradually progressed to me feeling kinda suicidal at some point and they just got really angry when I confided in them about it. In retrospect, that's probably because it goes against their construct where I have to do my duty as a daughter-- to be part of this family unit and contribute to it. My mom is the kind of person to freak out at every single tiny thing. Eyeliner a tad too heavy, she berates me for two days about how I look like a slut. Even goes onto Google to show me 'proof'. 'Falls into depression' the one time I dyed my hair blue. Thinks the reason I cut myself is the same as why I got a tattoo, aka thinking I viewed my own self-harm as body art.

&nbsp;

My girlfriend on the other hand (I've been with her secretly for 3 years now) is the sweetest ever. We have never argued in the time we've been together and she understands me so much. She's very accommodating, fiercely loyal and financially supports me as I'm still in university. (My family is pretty well to do, but they only give me a small allowance every month, my girlfriend pays for most other things like outings, nice food and etc) Just everything I've dreamed of in a partner. 

&nbsp;

I can understand if I was 16 or so, because at that age a teenager would need guidance. And maybe now I might still be young too, but I'm looking at 3? 5? years from now. I'm not going to be youthful forever and I don't want to have my life curtailed under their beliefs. I feel as though they have kids (when obviously we won't know what kind of person the kid might become) and dictate, not advise, the way we live. 

&nbsp;

Is it right for me to want to just cut them off and live my own life? I've been trying to rationalise this as they've been really great at providing certain things for my growth. Yet again they're the ones who decided to have me and I wasn't the one who chose to be born, so it is only mandatory for them to be doing this or they'd be irresponsible right? I have to say I greatly appreciate them though, but there's no way I love them. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

TLDR:
You guys' opinions would be really welcomed, this is something that has been plaguing me forever. Whether I've the right to just live my own life or am I bound to them because of what they've did for me during my upbringing.
I do believe that you deserve to be free to live the life you want.  I can't leave a more detailed comment rn, but I'd suggest going to listen to That's Deep Bro podcast by Christina P.  She's all about getting your life.  Don't let them hold you back girl. Where you come from mustn't determine where you go.  I promise I'm not a hundred years old.  Mustn't just worked so well there.  Lol
Thank you for the response! I might just do that without consulting them... Because if I did, they'd lecture me on how my actions and life would affect them. Which is kinda true though and why I've been really hesitant
You're right. This decision will/may not be without consequence. Let my experience be just one example and a different situation than yours, but at 18 I moved out. We fought hard the night before. There were tears and words exchanged (and for us, this was the most important piece. It's not a night I would ever return to. Watching your mom cry is the fucking worst. But in the end, we both got to say how we felt, and both expressed our love for each other)...but now only 3 years later, she comes to me for advice. She's seen that I'm the level headed sibling who can handle herself. Sometimes drastic measures get points across better. At the end of the day, you love them and they love you. But you're right when you said it was a dutiful relationship. Our parents gen. only focused on keeping food on the table. I believe we are the loving/nurturing gen. We want what's best for everyone and understand that our kids may leave us to go live in their corner of the world. Or at least I do. Because now SO and I are planning our move across the country. We have to go, it's where we want and need to be. Family will be okay. It's sad, but they should all want you to be self-sufficient and satisfied.
I'm really not good at curating my ideas into comments. Sorry. Lol.
The problem is that my parents dont support me in anything. I've wanted to buy a guitar for 8 months (with my money) but i dont want to ask my parents right away becayse i'm 99% sure they will say no. I ve asked them before and they said no. The thing that gets me mad is that i have never aked them for money or anything the only hobby that i have is playing computer games and i dont do almost anything else so i wanted to learn guitar just to do something else in my free time. I also have a sister she is 3years older than me and she is 18 and she travels a lot (with my parents money) they bought her a car and she doesnt work. I hate it they give her everything and spend so much money on her but when it comes to me they dont even let me buy a guitar with my own money. they love her a lot more than me. for example her birthday gift was the car and they also gave her jewery and gave her money to pay the bills for her birtday party. On my birthday they didnt give me anything and i didnt even celebrated it and all i got was "happy birtday" from my mom and my father didnt even know that i have birthday. What should i do? i have good marks in school i dont ask them for money i dont go to partyes. What am i doing wrong??
Maybe is that you don't do anything to worry them, so they take you for granted, in the worst way possible. I'm not saying you should start taking drugs or anything, but step up your ground, make them hear you. If you talk back to them with good arguments, maybe they'll start listening to you. 
If you have your own room where you can store the guitar just ask them. Im quite curious why they dont want you to buy the guitar for your own money. Id simply ask them if they said no i would ask why and go from there....

My husband found out last spring he has a 20 year old daughter he never knew about. She contacted him through her cousins family and mutual friends, she came to visit (most awkward weekend of both our lives), they did a DNA test, and voila, 99.9% certain. She only wanted to know who her bio dad was, and not much of anything else...he's never told anybody about her, including his other kids, or family. Only I, and his brother know because it slipped out to his brother one day. I know that they would all be so hurt to know that this happened and he never told them. Regardless of the "secret  daughter" not wanting a relationship with them, it still feels wrong nobody even has a clue she exists. His kids even asked him who she was because him and her are friends on Facebook and she came to visit us and his other daughter even met her because she came with a friend they knew (another long story). She friended her on Facebook. He even congratulated "secret daughter" via phone call on her recent engagement. It's  the craziest, confusing, most messed up situation. He hates talking about it and it's a very sensitive subject. I know it scared and surprised him but I just felt there are better ways to handle it. I ask why they still talk and communicate if there's never a chance of relationships for anyone, and nobody can know, yet everyone sees what they like and comment on each other's Facebook. what's the point?  It seems so deceptive to me. Not sure how to deal with it anymore.
That would bother me too. It seems like he wants to habe a relationship with her, but not acknowledge her. It is pretty unfair. It is going to come out eventually. These kinds od things always do.
it's exactly what it is... I've asked him why they still are friends on fb and selfomly talk/message but neither of them want any sort of relationship and nobody knows who she is and he doesn't give me an answer.. I just wonder what the point is especially when she's right there in front of everyone and his daughters and her have even commented back and forth on fb posts and what not! She knows who they are, they don't know who she is. It's  a sore subject but it bothers me a lot.....
It would bother me too. When it blows up it is going to be bad. I say when because secrets always come out.
While they continue to reminisce about everything and tell eachother stories i myself have heard atleast 53 times..... halp
Its been atleast a minute and its felt like years... sos
I'm 17 and my mom died when i was 15 and i stayed with my two sisters who are now 20 and 21 and well my dad is a d*** and so is he's gf and my sisters act more of a parent to me than my dad does. My sister provides food for me, signs paperwork which he needs to sign and does anything my dad should do and i was wondering is there a way my sister can become my legal guardian. I'm from the UK btw
I wish I could answer for the UK, I know in the US it is possible provided the parent signs over guardianship.
I'm 29, my Parents split up 20 years ago, he married in 2013, got divorced 2 years later and now he'll marry again.

We barely have contact anymore. Last time I saw him was in february or march and now I got the invitation in my mailbox.

I really don't know what to do. 

First of all it's his life and I'm not judging but it didn't work the first 2 times so we all agree that a third time isn't the best idea. I'd attend a wedding that I don't agree with. So why go there in the first place?

Second, the woman he marries and her children (3 girls between 18 and 22)... not that I don't like them, I just don't care. Zero interst in them from my side. Sitting at a table with them I feel like an alien and so does my sister. It's like two different worlds are colliding.

Third, as I said we have almost no contact. That all started when he met his now fiance. He also always had a strong drinking habit (destroyed his car a day before new years eve driving drunk, got his license revoked, is still drinking way to much) and I experienced some major crap because of that in my younger years. I guess that's the reason why there's no contact from my side. Don't want to be part of that anymore.

On the other side, he is my father. If it wasn't for that I'd already said no thanks and went on but I don't now.

Any advice from you?

Should I go no matter what or is it okay to be polite and say no?
I say you go, for one reason and one reason alone. Be a gentleman, my entire life I was a nice guy. Nice guys think good thoughts gentleman actually do them. Once I turned 30, I came to this realization that I need to be a gentleman for the simple fact I want my boys to be, I want my girls to see what a gentleman is. 

Imagine 15 years from now, somehow you and your father have some sort of relationship for what ever reason. Your kids are looking at pictures and they see you aren't at his wedding. What would you tell them?

Second reason

Your father has a drinking problem yes. I had a severe eating problem, I was 306 lbs at the age of 30. I am now healthy and fit now, I believe that people need to see something in their life that's worth changing for in order to change. The problem is sometimes those things are right infront of us and we just can't see them clearly. Your dads drinking and the need to remarry might stem from a deeper issue. My eating issues sure had their reasons, and it took a lot of time and effort to be overcome them.

It's just a thought, I can't imagine what you went through as a child, I have a great father my only issue with him when I was younger was he worked way too hard all the time to provide for his family so I didn't get to see him a lot. 

But this is just my perspective looking in, at the end of the day nobody can force you to go, you shouldn't go just to go. But at the same time you should have a reason to go, and at the same time a good reason not to go of you decide not to. 

Sorry I know not much help, just more shit to think about.
It is definitely ok to not go.

He may have fathered you, a father he is not (going on the information you've given).

Only go if you want to go, for you, not out of guilt or pressure.

Just because someone is related by blood, that does not make them family.
If you don't want to go then that is understandable. It sounds like your dad hasn't been a great dad and that he is making bad decisions. If you will feel guilty then go for you. You don't have to go for him.
It looks like your decision is to keep your dad in your life or drop him for good. If you don't like being around him, then you don't have to. "He is my father" is not enough of a reason, there are some rather unpleasant fathers. 
So I have an aunt and uncle. They have always been very kind to me, but the fact of the matter is, they are both pretty racist, and they've raised their children to be too. I currently live halfway across the country from my parents, and this aunt and uncle the closest (distance-wise) relatives to me.

Two years ago I went to Thanksgiving at their place, and while they were incredibly gracious hosts, they expressed some world views that just shocked me and made me extremely uncomfortable. Last year I told them I couldn't come "because of work". Especially in light of the current US political situation...I really have zero desire to see either of them.

Anyway, my aunt e-mailed me a few weeks ago to say she will be staying near my city in August for a conference and would like me to meet her for breakfast. She said she is staying 45 mins away from me - but she doesn't know that I moved to a different neighborhood, so she is actually staying 1 and 1/2 hours away from me. Gas is expensive in my city, and I don't really feel it would be at all worth driving that far and spending that money on gas to see her to just sit through a meal where I already know she will say things that make my blood boil.

Is it wrong to lie and tell her I am busy that weekend and can't see her? Do I need to suck it up and go because she's family and has been shown great hospitality to me in the past?
I mean you could use the distance to say no? It's in your benefit that you now live farther. 

You can say no if you want but you may be causing more family issues so you need to think of potential consequences (by that I just mean drama) and if you want to deal with that. 
Breaking from family is not something to be taken lightly.  What have they done/said that makes you label them as racists?
I mean, surely they have other things to talk about? Just ignore the racial stuff no matter how aggravating and focus on something else. 
Have you tried confronting them on the racist points? Because it will be a never ending of excuses from here on. If you confronted them and it gets messy, at least then you have a real excuse to not see them again. Even if they are good people, if they are racist, I would not want to be around them either. 
Hi everyone. I´m new here,  i was just reading your stories, but I think it´s time to submit and share my own story.
First of all, I would like to apologize for my english. I started to learn eng for 4 years ago, so please, be kind and try not to see all the mistakes. Thank you :) 

I´m gonna share my story with you guys, because I want to know, if I am the crazy one, or if there is something wrong with my brother. Because I want it to be anonymous (he´s maybe reading reddit, you never know), I´m gonna use fake names and fake countries.
My name is Emma and I´m 26, my husband is Zender we are czech, but we are living in Norway for 7 years.
My brother is Tim 32 and his wife is Mary, also czech, they moved to France 3 years back.  
My husband is coming from a poor family, but because he was always very diligent and he wanted to achieve something, he was working hard to get himself out of poor conditions, to get a good education and live. Me and my brother, we are from OK family. Not poor, not rich. Classic. 
My husband Zander managed to set up an IT Startup here in Norway for ca 5 years ago. We have been going through a lot of s..but we managed to find out things. Today he´s a succesful businessman with a lot of customers, and our living standard is much higher compare to how it was. We had almost nothing and we had to lend money from the bank to be able to move here. 
My brother and his wife, they moved to France few years back. She´s not working, he´s working, He just got a new job with an excellent salary. But still lower living standard than what we have. The reason I´m explaining this is, that I have a strange feeling he could be envious, but not sure. Here is why....
When we moved here, Mary and Tim were supportive. They were acting, like they are happy for us. The relationship was okay. Skype,phone,emails .Everything fine.  We visited them in our homecountry in 2012 for Christmas. 
Since that, our relationship is going down. We were calling, texting each other but it was like kind of okay. Until I realized in 2013 in May, that they are getting married. I found out accidantly 5 days before getting married. Of course, he didn´t even invite me nor my husband. We don´t know why yet. Step by step our financial situation was getting better and better. I studied norwegian language, my husband was working, then I started to work for him, we travelled to different destinations like Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, USA, Kenya.... so ot was reallly good. The strange thing was, that week after week, month after month, my brother changed. He wasn´t concerned about my situation, health, job, if we want a child or anything normal between siblings. He was constantly asking about money. How much is our car, how much is my husband cell phone, how much we need for food per month, how much was my jacket, how much is my new laptop.. this was going on for like 2 years. Every single day. I was like´WHAT? There is nothing else in this world, only money? ... In the end of 2015 our parents got divorced. After divorce my mother stopped speaking to me and my brother was contacting me only a few times. Like 2 or 3x in a month. Last year in May i found out what happened. I had an mortgage account in Czech Rep. and my mother had access to it. I let her offically have access, because I didn´t want to fly back everytime from Norway, in case that something happens to the apartment. We were sending there money with my husband to have some savings in case we decide to sell the apartment. You know, some safety. Last year i found out, my mother was stealing for me since we moved to Norway. She stole something about 8000Euros from me, and she took some bank loans for over 20 000EUROS behind my fathers back. When I found out,I was schocked, angry, dissapointed, crying. I asked my brother if he knows something about this situation. He denied. I asked him, if he was getting money during the 7 years, he said no. And he doesn´t know anything about it, and he doesn´t want to be a part of this because he´s got his own life and problems to worry about. I was like, hm okay thank you very much for your help. 
Today I don´t speak to my mom, and of course I never will. I kindly asked her about this, was expecting some explanaiton, but she denied and wrote a text message: Leave out my son of this and my daughter in law. The only people I care about are my grandchildren (my brother has a little son and a newborn baby). And if I die, I don´t want you to come to my funeral. 
I haven´t heard from my mom for a year. I feel still hurt and sad, and also angry. My husband is of course supporting me.
Since that our relationship is bad. Mary doesn´t speak to me nor to my husband, actually for years. We never talk about her. She´s a manipulative selfish woman. Looks like she´s also manipulating my brother, because he suddenly stopped to speak to our dad after divorce and I know they have great relationship to our mother.
My relationship to my brother became very narrow. It´s about hi, i got a new job, i am gonna make 7000EUR per month, i am gonna be rich, i am gonna pay my mortgage, i am gonna get a new BMW blah blah blah. All the same over and over and over again. To me, and to my husband the same blah blah on Skype every day. Nothing like how are you, are you feeling great, is there anything I could do for you? How is your husband? Forget it people. Nothing like that.
We actually got a brand new AUDI in January, maybe that´s his problem. I really don´t know. 
My whole story is about money, I know. But that´s the only thing my brother is talking about. That´s the reason I´m talking about that as way.
We invited them last year to our house, or asked them to come to Switzerland to visit us, because we will be there. Brother said, no because CH is expensive they can´t afford it. My husband said no problem, we pay for everything, Only come to visit us. They after I received a message on Skype from my brother. We are not coming in July, I am gonna be busy in my job.
I haven´t seen my brother and his family for almost 5 years now. We invited them millions times, there is always a reason for NO. Looks like, they´re avoiding us.
He says, they have a newborn baby, it´s too young to fly. But they´re going to visit his parents in law, driving 1500km. That´s okay. 

Now a really don´t know what to think. What do you think is his problem? If you need more details, please let me know.
I was crying again today, because I wish I could understand..but I don´t ;( 





[deleted]
They are jealous and that is really sad. You can't change their minds and they sound petty and materialistic.
Thank you.

Yes it looks like, they´re against us. All of them. Because my sister in law loves money. I am totally sure about that. 
Thank you for your kind words. 
I still can't believe that ;( 
What would you do instead of me? Ignore him and his wife or? I don't know what to do. 
I would ignore them, but that is me.
What if he contacts me first? For example on Skype? or phone call.. so you would completely ignore him right?
That is your call. I may act civil unless he brought up your mom or money, but it is absolutely ok to ignore him completely.
(Sorry for my bad English) So, i'm from Latvia... me and my dad have had a strong relationship through my life, but i'm worried that it might change soon...you see i have been playing hockey since 4 years (i'm now 16) I've never been super good id say i'm decent... you should also know i'm very good at school. about a month ago i got an offer from a team to go to their school learn there, practice there and play there... but that costs a lot money and the school is not very good... so i had a choice stay here in a good school and don't play hockey (well not professionally anyways) or go to that team... i think that my future is not in hockey as there are some many player just like me and better so i made the choice to stay here... My dad is very upset and kinda mad right now... i think its cause he wanted me to live the dream he could not as a child... i hate not having a good relationship with him... is there something i could do to change that ?
You made the smart choice. You dad is trying to live his dreams through you. He needs to work this out because it is unhealthy. You are already more mature than your father.
I just found out someone in my family has hidden cameras all over their house (bedroom/s, guest bathrooms, living room etc.). We used to visit at least once a year to this house for the family reunion (lots of women and young children), but often times would go visit them more than just once a year. I know now, that those hidden "clock" cameras were in place while I was there (showering, using the toilet, changing my clothes/swim suit, having sex with my husband etc.). His wife found out the cameras and confronted him about it. He had no valid excuse for needing cameras in some of those locations. She demanded access to the cameras, but she hasn't had time to view any footage to actually see what might have been on there (such as her best friends or his sister). His wife had confided in me that he is a sex addict. Here's some more complications, this person is a saint in his mother's eyes (the grandma and matriarch of the family) and anything wrong he does, she has an excuse for. He's living in his mother's million dollar+ house. He recently got arrested for drunk driving (his second DUI) among other assault and weapons charges so everyone in the family is treading lightly around him because he's "going through some difficult times." He's been a drunk for ten years now and I have tried to talk to the family and stage an intervention numerous times prior to this DUI to no avail (obviously). We have the annual family reunion coming up this summer and my husband and I are not planning on going. We have a young daughter and I do not feel comfortable being around this person anymore. I've tried to talk to the wife, I suggested couples counseling at the very least. She won't leave/divorce him under these circumstances alone. Besides avoid the family, what can I do? I feel compelled to tell the other women in the family about the cameras, but I don't want to put his wife in a bad position for confiding in me. If she stays with him, I'll need to keep that trust because I am the only person in the world besides my husband that she has told about their relationship issues and other abuses going on. Please help, any advice?
Um, yeah, people deserve to know. 
I agree. Now I just have to figure out how to inform people without burning that bridge. 
Please be advised that there is content which is not suitable for underage views and my English isn't perfect. 
I know this might not be the place to ask this sort of question but bare with me. It's been 7 years since too families came together one side European(my mother, me and other brothers) other side Indian(father, brothers and the sister). Since I'm so open to everything, funny And caring everyone liked me in the family especially my sister. Me and her over the year grow a strong bond that of which was stronger then brother-sister love. Now please keep in mind our father is a stronger believer in the Indian ways of no sex before marriage and it's a big no no to lose your virginity before you get married. A few mouths ago I got a girlfriend which made my sister jealous but at that time I didn't know why after 2 week of my relationship she confessed her feeling being” I like you more then a brother” honestly I felt the same way and said I like you too. Fastfoward 1 week she kissed my in bed (once) I was shocked and didn't know what to do keeping in mind that I'm still in a relationship and it's forbidden love. Me and my gf broke up which made my bond with my sister-in-law even stronger. We decided to go (as a family) on holiday to one of the holiday home by the lake front. So much happen on that holiday we will first begin with the topless selfie video she sent me and taking about our fantasys we were talking over the phone (snapchat) untill 3 am then she asked me “can you reach me to kiss” and I relied “now?” Which was my invitation to the upstairs lounge which was where she was sleeping. We kissed, kissing lead to touching but I had to stop there being she started moaning and I didn't wanna get caught. Fastfoward another week she wanted to play again so I snuck into her room at 3 and played this time I was on top of her and she wanted to be on top of me.more kissing but she still had pants on we finished our playtime at 4 and the next day I told her to wear a skirt and nothing else. We started playing at 3 kissing touching keeping it above the waist untill she wanted to be on top of me which gave me more room which I took advantage of and slipped my hand under her underwear you know the rest. She then asked if she could see my package which being the stupid horny kid I said yes. She pulled my pants down and grabbed it. After 20 seconds she asked if she could suck it which yes of course skip to the next day. I asked her if she would lose her virginity with me and she said yes..


Honestly, this os going to end badly. You will get caught eventually. Even if you don't, where do see this relationship going? When it ends it will be bad for both of youm this needs to stop.
I think you should think about your brother.. her being between you will ruin three relationships. Yours with her. Hers with your brother. And your brother with you. Not worth it. I hope there is someone out there better for you than your sister in law...
I understand what you mean. Honestly I dont see it going anywhere because of my position that being the brother in a religious family. I don't know how to end this
So, it's probably taken me close to a year to have the balls to try and tell this story. Since the first incident, more has occurred. Today, as i was having dinner with my in-laws, I decided that I need to get this off my chest to a community of people who can either relate, feel my frustration, or even comment things I wish I could say. 

It starts like this. I have been married about 3.5 years now. I moved away from home roughly 3 months after I got married to live with my husband, (who was in the Army) a few thousand miles away from our home town. 
The relationship that I had with his family was good. His mother didn't approve of the wedding at first, but his dad and step-mom did. They were full on supportive, and welcomed me with open arms. His mother didn't hate me, she just wasn't ready for her son to be married. She is very practical. I obviously was hurt, but she soon changed her tone. 
The problems started after maybe 2 years of being away from family. Because we were so far away, we became a bit secluded. We didn't text very often, due to time difference and schedules being completely unknown. They had two young kids, and by the time we were home from work, had dinner and relaxed, it was past the time we could contact them.
We both had members of our family pass away. We were thankfully able to go home for the funerals, etc. 
I have really bad anxiety and depression. Being so far away, I kind of lost myself a little bit. Between losing my Aunt, my pet bunny passed away (hubby and I got him when we first started dating, but couldn't move with him, so my family kept him for me) and my mom was diagnosed with cancer. I was in a very very rough spot. My depression got so bad, I was put on medicine. The medicine helped for about 2 months, and then I started cutting due to the side effects. This went on for about 2 months before I told anyone. My husband was devastated. My mom, sister (who dealt with self-harm before) and dad supported me, scolded me, tried to get me to see that I needed further help. 
Fast forward a month. It's now the month of May, 2016. I posted a bit too many "dark memes" on facebook. I opened up too much, about my personal issues. I own up to that, and I have since then fixed those issues. So, I'm laying in bed with my cat, and take a selfie because he was being cute and cuddling me. 
1. I'm sick with really bad allergies.
2. I am drugged up due to said allergies.
3. It's slightly dark and I'm not paying attention to the picture I post on FB.
This picture turns out showing some of my cuts on my wrist. Now, I don't usually over analyze my photos because of self esteem issues, I just post them. 
A "family friend" who is dating my husbands best friend comments and asks if my cat scratched me. (BACKSTORY: When my husband left for the Army, he asked his dad to make sure his friend was okay. They clicked and so the best friend and his gf became really close, almost as surrogates for my husband and I) I click on the picture, see the cuts, and immediately delete the picture.  I message her informing her that I removed the photo because I didn't realize the cuts were showing and that I was going through some things at the time. 
SHE BLEW UP ON ME.
Told me that I was attention seeking, needed to get help, had been doing this for years, how dare I post on facebook knowingly about my self harm, and she needed to delete me off Facebook because I was depressing and bringing her down. 
I mean, okay. Fine. I get it. Completely uncalled for, but sure. 
What REALLY hurt me, was my father in law and his wife called my husband to yell at him, basically saying I wasn't pulling my weight, and needed to get my shit together. Then IGNORED me for a full month, only to text me a week before we went home for vacation to tell me that they didn't appreciate what I did and that we'd talk in person when we flew in. 
Yeah, that never happened. They pretended it never happened. And I am too much of a little bitch to start any sort of confrontation. 

Okay, so that happened. We forgot about it. Now, let us fast forward to October, 2016. I flew home until early Dec. to try and figure out living arrangements for after Army. I wasn't very social with hubbys family because it was awkward, since they went out EVERY weekend with 'family friend girl'. SMIL (step mother in law) and her became almost inseparable. Mind you, there is probably a 15-20 year difference between them. They invited me out a few times, I had to decline. In November, my phone service was shut off and I never received an invite for my baby brother in laws bday. I saw on FB I missed it, and IMMEDIATELY messaged SMIL to apologize and explain. No answer. Okay. Saw them for Thanksgiving. Things were okay. I was told to never be a stranger because they want me around. Thought things were good.
We've been back home (out of the Army) since Dec. 2016. We've been struggling to find work. Very sad, but also thankful that a situation happened and my parents needed to move out of their house, and someone to take over. My husband and I agreed. It's a free place, we can save money faster, and it helps my parents. My two younger siblings (19, 20) live here too. I'm 23, and my hubby is 24, btw. So, it's like having roommates. 
Anyways, so I posted during a nice day that I was going out with my siblings. I don't smile much due to a missing tooth. Just super self conscious about it. 
SMIL commented and told me to be happy I was still alive. The way she worded it definitely hit a nerve with me and all my facebook family. They commented, so I deleted so no drama would happen. (My family is VERY overprotective and dramatic) I texted SMIL and asked her if everything was okay. No answer. Texted again an HOUR later, said I didn't appreciate her being negative towards me. She finally responded to me, going off (meanwhile, 'family friend girl' is posting online about how negative people continue to do the same stuff. Meme directed towards me. I cried for probably an hour. I was told by SMIL, that I was negative and it was the same old same old with me. That I needed to stop bringing the family down on social media. They asked me and hubby to stop over. I agreed.
WORST MISTAKE EVER.
They called a 'family meeting'. Invited 'family friend', grandma and us. 
We get there, I'm sweating bullets, shaking, and want to vomit. They told me this was a long time coming. 
I sit down, and SMIL starts by saying,
"So, I'm the bad guy here because I called $#%@$ out on Facebook about what we've all been thinking."
I'm speechless. I literally stood there with my mouth open. 
She continues on about how the whole family is worried about hubby because I'm so negative and it affects the family name. People always ask what's wrong with me, and THE BEST:

"What has our son gotten himself into marrying you?"

Everyone basically told me that I'm the same old sob story, and that something had to change, or we had to go our separate ways. 

Mind you, this is over a picture of me, enjoying the sun, but not smiling... 
I obviously said nothing, because I never do. My husband also didn't say anything because he also got scolded for being a working adult who also is trying to re instate himself into a world that isn't the ARMY. 

Statement: We were told that if we feel replaced by "best friend" and "family friend", its because we left... 

Actual fact: We got stationed 2000 plus miles away. I wasn't going to just leave my hubby there by himself for 4 years. 

I think that's about all I have to say about the situation. Things are awkward, and when we get together, I try my best to put on the most fake smile for them. Because I love my husband, and I will do whatever it takes to make sure he has a relationship with his family. 

Do I enjoy it? HELL NO. 
Does my family support my decision? Again, HELL NO.
But what am I to do?

Sincerely, 
The Silent Girl


You guys need to unfriend these people on Facebook. LL OF THEM. Cut contact. They are not helping
 They are toxic. They seem to think they have a say and can tell you what to do and tell you hoe to feel. It will only get worse. 
I think it's time you and your hubby called a family meeting to announce A) you are two fully-grown adults who shouldn't be scolded like children, or told what to do, and B) you are happy to be part of the family, so long as it's on YOUR TERMS, and c) if the rest of the family isn't happy with your terms they can go fuck themselves.

In short?  It's time to put on your big-girl panties and start making a life for yourself and your husband that does NOT include his family.  By this I mean friends, people your own ages that you can hang out with.  For the anxiety stick with a therapist, but when things start feeling too much for you just ask yourself one question -  Will the sun explode if I do/do not do this/that?  Because if the answer is 'Nope' it's not important enough to worry about.  ONLY the eternal things matter, sweetie.  Ten, fifteen years from today you'll remember this present time and the problems you have/were having, and you'll shake your head, wondering how could you have ever been so young?!  Take it from on who has been there and back again, okay?  The only way you and hubby are ever going to get his family's respect is if you STAND UP to them, and let them know where the boundary lines start, and end.   Oh, and go get a dental implant so you can smile!!  I'm in the process of getting dentures so I can smile again, because I'm sick and tired of my raggedy grill lookin' so bust all the time.  Get the tooth fixed, then post a pic of you and hubby alone on a weekend getaway, with you smiling like the Cheshire Cat.  LOL 
I already deleted all of them on Facebook. It was getting too frustrating when I felt that I couldn't post something. It's just funny how people change.
My father has been in a relationship ( not married ) with this woman whom I have grown close to, and has been living with us for awhile. I'll just call her my step mom, because I don't what else to refer to her as. 




Anyway, my father has been out of town for a few days, so it's just me and her. Yesterday, me and her got into a bit of an argument, nothing tooo serious though. This was the first argument we had, in general we usually have a very solid relationship. It started when I came down stairs to get my breakfast, I noticed she was a little short with me. She wasn't being nasty or anything, but I could tell she wasn't exactly happy, and she wasn't saying too much to me. Then she asked if I could vacuum upstairs and downstairs so when my dad gets back later tonight, the house would be clean. 




I said I would but I took her demeanor  a little personal so I thought to myself ( psshhh yeah whatever ) and went back upstairs. So hours later  I came down to get the vacuum. This is what the conversation was like. 



Her: I didn't think you wanted your dinner... 


Me: ....What?...


I forgot what she said after that because I was getting a little irritated, but we exchanged a few words.


Her: Hun... your dinner is in the fridge, ok...?



Me: Alright whatever..


So I took the vacuum upstairs and started, and shortly after I said forget this. So I brought the vacuum downstairs. 


Me: Hey you know what? , Uh you can do the downstairs, since your down here. 


Her: No its fine, forget it, just put it back in the closet. 





Me: Na it's all you, there you go. 



I walked off after that.


Her: You know what, I have been busting my ass here!! 

I can't remember what she said directly after that.


Her: When I get back from picking your dad up, I'm going back to my daughters!




Me: Ok, don't go, I'm sorry. 





Her: NO, I cant help you, I can't teach you how to be independent, I'm not your mother ok!! 


Now she's right, she's not my mom, but that kinda struck me a bit.



Then she held my hands together and then said "  You have to want this for yourself " 


So we sat on the couch at talked. 

Her: Yesterday I asked you to bring your dirty clothes down, you didn't do it, Ok you left a pile of dishes in the sink, you left the empty pasta salad container in the fridge. You are 17 years old, you should be taking the initiative to do these things! I'm glad that you're going to college later this fall, but it can't just end there! If something happened to your dad, what would you do? How would you provide for yourself?? 


She had a few moments where she'd sorta start raising her voice again, and then calming herself down.


Me: I didn't mean to make you this upset.. 


Her : No..I'm sorry.. 


Things cooled down after that and we got up and hugged eachother, and she told me I was going to be ok.

Me: Hey look I know you're not my mom but I  (  I was going to say that I see you as one ) 

Her: I know, I know, but I'm being a mom to you.



I understood then, she's been cooking for me and waking up early every morning to let the dog out and feed him, and I've been staying up late on the games, so I definitely couldve been more helpful. 


I had to go in my bathroom to process the whole situation, I was still a little mad because I didn't really get to blow off steam like I wanted to, and I verbally heldback because I didn't want to say anything that wouldve ruined our relationship. I stayed in the bathroom for 20 minutes and I heard her say " John... are you ok... John? " I didn't answer though. So I eventually finished the upstairs and came downstairs. My step mom looked like she just got done crying. I made my way into the bedroom to vacuum there. 






I tried to pull the switch on the fan to turn the light on, the whole switch came out so the light was stuck on. So I'm trying to put back in there while dropping a few F bombs. My step mom came in. 

Her: You ok babe? 

Me: No the damn thing came out!


Her: No no no it's ok, look finish vacuuming, I'll find a screw driver to see if I can fix it. 


So after I finished, she told me she used to be fixer out of all her siblings and everything, and then she told me that when my dad got back, she was going to say she broke it. I didn't want her to do that but she insisted. She was unable to attach it together, and she ended up sleeping the whole night with the light on.



When I got my dinner she had to run in because I told her the stove was still on. 

Her: So hey, when your dad gets back we wont tell him about our discussion, and I'm going to say I pulled the switch out. 





Me: You  don't need to do that I can tell him. 

Her: No because I don't know what mood he's going to be in when he returns, and I want you to know that I have you're back, ok? 


What did she mean by " I'm being a mom to you "?

She meant she was treating you like a mom does and giving you practical life advice. She is right. You are 17. That is old enough to take care of yourself. Soon you will be on your own and you will have to do things for yourself. She wants to see you succeed.
I'm married with two sons, we live 1000 miles from our closest family.  I see my mom or dad maybe twice a year.  My inlaws I haven't seen in years.  Forget aunts and uncles and cousins. My sister moved a year ago even further away with no intention of getting together anytime in the future. When I complain about this I'm met with "well you chose to move away" while true I didn't choose to have a child born with heart problems who hasn't been cleared for high elevation where they all live.  I just get so sad sometimes, missing my family. I hope someday I get to be a Gramma and I will be the best one ever. 
I'm so sorry. It is really hard being away from family. My in laws are only 10 minutes away, and my parents are two hours away. We had the opportunity to move across the country, but we just couldn't do it. Even two hours can be a lot. I was supposed to visit my parents this weekend, but they are sick and I am really bummed about it. I miss spending time with my mom and grandma and sister and niece (my sister is in the process of adopting). I would see them a lot more if I lived closer. We talk all the time. It isn't the same. You are doing what is best for your child. It takes a lot of strength to do that without your family to help support you.
Hello A lunch lady. Sorry my english is not very good, I am a beginner.

I am sorry you feel that way, but I understand you. I moved away from my homecountry too, we don´t speak to my in laws because they are narcissistic people. So no family from my husbands family. My mother is a thief and she betrayed me, I don´t speak to her since last summer.  And my brother and his wife are totaly creepy envious people, not interested in anything but money, only when they need something. I haven´t seen my brother for 5 years and he´s still making up some bullshit when I propose a meeting. 
The only family I have is my husband, my father, and my dog. We don´t have kids yet.
I don´t see my dad often only once in a year, cause I moved away.

See? I feel the same way as you. That´s the reason I got a dog. He makes me so happy.
Sometimes I cry and I feel sad. But it is how it is. When I feel really bad, I tell myself: Emma, you have at least a roof over your head and enough food and a brilliant husband. That´s already much more than many people have. 

So don´t give up, it´s not a problem you feel lonely. If you want to cry, do it. It really helps. I cry also when I feel sad. It´s normal in your situation.

After crying, get a piece of cake and join us here on Reddit!  :)  You´re never alone here ! :)
Thank you, I know it's silly to complain on Reddit but it's good to hear some encouragement so thank you.  
Thank you so much.  Sometimes I have remind myself my family was never the close knit, involved family I wish I had.  I'm gonna go get some cake now too thanks :)
You are very welcome. Everyone needs to vent sometimes.
I hate being very "first world problems" but honestly just need to rant. My family treats me like shit no matter what. Especially my brother and I try and talk to my parents about it and they don't do anything in fact they yell at me for even accusing their "precious son". My brother physically and mentally abuses me all the time, and no not like horse play, he's physically beats me all the time, but that's better than all the nasty shit he says to me. Like I'm fat, ugly, and is one of the dumbest people alive and has no actual worth and that he'll be surprised if someone loves me. It's just really hard and I feel my depression getting worse and worse each day. In the past I thought about killing myself and I wanted to get help so I went to my dad about it. He laughed and hit me and told me to shut the fuck up and stop. I just always feel alone and lost and dead. I can't wait till this is all over. 
Sorry that's happening to you. Maybe it'll motivate you to do really well in school, go to a great college, and then get a really great job to create a better life that you always wanted. Don't let your abusive family define your future, let it motivate you! 
Do you have access to an adult outside of your home that you trust? Maybe at school or church? Or a friends parent? It is not safe for you to be in your home with your brother and it has gone far enough. If your parents refuse to admit this is happening then you need to tell someone outside of your family circle. You can also try child protective services if you are under 18.  Have you considered the police? I realize that is a heavy choice. Your brother has a problem, not you. Please, please do not give up. I am sorry you are hurting, sending a big hug. Stay safe. 
thank you so much, means a lot 
I'm rooting for you. I didn't get along with my family and when I was able to get a job, I gained a sense of freedom and relief of not having to deal with them. Things got better during college when I made friends who brought positivity in my life. Hang on there! There's so much out there that's waiting for you to see and experience! 
Thank you so much :'-)
Cousins, siblings, aunts, uncles, etc vs friends. I do. This has been my social life since graduating college. I love it, I know some of my friends have criticized it, but they're always invited. It's not my fault they have no cool family members to chill with. Who feels the same way? Who doesn't? 
I see my family a lot.

My mother found my diary entry I wrote when I was 15, now she says she wants revenge. In the diary entry I call her evil, and I say I am ashamed to have her as a mother. Now she is threatening to beat me so badly that it may cause permanent damage.
I was wondering about calling cps. Has anyone here ever called cps? How has that worked out for you? Were you taken away, or...?
Get somewhere sacr and call them. 
This mum speaks really powerfully about going back to uni to improve the lives of her family. Plus her kids are adorable! https://youtu.be/eTPRC6Q_Pk4
I was born into this family as the 6/7 child and I was the last girl born.  I don't really remember details about my first home,  as I left it when i was 4 or 5, just glimpse of memories.  My mom and dad crammed us into a little two bedroom house on the reserve. I still remember that house and drive by if I happen to find my self back on the reserve (incredibly rare chance) 

I remember the long drive way that ran along the garden we would tend to. I especially remember the trees that surrounded the house , and how each of my siblings and I claimed a tree of our own and we always knew were each other hid. 

I remember my first memory of my little  brother (nicknamed Frank) in my jolly-jumper (boy I was pissed,  he was only a year younger than me ) I tried to shake him out of it, but my weak toddler arms could only shake him back and forth, he thought it was fun! 

I remember playing dress up with my sister Beaver Bones(her nickname) how we stayed up late one night while the adults talked and hung around the house. I was falling asleep and you weren't done the game we were playing. 
 
I remember one morning my sibling were crying and terrified, I didn't understand. Mom was standing in front of us facing Dad, and he was holding a knife to her, I remember her standing bravely up to dad and not backing away from us. I know he didn't end up stabbing mom, but he did beat her. In that house in that age I don't remember it happening but I was young. I got to see it later at my step mom's house, 

Then I remembered my sibling were gone and I was left alone with mom. Just me. 6 siblings were taken with dad and I was left behind I wasn't even the baby.

I remember more when I was alone with mom, how we used to watch North of 60 on the couch and cuddle (I would cry for moments like this when I was put in foster home and missed my mom) 

I remember mom brushing my hair for me in a rush to get to school one morning, while I brushed my teeth, I didn't have a tooth brush I had to use my finger. 

I remember after a while people would come over, and stay all night,and holy crap were they loud! They'd laugh and talk over each other and stomped around the house while I stayed hidden in the basement away from the commotion and noise. I remember shouting and chairs scraping the floor and fall over, there were a few loud bangs ands the party had turned into a brawl. 

I remember an anther night where mom got into a fight with her friends she was drinking with, I was upstairs this time. Mom's cousin hit her and mom went flying to the wall. I jumped up on a bench and yelled at the woman "not to hit my mom!" She slaps me hard to the ground I land a few feet back from were I was standing.  Then she jumps on me and starts hitting, and slapping me. Imagine a full grown woman laying into a 5 year old little girl. Mom jumps in and gets the crazy bitch off me,and  they're fighting. Some one else jumps in and it's two on one, mom manages to get out of it as another person jumped in and they were ganging up on her and grabbed me and booked it out of our own house. 
 The whole party is against her I don't know why I didn't understand.  She threatens to send a boulder through the front window, but decides against it. 

We walk into the night away from my childhood home, full of new found enemies ( most were supposed to be family). It's cold and I'm only in my pj's,  we stop a while away to rest by a power pole, mom sit me on her lap and shoves my tiny frame under her sweat shirt, it 's warm and I fall asleep with mom crying.

We bounced around from a few different homes after that living with relatives, one time we went to the city. Mom met up with some friends and we went shopping, I got a brand new Barbie doll! (I loved it , her hair changed colour!!) And mom got a case of pilsner to split with her friends. 
Somewhere we lost mom's friends and found ourselves walking around the city, eventually we were walking out of the city. It was a hot day and mom put back a few beers, she decide to rest on the side on the road, saying she needs a nap. 
 So there's me a little 5 yr old playing by the side of the highway, with a passed out mom. I was that kid.
I played with my Barbie while mom slept for an hour or so ( the sun lowered quite a bit)

Then one day dad shows back up, demanding Me.  They argue ,  Dad leaves and mom rallies a place to hide me.  She sends me to my cousins who lived down the hills from us. I don't know how but dad did eventually show up to my cousins unknown to mom.
 I didn't see them at mom's but my older brother(junior)  and sister (cowbelle)  were in the van! 

They asked if I wanted to go for ice cream, Of course I wanted Ice cream! Ice cream is the best! I hop in the van and away we go. It doesn't dawn on me until after I woke up in a different province, that there is no ice-cream! I've been tricked into jumping into my dad's Van and he wisked me away to my step mom's house 10 hours away in the next province. 

I wasn't in the best place with mom or dad, but I couldn't imagine sending my child away somewhere I though she was safe, only to send her into the arms of someone she tried to keep me away from. 

I then moved in with my step family...


 






I don't know if this is necessarily the right place for this but it feels appropriate. My parents are really getting to be borderline unbearable for me (and my sister as well). A bit of background about me for context. I just turned 22 and am slowly trying to move away from my family and get my own life started, because I don't want to be associated with them. I'm still in school but just got my first apartment which is great because I don't have to be at home as much and deal with everything. My goal is to be secure enough to not need anything from them so I can just cut them off clean and not have to worry about surviving. I'm not there yet. But here's what the deal is.

My dad is overly emotional and he takes out his insecurities on the rest of us. He's unhealthily overweight and will constantly have these phases where he tries to be healthier and he always gives up within a week. He just doesn't try anymore with anything and he's always angry and miserable. I would say he started to really get bad once he got a facebook account. Since then all he does is share political nonsense and constantly start arguments with literally anybody on facebook. I'm not going to let this post get political, but it's important to note that he is very heavily influenced by politics in an area where his particular political views are opposite from the general climate in our region, that's all I'll say about that. Point is, he constantly starts arguments when someone so much as mentions anything negative about the people he supports. It's become a joke among my friends because he's just so ridiculous sometimes. I believe he could be bipolar or have some sort of personality disorder. When I was a teenager there would be borderline family breaking episodes because of him overreacting. He has had emotionally abusive episodes towards both me and my sister. There have been times when I was afraid to go home because of his rage. It has been scary at times, I particularly remember a time my sister commented on something offensive he said on facebook. She was not being rude or disrespectful to him, rather just pointing out that he had said something offensive and hurtful and he called her on the phone and was screaming, like full on angry rage filled screaming and horrible name calling for like a half hour. I was involved in this same issue (I also criticised his behavior on a public network) and he didn't even scold me, it was only because my sister said something and he thinks that because she's a woman that he can control her. She was 17 at the time and he felt like since she was still a child that he had some sort of control or ownership of her. The biggest reason I went off to college was so that I had an excuse to be away from him, and even though I'm not doing well and am generally depressed with my schoolwork, it's better than being obligated to put up with him.

As far as my mom goes. She is just so far gone mentally. There's nothing medically wrong with her, as in she has no disability. But she is very obviously an internet addict. A while back (maybe 5-6 years) she quit her teaching job because she was part of the special ed dept and those programs are horribly misunderstood. She then got involved in some sort of online marketing business of sorts. I have no idea still what exactly she does but I am certain that it's a scam. I have no idea what she does all day but she's always on her computer literally all day. She has since gotten a part time job because what she was doing was not making any money (even though she claims to make millions, yet I've seen our bank account, we do not have millions). She never pays attention to my dad anymore which takes an emotional toll on him. In general, she's just so spacey and doesn't ever seem like she's mentally present. She will honestly go all day without eating because she's just on the computer all day.

I can't stand being around them anymore. Honestly I wish they would just get a divorce because their lives are both miserable and pathetic and at least my dad is hurting himself by trying to make things work when they just aren't. I've given up on my mom, she just doesn't care about anyone but herself and I wish they would just get a divorce or something.
All you can do is keep your distance. Unfortunately, you can't make people get help or change.
So I'm a bit confused. I've been dating my bf for 2 years now. He has his kids every other weekend. His youngest is an 11 year old boy.  I have a son that's 13. 
I'm confused by the behavior of the 11 year old and his father. The 11year old wants to babied and close to father at all times. When we go out the son always wants to hold his hand. When we are are home the son wants snuggle time with dad and be read to and tucked in at bedtime. He also wants his father to serve him his food. (Put food on the dish etc) His father does all these things for him. 
My son was that way when he was a much younger age 6-8 years of age. 
My question is this normal? When I watch other boys this age, I never see them holding dads hand in amusement parks etc.  I guess my son grew up on his own quicker?
Sometimes it's quite annoying especially when the son starts "baby" talking. My bf also allows his son to interrupt everything he's doing. Wether it's working in the yard, talking or playing sports etc. 
It can get overwhelming for me that his father is babying him so much. Is this normal? If not how do I approach the conversation without him getting upset at me?  
At a guess, he doesn't get to see his dad a lot and so he wants to be babied. But I am unsure. Make sure to cross post this to /r/parenting as you will get more responses.
There could be a couple things at play here. Since the child only sees his dad every other week he may just want as much attention as possible while he does. The other force at work here could be manipulation on the child's part. He also wants to limit the attention his dad pays to you and your son. He may be feeling threatened by the fact that you also have a son especially if you & your bf live together which means he would be interacting with your son more than his own just because of the living situation. 
As for whether it's normal or not, it's hard to say as kids all mature differently but at 11 most boys don't exhibit the kind of behavior your describing. They're actually trying to show their independence at that age more than anything. It could also be an extreme, prolonged  case of separation anxiety. My kiddo had it for quite some time but she eventually  grew out of it.
In the case of your bf since you didn't mention that he seems surprised by this behavior maybe this isn't new behavior & just the way his son has acted all the time so he's used to it & sees nothing wrong. Or he could also feel some guilt over the fact he sees him only every other week and therefore gives into the behavior.
I'm not quite sure what the best approach would be to avoid conflict as it's always difficult to hear critiques about your child (speaking from experience) but it should definitely be a conversation you have as it seems it's starting to take a toll on your relationship.
He's like this with him mum also. 
Hi all, I wrote about my mother last time that she was abusive and cruel. She caused lots of emotional problem in her and in me. 

And anyway, now I'm in abroad and working. 
Since I'm living with bf's parents, they ask me about my parents and if they gonna visit me or not or if I contact them or not.

Since I don't hv good relationships with them, this kind of attention and questions or even mentioning about my parents bothers me and makes me anxious and want me to avoid to talk with my bf's parents. 

I know it's not their fault that I hv bad feeling when they mention about my parents. And also I don't want them feel gloomy as me when they think about my parents. (That's why I'm hesitating to say truth that I don't contact them properly and even hearing about them cause me stress.)

I alr mentioned to them about some faults of my parents but I guess they don't take it seriously as me so that's why they keep mentioning about them. (Or bcos I mentioned it became better now) 

I understand since they r parents of my bf, and they become curious or just finding subject to talk w me... but i really don't want to talk about my parents or meet my mom especially and father as well. 

What would be wise ? Is it gonna be ok to say I don't wanna talk about them when they ask or sth? 

Or just pretend It's normal relationship and say whatever sounds ok...  (I'm also feeling not ok to tell about my dark memory regarding parents to anyone so I hope I can just not mentioning about them at all if I can...) 


Thanks for reading and plz comment if u can. 


Why should't it be OK to say you don't wanna talk about them? You don't have to tell them any details about your relationship with your parents, but just say you don't want to talk about it, or perhaps better that you don't get along with them, and you won't have to be anxious about further questions.
Thanks for the comment. Really appreciate it 
Hi /r/family!

I just want to post a quick update on the research recruitment study that we posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/60oy66/dads_we_need_your_thoughts_on_parenting_please/)!

Since March when we posted the study, we've had over 500 men participate in the survey, some of them from this sub! That is an amazing turnout! It truly brings me great happiness that men and parenting is getting a huge amount of attention!

We are still short of our target number in our attempts to study how to support fathers and their children and spouse. If you or if you know any dads that fit the criteria, please consider taking or forwarding the study!

Here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/60oy66/dads_we_need_your_thoughts_on_parenting_please/

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me or comment below. I'll try my best to get back to you!
I ran away from home when I was 15. I was pregnant with my now 6 year old daughter. I grew up being abused physically, mentally and, sexually by my father and did not want my daughter there. I have 5 siblings who were never mistreated my my father. 

I have an old email address that I check sporadically. This is the only way my family knows how to contact me. I usually have emails from my mom (tellibg me what a horrible liar I am or begging to see my daughter) and sometimes updates from my older siblings. I haven't replied in years.

Yesterday I saw a email from a unfamiliar address. It was from my younger brother telling me he is graduating and inviting me, he also gave me detailed updates on my siblings, which is more info than I have gotten in years. He asked me to please reply even if I don't come. I haven't seen or heard from him since he was 12. I miss him and my siblings, especially the younger ones. 

I am not going. I doubt I will even go to the state again unless my father and ex are dead. Maybe even not then. I just don't know what to say back. My family knows nothing about me; where I live, my job, how many children I have, nothing. I prefer to keep it that way but I don't want to ignore him or give some hollow reply. I miss him and I wantbto see him but I can't. 

I don't know what to do.
It is up to you to decide if you want to reply. It id okay if you don't. If you want to talk to this sibling then you should. Be careful with what information you give. Go slow and see how it goes.
Tell him your decision and how you feel, and that you miss him.  He deserves that much, doesn't he?
I'm not sure how much he even knows . He knows my parents were hard on me and I hated my dad but 13 and up (10 and up for him) I tried to stay out the house as much as possible running away to friends and boyfriends houses. He has probably seen my father hit me once or twice. I'm sure he has always been told I was just a problem child. 

I don't want to start drama the first time talking to him in years. To my other sibling my father was a normal dad and they loved him. 
I understand.  I was the only sister my brother molested, chiefly because I was the only girl younger than he.  To the rest of the family he used to be a great Dad, Little League coach, and Deacon of the church.  *THEN* he was finally caught in the act, with a child not of our family.  My sisters insisted it was a mistake but I contacted the prosecuting attorney and faxed him my story, offering to testify in court if necessary.  Fortunately it didn't come to that as my other brother had witnessed much of the abuse and could verify my claims.  

Is there any way your Dad's been caught out?  Have you checked the newspapers that cover your hometown?  
Nope he is still the innocent Father of the Year as far as anyone else ia concerned.

That was good and brave of you to be willing to testify. I have never been that brave.
I'm not a very brave person, emotionally speaking.  What made it impossible for me to turn my back on what was happening was the fact that I'd told my family what he was doing and no one did anything to stop him.  I just kept thinking about that little girl, and how I was the only one who could back up her story -- I couldn't leave her hanging out to dry the way they did me, I couldn't live with myself if I did! I had a choice: Family, or the girl?  I chose the girl.  My sisters and other brother began speaking to me after a few years, my father never was told about the trouble as it would have broken his heart and he was almost 90 by then.  But even if none of my siblings ever spoke to me again it would have been worth it.  *Nothing should ever* come before the safety and comfort of a child.
So I wrote this diary entry when I was 15. In the entry I wrote about my mother's parenting skills and how I thought she was evil. I wrote about how she liked to sabotage her children's future. I even wrote about how I was ashamed to say she was my mother. This was because my mother is really abusive. She hits me, calls me terrible names, etc. She got really upset reading this and said she was going to cut me off as a daughter. What should I do?
If you can move somewhere else and cut all your connection with your mother. Now I am not an expert in these kind of situations but this is the only solution I can think of. Hope you can solve your problem.
I know cutting your mum off is an intense thing to do. Maybe a big break from her. Sometimez it's important to take time off from family
I agree with the others. Get away from her. Being with an abusive person is toxic and it doesn't get better. Just because she is your mom doesn't make her a good person.
I'm 16 and live with my little brother, grandma, and mother. They both work and I have to watch my brother very often and takes up a shit ton of my free time /: My grandma told me that she applied for a job that pays much less and said "can't have everything but you won't have to watch your brother as much" I think she's trying to guilt trip me for complaining about how much I watch him. I don't want her to take a job that means we'll be barely making it more than we are. What should I do? 
So you're complaining about not being the one that works and has to watch your brother, and then when they find a solution you're still complaining? 

I don't mean this in a nasty way. But I would much rather be able to stay at home and just watch a kid than have to work... consider that maybe your complaining upsets them. You've got the easy side of it. If you really feel that bad you're old enough to get a part time job on weekends or something when they're not working for the extra money. 

I'm sorry if I come across as nasty or abrasive. I know you're a teenager and you probably want to do your own thing. But unfortunately your mom and grandma have to work so you can eat and have a comfortable bed and a roof over your head. Consider looking after the kid as a thank you to them until you're old enough to start bringing in money too.
Ignore it. Don't give her the satisfaction of a reaction.
It's not a "solution" as much as I hate it the current situation is fine, I just hate that I don't even get a simple thank you for it. It's her guilt tripping me like always, that's a whole other issue that doesn't really have a solution. I just don't want it to be my fault if we can't pay bills or something. Honestly I wish I could get a job, it would be time out of the house at least, but I don't have the time. My mom won't even let me get my permit, she's even said she would disown me if I move out. So yeah it's actually way deeper than me just being whiny I literally can't do anything. My is just plain controlling. 
Learning that responsibility doesn't merit gratuity is part of growing up. To assume they don't appreciate what you do is just plain wrong. They sacrifice parts of their own free time to work more to provide shelter for you, clothing and food for the family. All they ask in return is for some help so that they can continue to provide for you and the family. You say you don't have a job so where do you think the video games come from? Do they just fall from the sky for people who have done nothing to earn them? Stop and consider for a moment that the life you have is a result of them seeing value in what you're contributing.  They DO show appreciation but you're too caught up in the phrase 'thank you' to see it.

You're playing the victim here but have you stopped to consider that this is exactly the result of you yourself doing the guilt tripping? Do you think your grandmother would have offered to sacrifice income and parts of her non-work life if there wasn't a factor driving her to do so? 

You can't have all the free time you want and still expect to be a contributing member of the family. Man up and accept your role in this, your family is counting on you. 

I used to think I had problems like this. Then I moved out at 18 because of superficial problems that made me "hate" my parents. I now live in a piece of shit apartment, work 40-50 hours a week and come out piss poor every month. I regret it every day. You might not get along with them or like them but I think maybe you should be grateful that they both work for you and all you have to do is watch a kid. You might not get on with them all that much but I don't think your situation is all that bad.
Every time they frustrate you or make you feel guilty or unimportant just remember what they do for you every day. I know it's really shitty because I've been in the exact same situation. I think some of it is that they wish they were the ones not having to work and they take it out on you. 

I'm feeling kinda bad for the way I'm coming across. In no way am I trying to be a dick or be rude or belittle your situation. 
I just can't wait to get out and have my own life, I hate being stuck inside constantly with no real purpose other than go to school and watch a child that's not even mine. 
Your day will come eventually. :)

What about picking up a hobby to do while you have to watch him? Something that gives you satisfaction?
Like what? I play video games but honestly they get boring quickly to me
What interests you? I'm only 20 but I knit. What about painting miniature models? Do you play on a PC? What about learning coding? Are you artsy? Do you like to cook or bake? 
Well, thats a great question, I think we should ask the Magic 8 Ball. 

 *^shake ^shake* 

**Im [confused](/r/confusing), ask again later!**
I actually like to cook but I'd probably get killed if I used the stove or oven when no one is home. I don't play on PC. I love music with a passion but I'm not sure how that can be a hobby. 
Do you play any instruments? 
I've tried percussion and saxophone in middle school but I didn't really like it
What about a new instrument?
You know, if you like to use the computer, perhaps you'd like to consider mixing music? I'm not a huge expert on computers, but if it comes with a simple editing software, you might be able to mixing some stuff together. It's like playing a jigsaw puzzle!
To start off I am under 18 and so is my sister. My sister and I are very different people, her being a very popular cheerleader party type girl and I'm a sort of a weird nerd. Our relationship has never been good but it is currently at an all time low. She is not at home very often, but when she is or whenever we're at school she will do anything possible to avoid me, and if we do see each other she is extremely hostile. This is past the point of siblings fighting, as we cannot go one sentence without bickering. She's been emotionally and physically abusing me for years now (for example she duck taped my hands and feet together and put me on the top bunk of a bunk bed and locked the door as she left, which resulted in me falling and hitting my head hard on something made of wood, and this is when I was around 4 or 5). She still physically abuses me by constantly pull my hair as hard as she can for no reason, knowing I can't hit back considering I would get in major trouble for even thinking of hitting a girl, and she emotionally abuses me by constantly making fun of me. I can't think of a time where she has said something even remotely positive about me. I also believe she has been stealing money from me and doing a lot of other messed up things, I really want a good relationship with my sister so is there any way I can fix this? If not what would be the best thing for me to do? 
You talk to your parents because that is beyond unacceptable.
If you really hate her and can't take it anymore, i advice you expose half a cup if milk in the air for up to 3 days, get the molds in there and place it in her food. Soon she will get sick from food poisoning.

Damn I thought my sister was a level 9000 b***h until i saw this, i think i love my sister now
They want us to sort out our own issues
Yeah that would not fly with my parents
If she is hitting you and hurting you it needs their intervention. This is beyond sibling issues.
I'm aware it's my parents who aren't 
I understand. It just drives me nuts when parents refuse to parent. Try talking to a guidance counselor. Maybe that will force your parents to act.
This has nothing to do with my brother, but my father. I dropped contact with my father about 4 months ago and have had no plans to open that relationship up anytime soon. My brothers graduation is tomorrow and my dad will be there. I really am dreading this and don't want to see or talk to him, but I don't want to miss my brothers graduation either. It's my brothers BA graduation and I'd really hate to miss something like this, but I'm not sure if I want to sacrifice my well being to support him.
Do you nessecarily NEED to see him? And vice versa? Graduations are huge events dude. Hide in the back. Fuck that guy.
You don't need to sit with him. Go, support your brother and of your dad botherw you, walk away.
Go see your bro on his special day, you don't have to speak or even achknowledge your father.
Youngest of 3 brothers (nearly 20 y.o), both parents.

Both older brothers (25 and 24) have relatively successful careers in their chosen fields, banking and engineering, whereas me, I've been unemployed since November.

"Dad" completely hates me, we had a fight in February, which resulted in the decision that I best move out sooner or later (I made this choice, I hate being at home)

Brothers have completely disowned me, they have told me to end my life and  deny any relation to them (due to embarrassment) every other week, they have nothing nice to say to me to boost my spirits.

But they do this thing on social media where they make it look like we're all one happy family who care about each other, when it's far from the case. I've blocked them, they wished to be denied being related to their little brother, have it that way then, right?, I've denied being related before, people are starting to think I'm an only child.

Being unemployed since November has taken its toll on me mentally, I've had negative thoughts but I've been doing volunteer work at my friend's dad's convenience store on the other end of the city with my friend to gain further experience. I don't get paid, but I meet nice people regularly, they always ask how I've been since the day before or so.

I'm unsure where I stand, a family who who might as well hate me to death and a some next level career path.

Any advice? 

Edit: I don't tell my family I do volunteer work, they look down on anything similar to it, they are ignorant, rude, hurtful, cocky, quite immature and stupid as well, they talk behind peoples backs and they just aren't nice company.
While voluneteering is good, you dhould be paid if you are working in a conviencd store. Take any job you can. Ignire your family. It is hard to find work. It is awful that they are acting like this. They are the disgraceful ones.
My dad recently passed away last August …5 days before my wedding day ….  of liver tumors. He was 73 years old. I was lucky to have him for 29 years of my life. I am struggling to find peace in all of this . He was my best friend. He wasn’t my blood father but he raised me since I was 6 months old. I miss him terribly . When I think of him … it’s like I lose my breath and the tears just come out and I cry like I’ve never cried before. I never knew real heartbreak until the day I lost him.  He visits sometimes in my dreams…. I’m thankful for that . I’m just patiently waiting for the pain to ease …… #love #loss
Im sorry to hear that man, but now your dad is in a better place where he will never have to experience any grief. The good thing is you'll see him again and live with him forever in the next life which is eternal...
We never get our the tough losses, we just learn to live with them. It can take about a year to really get back to normal. It is okay to grieve. Even though he is gone the love you shared is still there in your heart and it always will be. Hold onto that love.
Thank you !!  I'm glad he's not sick anymore . I have voicemails from him saying he's tired of feeling this way .... makes me sad that he was suffering . You know 
Its all temporary bro. We're sent here so we live our life as a test for the next one. Its always sad to say goodbye to our loved ones but we can take comfort in the fact that their times of hardships in this world have finished. And we'll see them again :)
Okay Reddit. I'm in a lot of shit and freaking out.
I'm a Canadian girl, 17 years old. 
My parents never married but were together for 17 years prior to my dad moving.  My dad left for two years, under premises that he wanted to be closer to his dying father. I went abroad for the first year with him when I was 15 and found out he had cheated and he made my life hell. Then I returned home and spent an awesome year with just mom. But my monster of a controlling dad wants to return. We live in his house in Canada while he was staying in Malta. We just found out he will be coming by June 1. Fuck. Mom hasn't officially gotten separation document and wont have time before he arrives but she is speaking to a lawyer. Apparently she has compensation rights, but him being here makes things so much more complicated. Are we able to kick him out of his own place if we both in court say we want him gone? We don't have enough money to move elsewhere.
I never wanted to see him again and now he's returning. God. 
I don't know the laws there. I am sorry for what you are going through. I would listen to the lawyer. 
I will cherish this interview for the rest of my days. I revoked my man card for this episode because I got choked up at the end. Hope you'll listen if you're inclined :)

My sister who is 24 now cannot talk to other adults. Whether this is for where she works, calling an insurance company, or an adult that is being confrontational with her.

I am the older brother and I'll admit I've been an ass to her sometimes. I just don't understand why she has this hang up about talking to adults. She will argue her point to my mother and I. But will not when it comes to other people. 

I just worry that she will not be able to move forward if she keeps up with what she say "sounding stupid" which she is not. 

Is this an insecurity thing or something else I am not aware of? I am willing to help her but she is 24 now myself and my mother should not have to be doing the "adulting" for her at this point in her life... 
She needs counseling. Lots of people are non confrentational, but she needs to be able to function.
My mom took her retirement money to put her in counseling a few years ago...
If she refuses to help herself there isn't much you can do. It sucks, but people have to help themselves.
The current situation in my home is that my family refuses to do chores. Even I'm guilty of this but I have justification, if I spend half an hour doing dishes and cleaning all of my work can and will be undone in minutes. I can't do chores when all my work only benefits the people who do no work. I would happily start doing my share if the others did but the situation has gotten to the point that we refuse to even talk to each other. Now there are rotten dishes and no one will work. How can I convince people to listen and help? I want to have a clean house but I can't do it alone.
Move out. 
Unfortunately, you can't force everyone to be clean. It's tough when you are the kid because no one listens to you. I say clean so you are comfortable.
That's a bit tough seeing as I'm 17. :\
Yeah, sorry to have been flippant. Kudos to you for rising above your environment. At least you can look forward to the point - quite soon - when you CAN move out. Stay strong in the meantime. 
    

  I grew up an only child, I remember around the age of five my grandmother driving around my home town with me in backseat looking for my mother. My mother was a runaway due to my biological father not wanting to be apart of my mothers life, and couldn't due to he was an older male, and my mom a teenager in the 80's it was consider rape. my immediate family would tell me my mother use to run away from home with me a lot. 
  As I got older I recall my grandmother taking me away from my mom and raising me. I remember grandma telling her she was not a good mother. yet my childhood was bittersweet because grandma always made sure I was provided for. I always had nice clothes, shoes, and toys, yet her husband would steal my stuff, and give them away to other kids mothers he was cheating on my grandmother with. My childhood was very rich in wealth I had everything but love, attention, and support. Briefly remind you I have experience personal incest, and sexual molestation in this family from age 5 all the way up until I was 15 years old. I was not allowed to cry; or express my emotions. My family are very prejudice, and have tried to teach me to be that way, but I choose not to grow up to be prejudice. My Grandmother would always beat my mom really bad, and completely took control over my moms life. she wouldn't let my mother have a relationship with me because my mom was to busy being her slave, and living her life for her. it's 2017, and until this day my grandmother treats my mom like a slave. It's been like this since I was a young toddler, and ever since my mom was a teenager.
 Grandmother never let me meet my original grandfather which was my mothers father, because the man grandma has been married to for almost 30 years of marriage the family step grandfather, and stepfather never had a personal relationship with me, his only daughter; or my grandmothers other kids; or his only biological real grandson who is 15 years old. This evil grandfather hates him, and does the same shit to him, he use to do to me; and my grandmother allows it. My grandmother allowed him to sale my first car that was a gift to me when I was 16 years old and he kept all the money. I could not even file taxes for working as a teenager to even improve my quality of life, because she also allowed him to claim me on taxes every year something I never knew about. I remember the nights my grandmother and her husband would fight, argue,  break dishes, him, and her both bleeding in the house. she accusing him of women in the backseat of his car for work which was true he always worked late, came home smelling like soap and perfume found tubes of lipstick in his car and never came home. my grandmother beat my ass because her husband would steal her money and jewelry  he would accuse me I never stole from my family or anyone for that matter and my grandma would whenever he would buy food as a kid he would tell me that was his food and my grandmother would also tell me that was his food don't mess with his food. he has cheated on her multiple times and she took him back plus she cheated on him and he still remain with her one night they got into a fight she put me out the house because I jumped on him for defending her. I never grew up in a functional home with these people because all i ever known them to do was fight, and argue. if grandma was not drunk and gambling in casinos, she would Get all the kids and grand kids involved in they married issues. when i had relationships of my own my grandmother always found fault in everyone i every dated or loved and anything i did was never good enough for her unless it was her dream or vision or she had something to do with it. she never came to any of my school events as a child she wouldn't let my mom even be supportive of me because my mom was really her nanny of the house. my grandmother has been apart of all of her kids and grandkids relationships and have argued with each, and everyone of our mates. Grandma always tried to run, and control our relationships. her husband my step grandfather was cruel and very abusive as well because of him hating all my grandmothers sons and grandkids both of my uncles are both dead because he didn't want them there at the house and because they have fought him to as a child. They pretty much raised themselves and left home young and ended up dying so i had no father figures, no uncles, no brothers, just two abusive grandparents who have been in a dangerous abusive relationship for years. The relationship has been so awful and sabotage our entire immediate family me, or the others don't know how to have healthy relationships with lovers, co workers, or friendships don't last long for us. me personally I moved away from the family in my early twenties trying to find my own way, and leaving my horrible child hood I never had behind me. when I got in the world I was not prepared for it so I made every reckless careless mistake of not knowing how to love myself because no one never showed me that. i ended up moving home back a few times and she would always say i don't know why you keep leaving you need me. once again i am about to leave it's been so hard for me because this family is the only life i ever knew I'm afraid of the world and alone until this day i never had a good role model or someone who did the right thing that set an example for me as an adult. the year is 2017 my grandmother health is declining she is on borrowed time and she wants me to be apart of the family again, and i have tried but all the abuse is still present until this day even in they're 70's fighting is very present and arguing. had i forget to mention i moved away from this family and cut them off completely before i am about ready to do it again it just hurts to know that this is not a joke and this is the only painful life i ever knew and if i cut them all off for good that means i will be in this world alone until i build a family of own. please give me advice. because i am ready to move on and just completely cut them off no matter how much it hurts or how alone i feel but all my childhood and early adult life was always negative and dysfunctional yet granny even with her health issues always uses her other kids to put a guilt trip on me by not being apart of the family and not wanting to visit or see them because of all the drama that goes on 365 days we can't even go out together in a public restaurant, or have a decent holiday it's almost cult like my grandmother has complete control over the husband and all her kids none of my aunts or my mom have a personal life they all stay with my grandmother i am the only one who feels this is not normal for my grandmother to not want us to live on our own and wants us under her 24 seven or always has to know our everymove sometimes even me but only when I come to visit I just made up in my mind that I will finish my life journey alone but I need advice because I am very unhappy yes I love forgive and moved on with all the bad that I have endured but now that I am grown I don't want that past in my life am I wrong for disowning my family
Dying doesn't suddenly make a bad person good. You need a good therapist to sort all this out. I recommend getting as far away from these people as you can and never look back!
Thank You so Much xoxoxoxo seriously  I need all the advice I can get these people have ruined me and I am in town now but planning to leave this time again for good it's so sad i wish i was lying to you nothing as changed and they all want me to stay, and be apart of a family that is still like this in 2017 it's painful but i guess i have not accepted my family is fucked up
