Guide
-----
1. Run initial clustering
$ python clustering.py <path_to_phrase_embeddings>
Where <path_to_phrase_embeddings> is a path to a file that contains embeddings for each word or phrase that you would like to be sorted. These embeddings can be obtained by, e.g., averaging the word embeddings of each word in the phrase.
A file called "hierarchy.graph" will be created as a result.

2. Initiate crowd-powered sorting
$ python sort_hierarchy.py hierarchy.graph
NOTE: you will need to add your mturk keys to the header of this file.
NOTE: this will take some time! You will probably need to wait several days (or more, depending on the size of the intial hierarchy) for the mturk workers to complete the entire sorting process.
A file called "sorted.graph" will be created as a result.

3. View the hierarchy
All .graph files are already in dot format, and can be visualized in as an image using:
$ dot -Tpng <graph_file> -o <output_image_file_name>

4. Define categories
Viewing the image, decide which categories you wish to get word lists for. Add these numbers, one per line, to a file. This will be your <measurable_nodes> file.
At this time, you can also manually modify the graph file if you wish, using any text editor.:w

5. Expand categories and view final lexicon
$ python expand.py <path_to_word_embeddings> <graph_file> <measureable_nodes>
The output from this program will include the lists of all words that fall under your measurable nodes.
